    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Treating patients with type 1 diabetes with a certain antihypertensive drug
      preserve cerebral function during hypoglycaemia.

      Background: Studies have found that certain genetic variations leaves a subject with type 1
      diabetes more prone to hypoglycaemia. It it thought to be a decline in cognition during
      hypoglycaemia that leaves them at risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The idea is tha when you
      suppress the genetic phenotype with a well known antihypertensive drug an improvement in
      cognition will occur and this will remove the patients tendency to severe hypoglycaemia.

      Methods: The investigators want to explore whether the cerebral function is improved during
      hypoglycaemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes and the above mentioned genetic variation when
      treated with the antihypertensive drug Candesartan.

      We will include 25 type 1 diabetic patients from our outpatient clinic. They are already
      genotyped from another trial.

      Each patient goes through two cycles with hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp induced
      hypoglycemia. The study is double blinded, randomised and placebocontrolled so the patients
      receive both Candesartan and placebo but in different cycles.

      In each cycle patients will receive either Candesartan or placebo for 7 days. After 8 days
      patients undergo a hypoglycaemic clamp during which primary and secondary endpoints will be
      measured.

      In the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamp the patients will undergo an adjustment period
      towards euglycaemia. A period of approximately 1 hour of euglycemia, an hour of hypoglycemia
      and a period of recovery towards euglycemia. In each of these glycemic states primary and
      secondary outcomes will be measured.
