  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most children with cancer need a central venous catheter. These catheters are typically
      placed on the anterior thorax, where the risk of hypertrophic scarring and keloid development
      is greatly enhanced. A significant part of the children who have survived childhood cancer
      are troubled by their scars.

      Topical glucocorticoid treatment is known to induce a reduction of the collagen in the
      connective tissue.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with topical glucocorticoids for one week before
      and three weeks after removal of a central venous catheter, will reduce the formation of
      hypertrophic scarring and keloid development in children.
