  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now accepted that physical activity is not deleterious in myopathies, including
      muscular dystrophies. In patients suffering from facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD),
      aerobic training has been reported to be associated to physiological and functional positive
      effects without alteration in quality of life. The review papers from Van der Kooi et al.
      (2005), Cup et al. (2007) and Féasson et al. (2010) suggest that the combination of endurance
      and strength training is even more relevant. Only a few controlled and randomized studies
      have been conducted on this topic. The impact of such training programs on the skeletal
      muscle regenerative capacities has not been yet addressed. Moreover, due to the fact that
      training programs are mainly performed on short-term supervised periods, there is a lack of
      knowledge regarding long-term effects, patient's autonomy and whether or not regular exercise
      practice can be maintained in patient's daily life. Also, only a few experiments have
      reported an integrative view of the potential benefits of such programs on functional,
      biological and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>

      Our research project aims at establishing a program of physical training that will fulfill
      the two following conditions: (i) being compatible with the daily professional, social and
      family activity of the patients so it can be integrated in their life habits and (ii) being
      intensive enough to induce functional benefits. This experimental work will be based on
      multi-factorial evaluations, i.e. biological, physiological, functional, and quality of life
      questionnaires. This work will be based on a collaboration between the Universities of Saint
      Etienne (L. Féasson), Grenoble (B Wuyam) and Örebro (F Kadi) within the Rhône-Alpes Reference
      Centre for Rare Neuromuscular Diseases (JC Antoine).

      It is accepted that exercise therapy can be recommended for patients with myopathies but
      long-term training load still has to be determined for each pathology. In the specific
      context of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, we aim at associating the scientific evaluation of
      physical activity benefits and a therapeutic education of patients in order to contribute to
      recommendations for physicians and physiotherapists. The purpose of this study is to combine
      an integrated approach with a better understanding of biological process implicated in this
      physiological treatment strategy.

    <description>The training will consist in 3 sessions of 35 min of training per week at home on an ergocycle. As a result, lower limb muscles will be mainly solicited. These muscles are heterogeneous in terms of deficiency, but this latter is compatible with cycling. The training will be divided in (i) 2 sessions of 30 min aerobic exercises at a constant but moderate (60% of maximal aerobic power, MAP) intensity followed with 5 sets of 10 revolutions at near-maximal intensity and (ii) an interval-training session. This latter session will consist in 5 min warm-up at 40% MAP followed by 5 times 1 min at 80% MAP (recovery = 4 min at 40% MAP) followed by 5 min of active recovery. Over a 2 to 4 weeks initial period, the program will be conducted in the laboratory or at home under the supervision of a coach. Then a systematic supervision of the sessions by the coach will be performed by phone, by using the heart rate recordings and values of Analogic Visual Scale for pain and fatigue.</description>
