    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open label study being conducted to evaluate the overall safety and
      initial effectiveness of an investigational drug, Eltrombopag in patients who are 60 years of
      age and older and who have Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Eltrombopag is an
      investigational drug, which means it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in this type of disease. Approximately 35 people will be
      enrolled on this study at the University of Pennsylvania

      Primary Objectives (Phase I Portion): 1). To determine the safety and tolerability of
      eltrombopag in elderly subjects with AML 2). To determine the maximally tolerated initial
      starting dose of eltrombopag for elderly subjects with AML Primary Objectives (Phase II
      portion): 1). To better define the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in elderly patients
      with AML at the maximally tolerated starting dose Page 9 of 18 determined in Phase I portion
      of study. 2). To determine the incidence of peripheral platelet count improvement (using
      baseline and response parameters as defined below) for subjects with disease related
      thrombocytopenia. Secondary Objectives (Phase I and II): 1). To preliminarily determine the
      efficacy (using AML response criteria as defined below) of eltrombopag in elderly subjects
      with AML.

      2). To perform ex-vivo analyses using subject AML samples and stock eltrombopag to 1) assess
      leukemic proliferative capacity and 2) investigate potential eltrombopag induced cytoxic
      mechanisms for leukemic cell death. 3). To perform pharmacodynamic assessments of drug
      activity in leukemic cells using subject samples collected at various time points before and
      during drug exposure. 4). To preliminarily correlate pharmacodynamic findings with clinical
      response.

    <measure>Overall response rate (Phase I and Phase II)</measure>
    <description>This will include subjects who achieve a complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery, partial response (PR), and hematologic improvement (HI) based on definitions by the International Working Group (IWG) Of note: subjects who only have HI-platelet (HIp) will not be considered to have had a disease response as this may be due to direct stimulation of meagkaryocytes and not cytotoxic effect</description>

    <measure>Survival, Response and Progression</measure>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first day of therapy to death due to any cause or last patient contact.
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first day of therapy to disease progression, death due to any cause, or last patient contact.
PFS is defined for all patients entered on the study, following an intent-to-treat analysis plan.
Relapse free survival (RFS) Time from complete remission to disease relapse. The time to response is defined as the time from the first day of therapy until the time that measurement criteria are met for response.</description>
