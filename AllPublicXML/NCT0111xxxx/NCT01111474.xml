  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two treatments for dental hypersensitivity:
      cyanoacrylate (Super Bonder速) compared with use of low intensity laser treatment. As the
      cyanoacrylate is a lower cost treatment, the hypothesis in investigation is if this product
      is equally effective as the laser treatment.

    <description>This process was conducted three times with an interval of 48 hours between applications, according to laser's manufacturer advice Clean Line Easy Laser - LILT速, Clean Line Easy Laser Doctor Dental Products Industry LTDA, BRA). For dentin hypersensitivity, the application of 1J/cm2 is recommended for eight seconds at three points along the dental neck, using the infrared wavelength (660nm).</description>
