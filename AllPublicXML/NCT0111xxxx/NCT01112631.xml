    <textblock>
      The patients from 12 centers were included into the study. pN2 patients received PORT, pN1
      patients did not. PORT was 3D-planned and consisted in 54-56 Gy in 27-28 fractions. One month
      after surgery, all patients completed EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaires and had pulmonary
      function tests (PFT); cardiopulmonary symptoms were assessed by modified LENT-SOM score. Two
      years after, all patients free of disease repeated the same examinations. Changes in QLQ,
      LENT-SOM score and the results of PFT were compared for patients receiving and not PORT.

        It was assessed that during planned 3 years of accrual approximately 360 stage II patients
        treated with surgery alone and approximately 240 stage III patients treated with surgery
        and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) would enter the study.The higher number of inclusions
        of pN1 was planned, because of expected higher percentage of cancer related deaths within
        two years in pN2 patients.

        Patients with pN1 disease were followed in the thoracic surgery center and had no PORT.
        Patients with pN2 disease were referred to PORT.
