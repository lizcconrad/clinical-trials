    <description>Specific activity scale was estimated by pre-specified questionnaire (for different activities) to assess the exercise capability of the participants. Answers provided by participants were transformed in terms of number of metabolic equivalents (METs).1 MET was defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest and is equal to 3.5 ml oxygen per kg body weight* minute. Scale ranged from 1 (less than (&lt;) 2 METs) = lowest level of exercise tolerance to 6 (&gt;=8METs) = highest level of tolerance and higher score indicated more tolerance.</description>

        <description>Specific activity scale was estimated by pre-specified questionnaire (for different activities) to assess the exercise capability of the participants. Answers provided by participants were transformed in terms of number of metabolic equivalents (METs).1 MET was defined as the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest and is equal to 3.5 ml oxygen per kg body weight* minute. Scale ranged from 1 (less than (&lt;) 2 METs) = lowest level of exercise tolerance to 6 (&gt;=8METs) = highest level of tolerance and higher score indicated more tolerance.</description>
