  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether repetitive sessions of transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the prefrontal cortex can enhance the cognitive,
      affective and motor functioning of those with Parkinson's Disease.

      In this study we will compare active tDCS with sham tDCS. Each subject will receive two
      consecutive weeks of stimulation (Monday through Friday). A battery of neuropsychological and
      affective tests will be administered throughout the duration of the study.

    <description>In addition to this study we will have an open label arm in which subjects who received sham stimulation through the course of the study will have the opportunity to receive active stimulation free of charge. The same parameters and identical procedures as is done in the original study will be used. Data will be collected as an open label, which will therefore provide additional information. Data obtained from this open label portion of the study will be kept separate.</description>
