  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to identify the best smoking cessation intervention components
      to be combined into a state-on-the-art, comprehensive smoking cessation intervention. This
      research examines the ability of different interventions, provided both prior to and after
      the quit attempt, to maximize the ability to initially quit and then stay quit. The
      investigators will be examining six different treatment interventions: pre-quit nicotine
      patch, pre-quit nicotine gum, pre-quit counseling, post-quit in-person counseling, post-quit
      phone counseling and duration of post-quit nicotine replacement therapy.

    <measure>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post-quit</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence is a dichotomous outcome with values of 0 and 1 where 0=smoking on one or more of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (16 weeks post-quit) and 1=no smoking on any of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (i.e., abstinent for the past 7 days); this outcome will be analyzed in a logistic regression analysis model.
Note: This abstinence primary outcome replaces latency to relapse (now designated as a secondary outcome) because reviewers of the now-accepted manuscript (at the journal &quot;Addiction&quot;) advised us to change the primary outcome to the current week 16 Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will have 20-minute in-person counseling sessions 1 and 3 weeks before their target quit day and a 20-minute phone counseling session 2 weeks before their target quit day. In the in-person counseling session, the case manager will address issues such as smoking reduction, withdrawal coping, environmental restrictions on smoking, intra-treatment social support, autonomous motivation, and practice quit attempts. Participants will be asked to engage in two practice quit attempts. These attempts will each last 8 hours and will be assigned (in collaboration with the smoker) to occur on one weekend day and one weekday the second and third weeks after the quit day.</description>

The clinician will also inform the participant of the sort of phone counseling follow-up that s/he will receive in 1 and 2 weeks after their quit date. (This resembles the real-world situation in which the clinician discusses the sort of follow-up intervention a patient will receive.)</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to intensive in-person counseling will receive three 20-minute face-to-face counseling sessions: one during the week before the target quit day, one on the target quit day and one during the week after the target quite day. The counseling will include intra-treatment social support and skill-based competence intervention components.</description>

    <intervention_name>Minimal phone counseling during the quit attempt</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will receive minimal phone counseling consisting of one 10-minute phone counseling session on the morning of the target quit day. This session will address motivation to quit, strategies for coping with urges to smoke and use of the medication, and will provide support. Thus, all participants will get some counseling support on the quit day, which reflects the fact that initial lapses often occur on the target quit day, and quit day smoking is an important determinant of ultimate outcome.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intensive phone counseling during the quit attempt</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will receive intensive phone counseling consisting of three 15-minute phone sessions (on the morning of the target quit day and on days 2 and 10 after the quit day). The content of the target quit day phone call will emphasize intra-treatment social support, skill execution and avoidance of danger situations. The quit day phone call is intended to augment any other clinician counseling received either on the phone or in person; such interventions tend to have additive effects and produce strong dose-response effects as a function of the duration of the counseling intervention.</description>

        <title>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence</title>
        <description>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence is a dichotomous outcome with values of 0 and 1 where 0=smoking on one or more of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (16 weeks post-quit) and 1=no smoking on any of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (i.e., abstinent for the past 7 days); this outcome will be analyzed in a logistic regression analysis model.
Note: This abstinence primary outcome replaces latency to relapse (now designated as a secondary outcome) because reviewers of the now-accepted manuscript (at the journal &quot;Addiction&quot;) advised us to change the primary outcome to the current week 16 Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence outcome.</description>

            <groups_desc>The logistic regression model effects consisted of six treatment main effects and 15 two-way treatment interactions. The main effects provide direct tests of the primary aim of the study, i.e., determining whether or not more intensive treatments (compared to less intensive treatments; e.g., Short Term (8 Weeks) Postquit Nicotine Patch + Nicotine Gum vs. Long Term (26 Weeks) Postquit Nicotine Patch + Nicotine Gum) would result in significantly higher abstinence at 16 weeks post-quit.</groups_desc>
