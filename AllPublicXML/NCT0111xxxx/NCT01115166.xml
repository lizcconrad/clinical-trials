  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing extracorporal circulation during cardiac operation, the hemoglobin is
      subjected to large changes. The purpose of this study is to see if it is possible with the
      help of volume kinetic techniques to use these variations to measure blood volume and fluid
      escape from the intravascular volume.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many clinical situations, such as extensive surgery, it is of value to determine blood
      volume and rate of fluid loss from the intravascular space, since hypo- and hypervolemia are
      combined with increased morbidity and mortality. In this study we which to use the large
      variations in hemoglobin during extracorporal to calculate both these variables.

      Hemoglobin is measured every 5 minutes during one hour beginning shortly before start of the
      heart-lung machine. When the extracorporal circulation begins the hemoglobin decreases due to
      the quick mix and dilution of the priming fluid from the heart-lung machine with the patients
      blood.

      From the amount of priming fluid and the fall of the hemoglobin, the blood volume can be
      calculated. If no further fluid is given the next 20 to 30 minutes, the hemoglobin
      concentration will in most cases increase as a result of the fluid loss from the vascular
      space. This increase in combination with the diureses can be used to calculate the
      intravascular fluid loss to the interstitium during surgery.

      Sodium concentration will also be measured in parallel with the hemoglobin concentration.

      The Sodium concentrations in combination with given and excreted (urine)Sodium can be used in
      a mass balance to calculate if intracellular edema is induced.

    <description>volume kinetic technique: During start of cardio pulmonary by-pass a known amount of fluid will expand the blood volume and dilute the hemoglobin.
The hemoglobin variation is used to calculate the blood volume. The last hemoglobin value before CPB and the hemoglobin value directly after start (extrapolated from the following 30 minutes after start) of CPB are used in the calculation.
The value for the blood volume directly prior to CPB will be influenced by intra venous fluids given during early stages of the anesthesia.
To achieve the blood volume prior to anesthesia a hemoglobin value before anesthesia and the last hemoglobin value before CPB are used to correct the blood volume calculation. In this way blood volume prior to anaesthesia can be calculated.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The number of patients was small and it was not possible to use a reference method. Standardization was difficult due to the fact that it was a clinical study.</limitations_and_caveats>
