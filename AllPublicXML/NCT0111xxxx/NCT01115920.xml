  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of MTP-131 (Bendavia™) in humans. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single intravenous
      infusion doses of MTP-131.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MTP-131 in
      healthy volunteers following a single intravenous infusion. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MTP-131. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized trial. A total of 40 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 3:1
      active to placebo ratio for a total of 5 treatment groups of 8 volunteers. As far as is
      logistically possible, each treatment group will have similar numbers of male and female
      volunteers. After the last subject for each cohort has completed the day 3 clinical
      assessment and no stopping rules have been met according to Safety Review Board decision, the
      next cohort will commence.

    <description>Css (plasma steady state concentration), Cmax (observed peak plasma concentration), tmax (time of observed peak), AUC0-t (area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable timepoint), AUC0-∞ (area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to infinity), λz (terminal [or elimination rate] phase rate constant), t½ (terminal half-life), CL (plasma clearance) and Vss (volume of distribution at steady state) will be determined for MTP-131. Ae (amount excreted in the urine) and CLr (renal clearance) may also be evaluated.</description>
