    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 10 in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) was used to collect HAMA data. The HAMA consisted of 14 items that assessed the severity of anxiety. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The HAMA Total Score could have ranged from 0 to 56 and higher scores indicated a greater degree of symptom severity. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 10 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS was a participant-rated questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/school (Item 1), social life/leisure activities (Item 2), and family/home management (Item 3). Each item was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). The SDS Global Functional Impairment Score (SDS Global Score) was the sum of the 3 items and could have ranged from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Higher values indicated a higher functional impairment in the participant's work/social/family life. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 10 in Brief Pain Inventory-Modified Short Form (BPI-SF) Pain Severity and Interference Subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF Pain Severity Subscale was a participant-rated questionnaire that measured the severity of pain. Severity scores could have ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) for questions assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in the past 24 hours, and pain right now. The BPI-SF Interference Subscale measured the interference of pain with the participant's ability to function. Interference scores could have ranged from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for questions assessing interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Least squares (LS) means were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study had 3 periods: a screening period (3 to 30 days prior to randomization, no study drug administered), a treatment period (10 weeks), and a taper period (2 weeks). Participants who completed the treatment period were considered to have completed the study. Participant Flow and results, unless specified otherwise, are during treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Duloxetine</title>
          <description>30 to 120 milligrams (mg) administered orally, once daily for 10 weeks. Starting dose, 30-mg capsule, once daily for 2 weeks, with option to increase dose (30-mg increments) at Weeks 2, 4, and 7. If participant's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) Score was ≥3 (minimal improvement, no change, or worse) at Week 2, 4, or 7, the dose was required to be increased by 30 mg. At end of 10-week treatment period, participants had choice to enter 2-week taper period or begin active treatment (duloxetine or other).
Optional taper period: Dosing was dependent on the participant's final dosage during the treatment period. Participants taking duloxetine 120 or 90 mg once daily received duloxetine 60 mg once daily for 1 week followed by 30 mg once daily for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 60 mg once daily received duloxetine 30 mg once daily for 1 week followed by placebo for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 30 mg once daily received placebo for 2 weeks.</description>

If participant's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) Score was ≥3 (minimal improvement, no change, or worse) at Week 2, 4, or 7, the dose was required to be increased by 30 mg. At end of 10-week treatment period, participants had choice to enter 2-week taper period or begin active treatment (duloxetine or other).
Optional taper period: Dosing was dependent on the participant's final dosage during the treatment period. Participants taking duloxetine 120 or 90 mg once daily received duloxetine 60 mg once daily for 1 week followed by 30 mg once daily for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 60 mg once daily received duloxetine 30 mg once daily for 1 week followed by placebo for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 30 mg once daily received placebo for 2 weeks.</description>

          <title>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) Total Score</title>
          <description>The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) was used to collect HAMA data. The HAMA Total Score consisted of 14 items that assessed the severity of anxiety. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The HAMA Total Score could have ranged from 0 to 56 and higher scores indicated a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

          <title>Years Since Onset of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</title>
          <description>GAD was defined as excessive anxiety and worry, present more days than not, for at least 6 months, in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revised (DSM-IV TR). The excessive anxiety and worry must have been difficult to control and must have caused significant distress or impairment in normal functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 10 in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) was used to collect HAMA data. The HAMA consisted of 14 items that assessed the severity of anxiety. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The HAMA Total Score could have ranged from 0 to 56 and higher scores indicated a greater degree of symptom severity. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

If participant's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) Score was ≥3 (minimal improvement, no change, or worse) at Week 2, 4, or 7, the dose was required to be increased by 30 mg. At end of 10-week treatment period, participants had choice to enter 2-week taper period or begin active treatment (duloxetine or other).
Optional taper period: Dosing was dependent on the participant's final dosage during the treatment period. Participants taking duloxetine 120 or 90 mg once daily received duloxetine 60 mg once daily for 1 week followed by 30 mg once daily for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 60 mg once daily received duloxetine 30 mg once daily for 1 week followed by placebo for 1 week.

        <description>The SDS was a participant-rated questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/school (Item 1), social life/leisure activities (Item 2), and family/home management (Item 3). Each item was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). The SDS Global Functional Impairment Score (SDS Global Score) was the sum of the 3 items and could have ranged from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Higher values indicated a higher functional impairment in the participant's work/social/family life. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <description>HADS was a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales (anxiety and depression). Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0 to 3) and higher scores indicated a greater dysfunction. The HADS Anxiety Subscale Score was the sum of the odd numbered items and scores could have ranged from 0 to 21. The HADS Depression Subscale Score was the sum of the even numbered items and scores could have ranged from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicated a greater dysfunction. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

Starting dose, 30-mg capsule, once daily for 2 weeks, with option to increase dose (30-mg increments) at Weeks 2, 4, and 7. If participant's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) Score was ≥3 (minimal improvement, no change, or worse) at Week 2, 4, or 7, the dose was required to be increased by 30 mg. At end of 10-week treatment period, participants had choice to enter 2-week taper period or begin active treatment (duloxetine or other).
Optional taper period: Dosing was dependent on the participant's final dosage during the treatment period. Participants taking duloxetine 120 or 90 mg once daily received duloxetine 60 mg once daily for 1 week followed by 30 mg once daily for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 60 mg once daily received duloxetine 30 mg once daily for 1 week followed by placebo for 1 week.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 10 in Brief Pain Inventory-Modified Short Form (BPI-SF) Pain Severity and Interference Subscales</title>
        <description>The BPI-SF Pain Severity Subscale was a participant-rated questionnaire that measured the severity of pain. Severity scores could have ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) for questions assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in the past 24 hours, and pain right now. The BPI-SF Interference Subscale measured the interference of pain with the participant's ability to function. Interference scores could have ranged from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for questions assessing interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Least squares (LS) means were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

            <title>Duloxetine</title>
            <description>30 to 120 milligrams (mg) administered orally, once daily for 10 weeks. Starting dose, 30-mg capsule, once daily for 2 weeks, with option to increase dose (30-mg increments) at Weeks 2, 4, and 7. If participant's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) Score was ≥3 (minimal improvement, no change, or worse) at Week 2, 4, or 7, the dose was required to be increased by 30 mg. At end of 10-week treatment period, participants had choice to enter 2-week taper period or begin active treatment (duloxetine or other).
Optional taper period: Dosing was dependent on the participant's final dosage during the treatment period. Participants taking duloxetine 120 or 90 mg once daily received duloxetine 60 mg once daily for 1 week followed by 30 mg once daily for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 60 mg once daily received duloxetine 30 mg once daily for 1 week followed by placebo for 1 week. Participants taking duloxetine 30 mg once daily received placebo for 2 weeks.</description>

        <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF was a participant-rated questionnaire designed to assess the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced during the past week. The questionnaire consisted of 16 items rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The total raw score was the sum of Items 1 to 14 and could have ranged from 14 to 70. Total raw scores were converted to, and expressed as, the percentage of the maximum possible score. Percent=100*(total raw score – 14)/56. Higher scores indicated higher levels of enjoyment/satisfaction. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, and baseline.</description>

        <description>The SDS was a participant-rated questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/school (Item 1), social life/leisure activities (Item 2), and family/home management (Item 3). Each item was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). Higher values indicated a higher functional impairment in the participant's work/social/family life. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 10 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Work/School, Social Life, and Family/Home Management Individual Impairment Scores</title>
          <description>The SDS was a participant-rated questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/school (Item 1), social life/leisure activities (Item 2), and family/home management (Item 3). Each item was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). Higher values indicated a higher functional impairment in the participant's work/social/family life. Least squares (LS) mean were calculated and analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment-by-visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

Two definitions were used to determine remission: Definition 1 (HAMA Total Score ≤7 at endpoint) and Definition 2 (HAMA Total Score ≤10 at endpoint). The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) was used to collect HAMA data. The HAMA consisted of 14 items that assessed the severity of anxiety. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The HAMA Total Score could have ranged from 0 to 56 and higher scores indicated a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Improvement (Sustained Improvement Rate)</title>
        <description>Two definitions, using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) Total Score at endpoint compared with baseline, were used to determine sustained improvement: Definition 1 [sustained improvement overall required a ≥30% improvement (reduction) in the HAMA Total Score at treatment period endpoint, at an earlier visit prior to endpoint, and at all visits in between] and Definition 2 (sustained improvement from Week 2 required a ≥30% reduction at treatment period endpoint, at Week 2, and at all visits in between). Both definitions required at least 2 post-baseline visits. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) was used to collect HAMA data. The HAMA consisted of 14 items that assessed the severity of anxiety. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The HAMA Total Score could have ranged from 0 to 56 and higher scores indicated a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

Starting dose, 30-mg capsule, once daily for 2 weeks, with option to increase dose (30-mg increments) at Weeks 2, 4, and 7. If participant's Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) Score was ≥3 (minimal improvement, no change, or worse) at Week 2, 4, or 7, the dose was required to be increased by 30 mg. At end of 10-week treatment period, participants had choice to enter 2-week taper period or begin active treatment (duloxetine or other).
Optional taper period: Dosing was dependent on the participant's final dosage during the treatment period. Participants taking duloxetine 120 or 90 mg once daily received duloxetine 60 mg once daily for 1 week followed by 30 mg once daily for 1 week.

        <description>The time (days) to first response, defined as a ≥50% improvement (reduction) from baseline in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) Total Score. Participants who did not have a response were censored at the last treatment period visit. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) was used to collect HAMA data. The HAMA consisted of 14 items that assessed the severity of anxiety. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe).

Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The HAMA Total Score could have ranged from 0 to 56 and higher scores indicated a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

        <description>Time (days) to first functional remission. Two definitions, using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Score (SDS Global Score), were used to determine functional remission: Definition 1 (SDS Global Score ≤5 at endpoint) and Definition 2 (SDS Global Score ≤6 at endpoint). Participants, who did not have an SDS Global Score ≤5 or ≤6, were censored at the last treatment period visit. The SDS was a participant-rated questionnaire used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/school (Item 1), social life/leisure activities (Item 2), and family/home management (Item 3). Each item was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). The SDS Global Score was the sum of the 3 items and could have ranged from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Higher values indicated a higher functional impairment in the participant's work/social/family life.</description>
