  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to find out the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib
      (VELCADE) in combination with pralatrexate in patients with previously treated multiple
      myeloma, AL amyloid and Waldenstroem's macroglobulinemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I dose-escalation safety study of VELCADE in combination with
      pralatrexate in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. In a standard 3+3 dose
      escalation trial design, escalating doses of pralatrexate in combination with VELCADE will be
      studied sequentially, with at least 3 patients in each dose level until the MTD is
      determined. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD are determined during cycle 1 of treatment.

             response reached after previous therapy.

          -  Refractory myeloma is defined as failure to achieve at least a minor response (patient
             achieved stable disease as his/her best response) or progression of disease on current
             therapy or within 60 days of last dose of current therapy.

          -  The patient has measurable disease defined as one of the following:
