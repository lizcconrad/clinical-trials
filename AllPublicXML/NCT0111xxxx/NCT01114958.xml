  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study proposes the use of systemic thiosulfate rescue to allow supradose
      intra-arterial cisplatin delivery to lung tumors. Eligible patients would be those with at
      least one lung lesion large enough of characterize angiographically. All patients will first
      undergo a CT arteriogram of the target tumor. Patients will then receive 2 treatments on 2
      consecutive weeks. The primary endpoint will be toxicity, with secondary endpoint of response
      as measured on week 4. This pilot study will also determine how technically feasible it is to
      locate the blood supply to these tumors and deliver cisplatin.

      If the first 6 patients do well, 6 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 12.

    <description>Cisplatin (150 mg/m^2) is given as an intra-arterial bolus, once, on days 2 and 9 of treatment. Thiosulfate (9 g/m^2), is given concurrently with cisplatin as an intravenous push over 15-20 minutes followed by a 6-hour intravenous infusion of thiosulfate (12 g/m^2).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary lung cancer (any type) or dominant lung metastases from other primary cancers.

          -  Patients must have either measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 70%.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  3 week elapse from previous cytotoxic therapy (except for erlotinib or hormonal
             therapy, which can be ongoing) with side effects improved to grade 2 or less, and no
             prior radiotherapy to the lung.

          -  Adequate organ function.

          -  Treated brain metastases, if present, with toxicities improved to grade 2 or less.

          -  Willingness and ability to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation to the largest lesion in the lung.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to practice contraception.

          -  Renal insufficiency.

          -  Comorbidities of grade 3 or greater.

          -  Concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions as defined by the treating physician
             which would preclude safe performance of study procedures or compromise the ability of
             the patient to consent to study.
