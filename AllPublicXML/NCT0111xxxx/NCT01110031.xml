  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ofatumumab is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that exhibits high binding affinity to an
      antigen on the surface of B lymphocytes. Antigen engagement by ofatumumab results in maximal
      B-cell killing through complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antigen-dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity in both antigen high- and low-expressing cells. Recent research has shown that
      ofatumumab-dependent B-cell depletion provides clinical benefit to subjects with
      CD20-positive cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The purpose of the current
      study is to assess the impact of ofatumumab on electrocardiographic parameters with
      particular focus on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval duration) in subjects with
      refractory CLL. Subjects enrolled in this open-label, single-arm trial will receive
      ofatumumab at the highest clinical dose (2000 mg) studied or planned for study. Ofatumumab
      will be administered as eight weekly intravenous (IV) infusions followed by four monthly
      infusions, beginning in Week 13, across a 25-week treatment period. Cardiovascular effects
      will be evaluated during treatment through routine 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG)
      monitoring. The pharmacokinetic relationship between plasma concentration of ofatumumab and
      its effect on QTc interval duration will be examined. Specifically, ECG assessments will be
      collected in triplicate at baseline, at the time of maximum ofatumumab concentrations
      periodically on-therapy, and at the end of treatment. After completion of the final
      ofatumumab infusion, subjects will continue to be followed for safety and efficacy for six
      months relative to the last ofatumumab dose.
