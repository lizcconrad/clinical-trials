    <textblock>
      The initial hypothesis is that branched-chain aminoacids (BCAA) administration could be
      beneficial to patients suffering from sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), the aim of the present work
      is to verify this hypothesis.

      The literature data demonstrate that a BCAA complementation improves the physical
      performances, protects lean mass and increases VO2 max during training.

      We demonstrated earlier that this complementation can cure at less partly the hypoxemia of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary patients by a stimulation of respiratory centres.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The principal criterion of BCAA efficacy is based on the depth of arterial desaturation during sleep, assessed by the level of SaO2 during the validated sleep time measured during the polysomnography performed at the end of the study.</measure>
