    <textblock>
      Currently there is a lot of literatures on stroke rehabilitation and post-discharge therapy.
      However, there are few evidence based guidelines on patient engagement after stroke in the
      post-rehabilitation community phase. There is evidence from stroke studies that stroke
      patients with mild to moderate disability, discharged early from an acute hospital unit can
      be rehabilitated in the community by an interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team and
      attain similar functional outcomes when compared to patients receiving in-patient
      rehabilitation. There is strong evidence that additional hospital based outpatient therapy
      improves short term functional outcomes compared to routine care over short term. Although
      meta-analyses have examined the efficacy of self management education programs, the
      interpretation of such reviews is limited by heterogeneity in populations and interventions
      and the limited range of outcomes measured. Few randomized controlled trials have found a
      reduction in health service utilization, such as incidences of hospitalization (in patients
      with chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke and arthritis) as a direct outcome of
      attending an education program. For self-management support to be effective and sustainable
      in the community, it is postulated that initiatives simultaneously focus on supporting
      patients to engage in self management and equipping health care professionals with the
      necessary resources to assist them.

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study of a post discharge community based patient
      engagement program for stroke patients discharged with a new carer after a period of
      in-hospital rehabilitation. Potential cases are identified within 2 weeks after admission
      into rehabilitation wards and randomized into either intervention group or usual care
      (control) group. Patients undergo the usual pre-discharge planning while in ward with
      predischarge assessment carried out by an independent (blinded) assessor. The control group
      are referred to receive the usual post-discharge community and rehabilitation backup. The
      intervention group has access to a special telephone hotline, home visits by team member
      within 1 week after discharge, patient diary to record home monitoring and back up of a
      specialist lead patient engagement clinic located in Kowloon Hospital. After 12 weeks,
      another home visit will be arranged for a repeat assessment by an independent (blinded)
      assessor. The outcomes to be measured include service parameters such as unplanned medical
      readmissions, AED attendances, length of stay at acute and rehabilitation units. Patient
      related parameters such as mortality, institutionalization, functional outcomes, mood,
      quality of life and complications will be measured as well as a carer strain and satisfaction
      survey.
