      Project: An analysis of Diabetes Control in Puerto Rico Hypothesis: This project seeks to
      determine the causes for: i) poor adherence to prescribed treatment by patients, ii) low
      compliance by providers with national guidelines iii) barriers impose by health insurance in
      control of diabetes mellitus iv) effectiveness of a disease management program for treatment
      adherence by patients.

      Method (s) The study will consist of three phases:

      i) assessment phase,

      ii) multimedia health education campaign for patients, providers and local health insurances
      for adherence improvement

      iii) reassessment phase.

      Target Population:

      Phase I: 600 Hispanic, male and female, residents of Puerto Rico with a diagnosis of type 1
      and 2 diabetes mellitus older than 18 of age.

      Phase II: 600 patients identified in phase I with individualize health education
      interventions on the importance of adherence to prescribed medical treatment. 2) Spanish
      speaking population of Puerto Rico, health service providers, and health insurance companies
      through a multimedia health education campaign.

      Phase III: reassessment of the 600 patients of Phase I.

      Data Collection Tools:

      i) Demographic information will be obtained by an interview questionnaire. Patients will be
      assigned a control number automatically by the data system.

      ii) Laboratory blood samples for A1C, lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL
      cholesterol), and serum creatinine.

      iii) A comprehensive educational adherence program with different media strategies such as:
      radio spots, newspaper articles, public service announcements, telemedicine services.

      Data Analysis: Data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows.

    <description>Outcome measure assessment: Descriptive analysis will be computed to describe the demographic and health services characteristic of the participants.
Bivariate analysis using contingency tables and the Pearson Chi-square test and independent samples t-tests will be conducted to determine whether or not there were differences between adults with diabetes and A1C levels lower than 7% and those with A1C levels greater than 7% in term of demographics, health services characteristics, health insurance type, type of providers, type of medication (insulin or pills) and comorbidities. For statistical analysis, alpha will be set at p &lt; 0.05.</description>
