  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decisions about the use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections are the most
      frequently reported reason for consulting a family physician. Although it varies according to
      the specific type of acute respiratory infections, the use of antibiotics is estimated to be
      63% to 67%, well above the expected prevalence of bacterial infections thus suggesting
      overuse of antibiotics. Consequently, there is an urgent need for helping family physicians
      and their patients to improve the clinical decision making process regarding the use of
      antibiotics for acute respiratory infections. We will evaluate the impact of DECISION +, a
      multifaceted intervention program that includes training in shared decision making, reminders
      and feedback targeting physicians, and decision support tools targeting patients on the
      decision to use antibiotics for acute respiratory infections. Results from this study will
      lay the ground for a national strategy targeting the improvement of the clinical decision
      making process regarding antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in primary care. In
      turn, this will increase quality of care and patient safety.

    <time_frame>After index consultation</time_frame>
    <description>After an index consultation, we will ask patients: &quot;Was a prescription for an antibiotic or a sample of antibiotic provided to treat an ARI (acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, or acute rhinosinusitis)?&quot; Possible answers will be:
Yes,(Immediate antibiotics);
Yes,(Delayed antibiotics);
No (no antibiotics).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>After index consultation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) after the index consultation. This questionnaire is similar for physicians and patients and includes 19 items, on a five-point Likert scale, divided into five subscales that are i)uncertainty and its modifiable deficits: ii) knowledge, iii) values clarification, iv) support and v) perception of an effective choice. Both the physician and patient versions of the DCS have adequate psychometric properties and have the same meaning for both physicians and patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the decision that was made</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after the index consultation</time_frame>
    <description>2 weeks after the index consultation, patients will be asked via a telephone interview: &quot;What was the decision made with the FP about antibiotic use for ARI two weeks ago?&quot; and &quot;Have you complied with this decision?&quot; (yes or no). If patients answer &quot;no&quot;, research assistants, using an open-ended question, will inquire about the reasons and the options that were adhered to. Interviewers will be unaware of the study group and will be instructed not to ask questions that could reveal the study group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional regret</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after the index consultation</time_frame>
    <description>2 weeks after the index consultation, decisional regret will be assessed in patients using the Decisional Regret Scale (DRS) via a telephone interview. The DRS is a 5-item scale with adequate psychometric properties that correlates strongly with decision satisfaction and overall QOL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks after the index consultation</time_frame>
    <description>For patients only, before and two weeks after the index consultation (via a telephone interview), QOL will be assessed using the Short Form-12 (SF-12V2 Health survey). This questionnaire measures general health status from the patient's point of view and includes eight concepts commonly represented in health status: physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and emotional and mental health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to engage in SDM in future consultations dealing with antibiotic use for ARI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks after the index consultation</time_frame>
    <description>In FP and their patients, this intention will be assessed based on the Theory of planned behavior (TPB). The questionnaire includes 15 items, on a 7-point Likert scale, that cover the constructs of the TPB, namely attitudes, social norm, perceived behavioral control and intention. Patients will complete this questionnaire before and 2 weeks after the index consultation; physicians will complete it once during the baseline data collection period and after the last encounter of the post-intervention data collection period.</description>
