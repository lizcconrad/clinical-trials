  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accordingly, the new update of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines 2006 is
      based on the control of the disease and attempts to quantify and graduate the level of
      control by using a classification of asthmatic subjects into controlled,partly controlled and
      uncontrolled groups.

      Achieving and maintaining optimal asthma control is a major goal of asthma management.
      Although the results of clinical trials advocate that asthma control can be reached in most
      patients, there is evidence that many subjects with asthma have poorly controlled disease and
      that there is a significant gap between the treatment goals and the current level of asthma
      control achieved in the general population.

      The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of uncontrolled and partly controlled
      asthma in Italy using a patient-based tool such as Asthma Control Test.
