    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and can cause pain, swelling, and
      reduced motion in the joints, which as a result can impact quality of life. It can occur in
      any joint, but usually affects the hands, knees, hips or spine. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the efficacy and safety of a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
      gel formulation in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Subjects with OA of the knee who complete a washout of all pain medication will be randomized
      to either a topical NSAID gel formulation (active study drug) or placebo. Study drug or
      placebo will be applied twice a day to the osteoarthritic knee during a 4-week treatment
      period. Subjects will receive acetaminophen for rescue medication as needed to treat pain
      during the treatment period. Subjects will report pain intensity, drug application
      information and use of rescue medication every day and complete the WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index and
      a Patient Global Assessment at clinic visits. Safety assessments include adverse events, skin
      irritation assessments, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations and vital signs.
