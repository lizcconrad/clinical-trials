      This study will focus on the primary objectives:

        -  To estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination among a large cohort of childhood cancer
           survivors and an acquaintance control group.

        -  To describe the difference in HPV vaccination rate and HPV vaccination intent among
           preadolescent/adolescent females surviving childhood cancer and an acquaintance control
           group.

      This study will also focus on the secondary objectives:

        -  To examine sociodemographic, medical, and psychological differences between those who
           have/have not initiated HPV vaccination and between those who do/do not intend to get
           vaccinated in the future.

        -  To assess the general predictive influence of sociodemographic, medical, and
           psychological variables on HPV vaccination and intent among mothers with
           preadolescent/adolescent daughters.

    <textblock>
      Effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common
      sexually transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, the second most common
      cancer among women worldwide. HPV vaccine uptake is particularly important for females
      surviving childhood cancer, many of whom are at high risk for HPV complications due to the
      direct and indirect effects of cancer treatment. Thus, Version 3.0 of the Children's Oncology
      Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult
      Cancer has recently recommended HPV vaccination for all eligible females surviving childhood
      cancer. Because this vaccine was only FDA approved in 2006, little is known about the
      complexity of vaccination uptake among those surviving cancer, and how the factors
      influencing vaccination decision-making differ among families with and without a history of
      pediatric cancer.

      The purpose of this exploratory study is to estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination and to
      assess predictors of HPV vaccination (and intent) among 9-26 year old females who have
      survived childhood cancer, while making comparisons to healthy acquaintance controls. In a
      cross-sectional design, those surviving childhood cancer (and acquaintance controls) will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire which queries sociodemographic, medical, and psychological
      variables which may relate to HPV vaccination or intent. Current vaccination rates will be
      examined and factors which associate with HPV vaccination (and intent) will be identified.
      Findings of the present study will inform recruitment strategies for future studies examining
      the immunogenicity, safety, tolerability, and behavioral outcomes of HPV vaccination among
      females surviving childhood cancer. More immediately, this work will further our
      understanding of familial decision-making regarding HPV vaccination among female survivors of
      childhood cancer and will determine whether vaccination recruitment models developed for
      healthy adolescents and young adults generalize to the pediatric cancer population.

    <description>Mothers or female primary caregivers ( with daughters aged 9-17) and young adult females aged 18-26 referred for study participation by participants from the ACT clinic. Participants have daughters aged 9-17 years or young adult females aged 18-26 at the time of study enrollment For those acquaintance controls electing to complete the paper-and-pencil questionnaire, the study team will send it to them in the mail along with a pre-addressed, stamped, return envelope. For those electing to complete the on-line questionnaire, the participant's email address will be collected and a secured link to our on-line questionnaire will be sent to them in an email.

        Maternal participants and young adult females (18-26) enrolled from the ACT clinic will
        provide contact information for acquaintances in their communities who have daughters (in
        the young adult arm 18-26 years old peers) roughly the same age as the targeted ACT
        patient. This will obtain a control sample demographically most like the cancer group.
        Typically, this will take the form of having the participants access their cell phones, and
        provide the contact information of the mothers (or 18-26 year old peers) who they identify
        as potential acquaintance controls. This information will then be used as a means to
        contact the potential acquaintance control participants. These participants will be mothers
        with daughters between the ages of 9 and 17 years-of-age or 18-26 year old females.
        Participants aged 18-26 years will now complete self-reported questionnaires as part of
        this survey study.

        Inclusion Criteria- Mothers of ACT patients

          1. Active females patients (aged 18-26 years) or mothers/female primary caregivers of
             minor female patients (aged 9-17 years) in the After Completion of Therapy (ACT)
             clinic at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).

          2. Proficient in reading and writing English.

          3. Cognitively intact such that the study questionnaire can be understood and completed.

          4. Participant is willing and able to provide informed consent according to institutional
             guidelines.

        Inclusion criteria for acquaintance control participants:

        An acquaintance control sample will be comprised of a community sample of adult women (aged
        18-26 years) and mothers with daughters in the 9-17 year age range who are acquainted with
        the ACT patient's family.The primary feature distinguishing the acquaintance controls from
        the SJCRH sample is the presence/nonpresence of personal (for controls aged 18-26) or
        daughter's (for maternal controls) cancer history.

        The following represents the inclusion criteria for acquaintance control participants:

          1. Females (aged 18-26 years) or mothers/female primary caregivers (with daughters aged
             9-17 years) referred for study participation by adult survivors or maternal
             participants from the ACT clinic

          2. Proficient in reading and writing English

          3. Cognitively intact such that the study questionnaire can be understood and completed.

          4. Participant is willing and able to provide informed consent according to institutional
             guidelines.

        According to institutional and NIH policy, the study will approach and consent research
        participants regardless of ethnic background.Institutional experience confirms broad
        representation in this regard.

        Exclusion Criteria for acquaintance control group

        *Personal history of cancer (for controls aged 18-26 years) or history of having a child
        diagnosed with cancer (for maternal controls with daughters aged 9-17 years)

        A supplemental community control sample (meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria
        outlined above) will also be utilized via the subject pool in the Department of Psychology
        at The University of Memphis.
