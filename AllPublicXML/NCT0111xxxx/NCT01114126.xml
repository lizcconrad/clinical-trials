  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Neu-P11,
      following the administration of multiple ascending oral doses (2, 5, 20, 50 mg or matching
      placebo) given nightly over 2 periods of 5 days to male and female subjects with primary
      insomnia. In addition, the study is aimed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Neu-P11
      after 1 and 5 days of administration and to evaluate the hypnotic effects of Neu-P11 as well
      as the effects on mood and memory. The study hypothesis is that Neu-P11 is safe, tolerated
      and have significant sleep promoting effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of four multiple ascending doses of orally administered Neu-P11 will be evaluated
      in a double- blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Following a screening visit, the
      recruited subjects will undergo an inclusion/habituation full night PSG screening recording
      in the sleep clinic to exclude subjects with sleep disorders. Eligible subjects will be
      divided into 2 cohorts of 12 subjects each. Following screening, each cohort will be
      randomised to receive Neu-P11 or placebo for a first period of 5 days and will be crossed
      over following at least 21 days to receive placebo or a higher dose of Neu-P11 for a second
      period of 5 days. Each cohort will receive a different dose of Neu-P11, chosen from 2, 5, 20
      and 50 mg. The starting dose is 5 mg but a smaller dose (2 mg) is also included for the
      purpose of pharmacodynamic evaluation. Before proceeding from 5mg to the next higher dose
      safety will be evaluated based on adverse events, clinical and biological data. Subjects of
      Cohort A will be randomised to dose levels 2 and 3 (doses 5 and 20 mg). Subjects of Cohort B
      will be randomised to dose levels 1 and 4 (doses 2 and 50 mg).
