    <textblock>
      At the present time, scientific consensus exists on obesity multifactorial etiopatogenia. As
      well, professionals and researchers agree that the treatment must approach several scopes,
      such as dietetic, physical activity, pharmacologic and surgical. These two last ones should
      not be the first election and must be reserved for those cases of morbid obesities or in case
      the previous ones have failed. The combination of diet and exercise is still not sufficiently
      studied, in special, the addition of strength training, as we propose in this project, for
      which established intervention protocols do not exist, and that could suppose an additional
      benefit in the reduction of risk factors.

      Therefore, the objectives that we aim in this project are enumerated below:

        -  To discover which are the most effective training protocols and to determine what type
           of exercise combined with nutrition is more appropriate for obesity intervention
           programs.

        -  To establish the relationship between markers related with cardiovascular risk
           (adopokines and lipid profile) and the different intervention protocols proposed.

        -  To describe the influence of nine genetic polymorphisms (selected by their relationship
           with the energy expense and the physical yield) on the effect of different training
           protocols.

        -  To determine how important is body composition (fat mass and muscle mass mainly) in
           total daily energy expenditure.

        -  To establish rules of nutritional and exercise intervention that can be applied in
           public and private training centers. If the proposed objectives are fulfilled, this
           would contribute to an improvement in patients health in long term, along with an
           enormous saving in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to propose
           new lines of intervention in overweight and obese adults that, until now, little have
           been investigated. This way, resistance training is proposed in combination with
           cardiovascular training and endocrinologic treatment. It fits to emphasize that, as far
           as we know, it is the first project of these characteristics, that puts in touch the
           public and private sector (hospitals, universities and fitness area), to establish
           standardized relations protocols to allow a close pursuit of obese patients.
