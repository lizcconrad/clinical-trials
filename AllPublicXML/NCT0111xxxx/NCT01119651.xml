  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of Tazarotene Foam to induce a
      photoallergic reaction when exposed to UV and VIS light on skin of healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam 0.1% to induce a photoallergic reaction in healthy
      adult volunteers. Approximately 62 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65
      years will be enrolled.

      All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam, vehicle foam, and no foam
      (blank; negative control). Inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema and local skin
      reactions) or superficial effects at patch sites will be visually assessed to corresponding
      grading scales. The study duration will be 6 weeks or 9 weeks and will consist of the
      following phases: Screening, 3 week Induction, 2 week Rest, and 1 week Challenge, and if
      indicated, a second 2 week Rest and 1 week Repeat Challenge.

    <description>There are 2 phases in this study. The induction phase will include 6 days of patch application to the subject's back. Patches will be removed daily and irradiated. Patch applications will be placed on the same sites, unless a strong reaction is observed. The induction phase will be followed by a rest period followed by the Challenge Phase which consists of a 24-hr application of 3 sets of 3 patches (Set C, Set D, and Set E) applied to na√Øve sites on the subject's back. Each set of patches will consist of a tazarotene foam patch, a vehicle foam patch, and a blank patch. After 24 hrs, Set D patch sites will be evaluated and irradiated with UVA/UVB light. Set C patch sites will be evaluated and irradiated with UVA, UVB light and visible light. Set E patch sites will be evaluated &amp; will serve as nonirradiated controls. Patch sites will be evaluated 1 hr after patch removal and during follow up visits at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, and 72 hrs after removal of the final patch in Set E.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
             authorization before any protocol-specific procedures are performed.

          -  Male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.

          -  Able and willing to complete the study and to comply with all study instructions.

          -  Possess Fitzpatrick skin types I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns
             easily; tans minimally), or III (burns moderately; tans gradually) that will not
             interfere with the evaluation of any skin responses (Fitzpatrick 1988). Determination
             of skin types will be based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects'
             opinions of their responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.

          -  Male subjects and their partners must agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception.

        Additional criteria for women of childbearing potential, defined as one who is biologically
        capable of becoming pregnant, including perimenopausal women who are less than 2 years from
        their last menses:

          -  A regular menstrual cycle before study entry (as reported by the subject).

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks of the first application of study
             product.

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the duration of
             the study. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth
                  vaginally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermicide is acceptable.

        Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable method
        of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          -  Considered unable or unlikely to attend the necessary visits.

          -  Clinically significant skin diseases that may contraindicate participation or
             interfere with patch test site evaluations, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic
             dermatitis, acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin
             cancer.

          -  A history of severe reactions from exposure to sunlight, including previous experience
