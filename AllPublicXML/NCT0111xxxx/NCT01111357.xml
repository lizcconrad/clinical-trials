  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affects between 0.3% and 1.0% of the population, it can lead to
      progressive joint destruction and severe disability. To date, two RA genetic susceptibility
      factors have been identified: HLA-DRB1-SE (Shared epitope) and PTPN22 620W alleles. The
      predictive value of the alleles for diagnosis of RA was previously investigated in cohorts of
      caucasians patients with early unclassified arthritis that showed restrained association
      between RA and HLA-SE. Despite the contribution of HLA to the overall genetic risk has been
      estimated to range from 30% to 50%, it has never been studied in the French west-Indian
      population.
