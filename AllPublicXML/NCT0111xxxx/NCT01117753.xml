  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent substance abuse results in significant negative outcomes and extraordinary costs
      for youths, their families, communities, and society. Moreover, rates of psychiatric
      comorbidity among substance abusing youth range from 25% up to 82%, and youths with a dual
      diagnosis are more than twice as costly to treat compared to those with no comorbidity. The
      applicant principal investigator recently completed a pilot project funded by the National
      Institute on Drug Abuse focused on developing and piloting a psychosocial treatment
      specifically for youth presenting for outpatient treatment with co-occurring substance use
      and internalizing (i.e., mood and/or anxiety) problems. Results were promising with the
      experimental group exhibiting significantly less substance use and more rapid reductions in
      anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to the control group. The proposed research is a
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the experimental treatment (OutPatient Treatment
      for Adolescents; OPT-A) to an &quot;active placebo&quot; on key clinical indices from pre-treatment
      through 18 months. The proposed RCT (n = 160) employs the treatment manual, quality assurance
      protocol, and therapist training protocol developed and successfully tested in the pilot
      study, to evaluate the efficacy of OPT-A for youth referred to outpatient treatment of
      co-occurring substance use and internalizing problems. The following outcomes will be
      evaluated: drug use; mental health; behavioral, school, peer, and family functioning; and
      consumer satisfaction. The intervention addresses one of the more prevalent and most
      challenging, costly, and understudied presenting problems among adolescent outpatients. If
      successful, this research could provide a considerable contribution in the treatment field
      for youth with co-occurring substance use and internalizing disorders.
