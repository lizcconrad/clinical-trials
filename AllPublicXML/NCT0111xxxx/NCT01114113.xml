  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid diarrhea that patients experience who have diarrhea occurring after eating specific
      foods may be causing a &quot;physiologic gastric dumping syndrome&quot;. This means that rather than
      the food being kept in the stomach for normal digestion, it rapidly goes into the small
      intestine and diarrhea occurs. This study is designed to measure how fast the food empties
      from the stomach when a person with this problem consumes a &quot;regular diet&quot;, compared to a
      meal with a &quot;triggering substance&quot;. Each participant will swallow a radio frequency capsule
      that with the different meals that will show how fast the food is traveling through the
      intestines in the different situations.

      Since some patients have found that pancreatic enzymes seem to ameliorate this diarrhea from
      occurring,willing participants will be asked to duplicate the &quot;triggering meal&quot; 2 more times.
      Once taking a pancreatic enzyme (active drug) with the meal and a second time taking an
      identical placebo. Neither the participant nor the study investigator will know which capsule
      is the active drug in this phase of the study. Willing participants will receive a small
      stipend each time they swallow the radio frequency capsule. This capsule is large,
      approximately twice the size of a vitamin pill so individuals must have no difficulties with
      swallow to participate nor any history of bowel obstruction or major surgery to the abdominal
      which might have caused adhesions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have been diagnosed as having post prandial diarrhea for at least 5
             years by his/her primary care physician or gastroenterologist and is believed to have
             no other medical condition that would cause this medical problem. Each person must be
             over 18 years old and have negative testing for Celiac Disease, a normal colonoscopy
             within 5 years of enrollment, and a normal Hgb and sedimentation rate within 6 months
             of enrollment in the trial.

          2. The patient has provided documented written informed consent/authorization prior to
             initiation of any study-related procedure.

          3. In addition, each patient must report experiencing the onset of urgent defecation
             within 1 hours of eating a specific trigger which is reproducible at least 90% of the
             time when consume.

          4. The patient must be willing to comply with all of the study protocol.

             completely evaluated by a physician. If rectal bleeding has occurred, and the patient
             wants to be considered for the study, the diagnostic workup must have clearly
             identified the etiology for the bleeding and excluded the medical conditions listed
             under 3 below. The patient must be willing to allow the Study team to obtain these
             records for verification of the diagnosis.

          2. The patient has nocturnal bowel movements.

          3. The patient has been diagnosed with or has a family history of any of the following:
             ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, celiac disease, sprue, other inflammatory bowel
             disease or has a positive test for celiac disease on screening lab and has not had a
             full investigation performed to exclude celiac disease.

          4. The patient has had unexplained anorexia or weight loss of more than 10% of body
             weight within 12 months of onset of study.

             past is allowed, but patients must be off either of the medication for at least 1 week
             or until the patient's symptoms of post prandial diarrhea returns before participating
             in the study.

          8. Use of implanted or ambulatory electromechanical medical devices such as pacemakers,
             insulin pumps, and infusion pumps.

          9. History of gastroparesis or chronic use of reglan.
