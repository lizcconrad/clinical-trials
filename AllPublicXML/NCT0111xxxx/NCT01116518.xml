      The purpose of the investigators study is to compare the effect of: 1) physiotherapy 2)
      arthroscopic acromioplasty and debridement or 3) arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction and
      acromioplasty in the treatment of degenerative, atraumatic rotator cuff rupture.

      The study will be conducted according to the revised Declaration of Helsinki by The World
      Medical Association and the ICH-guidelines for good clinical trial practice. The study will
      be submitted for approval to the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of
      Varsinais-Suomi, Finland. A written informed consent will be obtained from each patient.

      This study will be conducted at three different hospitals i.e. Turku University Hospital,
      Tampere University Hospital (Hatanpää hospital) and Kuopio University Hospital as a
      multicenter study. A total of 180 patients, 60 patients at each hospital, will be included in
      this study. The patients are clinically examined and a routine x-ray and MRI-investigation
      are performed. Patients must have an atraumatic degenerative supraspinatus tendon rupture
      comprising less than 2/3 of the tendon insertion, i.e. 1/3 of the tendon insertion must be
      intact. The rupture must be documented by MRI investigation. Patients must be willing and
      give a written informed consent. After recruitment the patients are randomized in one of
      three studied treatment modalities. The randomization is made after clinical and MRI
      investigation by neutral attendant using sealed envelopes. 60 identical envelopes (20 per
      group) are made in each center.

      The Constant score is used as a primary outcome measure. The Constant score is measured from
      each patient right before treatment intervention and at three and six months, one, two and
      five years after the intervention. The intervention groups are designed in a cumulative
      fashion: structured and standardized physiotherapy treatment proceeds gradually in all
      patients (groups 1,2,3), in addition to physiotherapy patients in group 2 are treated with
      acromioplasty, and patients in group 3 with acromioplasty and rotator cuff reconstruction.
