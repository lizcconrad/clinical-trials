  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunction of autonomic nervous system is an important non motor feature of Parkinson'
      disease (PD). Lewy body formation is widely distributed in hypothalamus and in sympathetic
      and parasympathetic systems. Animal studies suggest a link between hypothalamus sensing of
      substrates and glucose metabolism. Thus, hypothalamus lesions could lead to change in glucose
      metabolism. Recently, we showed that fasting blood glucose level was significantly higher in
      PD patients than in control group suggesting that glucose tolerance may be impaired in PD.
      Some studies provided evidence for higher diabetes prevalence in PD patients whereas others
      showed no difference or a reduced risk of diabetes prevalence in PD patients compared to
      healthy subjects.

      So, the risk that a PD patient develops a glucose intolerance or a diabetes is not clearly
      established and merit to be studied considering the damageable consequences for patient
      healthy.

      The aim of this prospective study was to determine the risk that a PD patient develop a
      glucose intolerance or a diabetes compared to a matched control group, using an oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT).

      50 patients

      Inclusion visit :

        -  Clinical examination/ Interview on health and medical history

        -  Complete UPDRS, MMS

        -  Biologic check up

      Protocol :

      All patients were studied in the postabsorptive state after a 10-h overnight fast.

      On the day of the experiment, patients did not receive their treatment. One catheter was
      inserted for blood sample collections. Patients ingested then 75 g of glucose.

      Blood samples were collected for plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentration analyses at
      T0, T30, T60, T90, T120, T150 and T180. Urinary glucose was researched at T0 and T120.

      In parallel, a dysautonomia evaluation of each patient was made (SCOPA AUT questionnaire,
      Tilt test).
