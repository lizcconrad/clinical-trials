    <measure>Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in Milligrams</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years, 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>MTD of LBH589 in addition to glucocorticoids as treatment for Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) manifestations. MTD in Milligrams (mg), taken by mouth (PO), 3 times per week, for 4 weeks. The oral formulation replaced the IV formulation (which became unavailable) after the first 4 participants were treated. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined by the occurrence of Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 or greater toxicity that is unexpected with transplantation, except for hematological toxicity, where DLT is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;750, and for those participants who were platelet transfusion independent is defined as platelets &lt;10 K.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II: Overall Rate of Response (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Progressive Disease (PD) and Stable Disease (SD). Assessment of GVHD will include the skin, liver and gut. Other possible etiologies of organ disease such as C difficile enterocolitis, viral infection, drug reaction, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, etc., will be excluded by appropriate tests. CR is defined as resolution of GVHD in all evaluable organs with no subsequent additional treatment given for acute GVHD. PR is defined as improvement in ≥ one evaluable organ without deterioration in at least one other. PD is defined as deterioration in at least on evaluable organ. SD is defined as the absence of any difference sufficient to meet minimal criteria for improvement or deterioration in any evaluable organs.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)
             not using an effective method of birth control. WOCBP are defined as sexually mature
             women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time
             in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 24 hrs of receiving the first dose of study
             medication if a pregnancy test was not done pre-transplant. Male patients whose sexual
             partners are WOCBP not using effective birth control

             bacterial or viral infections, patients must be receiving therapy and have no signs of
             progression for 48 hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infection patients must be
             receiving systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progression for 1 week
             prior to enrollment. Progressing infection is defined as hemo-dynamic instability
             attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic
             findings attributable to infections. Persisting fever without other signs of symptoms
             will not be interpreted as progressing infections.

          4. Receipt of other investigational new drugs for GVHD including agents used for GVHD
             prophylaxis within 30 days. The following agents are not considered experimental and

               3. Any history of ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes.

               4. Bradycardia defined as heart rate (HR)&lt; 50 bpm. Patients with pacemakers are
                  eligible if HR &gt;/= 50 bpm.

               5. Patients are excluded if the average of the QT Corrected by the Fridericia
                  Formula (QTcF) is &gt; 470 msec on the screening EKGs.

             inducing torsade de pointes if treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a
             different medication prior to starting study drug.

          9. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors with the exception of tacrolimus, voriconazole
             (or posaconazole), cyclosporine that are required for all GVHD patients to control

         10. Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) before
             transplant.

         11. Patients with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or
