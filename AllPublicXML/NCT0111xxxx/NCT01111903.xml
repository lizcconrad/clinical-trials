    <textblock>
      Stage A: To determine efficacy of lenalidomide as single agent in patients with recurrent
      ovarian cancer in second or third line.

      Stage B: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in combination with
      chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.

      Substudy: To investigate the impact of the lenalidomide on patients' immune system affected
      by cancer and to look for an immunizing marker which could be predictive of the activity of
      the lenalidomide in the solid tumors.
