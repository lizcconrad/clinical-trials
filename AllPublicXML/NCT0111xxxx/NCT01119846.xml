    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 13, 4 and 83 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were randomized in Part A, B and C, respectively. The study was conducted from 05 June 2009 to 19 March 2010 at 8 centers in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The maximum time a participant spent in Part A, B and C of the study was approximately 10, 7 and 7 weeks, respectively including the 28-days period allotted for screening assessments in all parts.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Part A</title>
          <description>In this part (Cohort 1), drug naïve T2DM participants were randomized to receive escalating doses of GSK1292263 25 milligrams (mg), 150 mg and 800 mg in each of 3 periods along with placebo and sitagliptin 100 mg orally in the other 2 periods in fasted condition. These doses were administered to the participants in an ascending sequence irrespective of the randomization order for placebo and sitagliptin. In Part A, study drug was administered 2 hours before the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Part B</title>
          <description>In this part (Cohort 2), after the appropriate washout period, T2DM participants on monotherapy or sub-maximal anti-diabetic medications were randomized to receive a single dose of GSK1292263 800 mg orally in fasted or fed condition. Before participants in Part B were dosed, the safety and tolerability of GSK1292263 800 mg administered in the fasted state to 9 participants in Part A was reviewed to ensure that it was safe to proceed. In Part B, study drug was administered 30 minutes after breakfast and lunch and dinner was approximately 4 and 10 hours after dosing.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P3">
          <title>Part C</title>
          <description>Participants were randomized to 14 days of dosing with 4 dose regimens of GSK1292263 (final doses were: 50 mg twice daily [BID], 150 mg BID, 300 mg BID, and 600 mg once daily) or matching placebo (administered BID) or open-label sitagliptin 100 mg (dosed once daily with the morning dose of GSK1292263). In this part (Cohort 3 and Cohort 4), if Cohort 3 was dosed once daily, participants in Cohort 4 were enrolled to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK1292263 when dosed in a BID regimen and vice versa. For once daily dosing, study drug was administered immediately after breakfast. For BID dosing, study drug was administered immediately after breakfast and immediately after the evening meal, but prior to the 10 hour PK sample.</description>

          <description>In this part (Cohort 2), eligible T2DM participants on mono-therapy or sub-maximal anti-diabetic medications washed off these medications for 1 week and received a single dose of GSK1292263 800 mg orally in fasted or fed condition. Before participants in Part B were dosed, the safety and tolerability of GSK1292263 800 mg administered in the fasted state to 9 participants in Part A was reviewed to ensure that it was safe to proceed. In Part B, study drug was administered 30 minutes (min) after breakfast and lunch and dinner was approximately 4 and 10 hours after dosing.</description>

        <description>The first occurrence of the maximum observed plasma concentration determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. When GSK1292263 was dosed once daily, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14 immediately pre-dose (time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14 and 24 hours post-dose. When GSK1292263 was dosed BID, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14, at immediately pre-morning dose, 1,2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post-morning dose. For once daily and BID dosing regimens on Day 7, blood samples were collected at pre-dose (= post-breakfast), 1, 2, 4 (= pre-lunch), 6, 10 (=immediately post-dinner) and 12 hours. When planned PK sampling results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected.</description>

        <description>The AUC0-10, AUC0-12 and AUC0-24 determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. When GSK1292263 was dosed once daily, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14 immediately pre-dose (time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14 and 24 hours post-dose. When GSK1292263 was dosed BID, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14, at immediately pre-morning dose, 1,2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post-morning dose. For QD and BID dosing regimens on Day 7, blood samples were collected at pre-dose (=post- breakfast), 1, 2, 4 (=pre lunch), 6, 10 (=immediately post-dinner) and 12 hours. When planned PK sampling results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected.</description>

        <title>Part A: Summary of Change From Baseline in Fasted Glucose</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. For lunch and evening meal in Part A, samples were collected just before the meal and at the following times after starting each meal: 0.5, 1, 1.5 (except breakfast in Part B), 2 and 3 hours. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from post-Baseline value. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose and other PD markers were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. For lunch and evening meal in Part A, samples were collected just before the meal and at the following times after starting each meal: 0.5, 1, 1.5 (except breakfast in Part B), 2 and 3 hours. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

          <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose and other PD markers were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

        <title>Part A: Summary of the OGTT Derived Parameters: Disposition Index</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose and other PD markers were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. It was calculated by multiplying insulin glucose index with insulin sensitivity index. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

These doses were administered to the participants in an ascending sequence irrespective of the randomization order for placebo and sitagliptin.

          <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose and other PD markers were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. It was calculated by multiplying insulin glucose index with insulin sensitivity index. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose and other PD markers were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. It was calculated as insulin (30 min) – insulin (0 min)/glucose (30 min) – glucose (0 min). It was calculated as insulin (30 min) – insulin (0 min)/glucose (30 min) – glucose (0 min).

        <description>Blood samples were collected fasting pre-breakfast and pre-morning dose (PD time 0) on Days -1, 13 and 14 and then at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after eating the standardized breakfast meal tolerance test. For lunch (4 hour post-morning dose) samples were collected just before the meal and after starting each meal: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours. For the evening meal (10 hour post-morning dose), BID dosing groups followed the sequence of sampling, food and dosing as for breakfast (PD sample immediately before meal, eat and then dose), then 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours post-dinner. A sample was also collected 24 hours post-dose. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value minus post-Baseline value. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

          <title>Part C: Summary of Change From Baseline in Fasted Glucose</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected fasting pre-breakfast and pre-morning dose (PD time 0) on Days -1, 13 and 14 and then at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after eating the standardized breakfast meal tolerance test. For lunch (4 hour post-morning dose) samples were collected just before the meal and after starting each meal: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours. For the evening meal (10 hour post-morning dose), BID dosing groups followed the sequence of sampling, food and dosing as for breakfast (PD sample immediately before meal, eat and then dose), then 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours post-dinner. A sample was also collected 24 hours post-dose. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value minus post-Baseline value. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

        <title>Part C: Summary of Change From Baseline in Fasted Insulin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected fasting pre-breakfast and pre-morning dose (PD time 0) on Days -1, 13 and 14 and then at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after eating the standardized breakfast meal tolerance test. For lunch (4 hour post-morning dose) samples were collected just before the meal and after starting each meal: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours. For the evening meal (10 hour post-morning dose), BID dosing groups followed the sequence of sampling, food and dosing as for breakfast (PD sample immediately before meal, eat and then dose), then 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours post-dinner. A sample was also collected 24 hours post-dose. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value minus post-Baseline value. The point estimates and corresponding 95% CI for treatment ratios were calculated for treatment comparisons versus placebo.</description>

        <title>Part B: Summary of Change From Baseline in Fasted Glucose</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the determination of glucose were collected at pre-dose on Day 1 of each dosing period and immediately prior to and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 min after administration of the 75 grams glucose drink. For lunch and evening meal in Part A, samples were collected just before the meal and at the following times after starting each meal: 0.5, 1, 1.5 (except breakfast in Part B), 2 and 3 hours. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from post-Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The first occurrence of the maximum observed plasma concentration determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. When GSK1292263 was dosed once daily, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14 immediately pre-dose (time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14 and 24 hours post-dose. When GSK1292263 was dosed BID, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14, at immediately pre-morning dose, 1,2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post-morning dose. For once daily and BID dosing regimens on Day 7, blood samples were collected at pre-dose (= post-breakfast), 1, 2, 4 (= pre-lunch), 6, 10 (= immediately post-dinner) and 12 hours. When planned PK sampling results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected.</description>

In this part (Cohort 3 and Cohort 4), if Cohort 3 was dosed once daily, participants in Cohort 4 were enrolled to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of GSK1292263 when dosed in a BID regimen and vice versa. For once daily dosing, study drug was administered immediately after breakfast. For BID dosing, study drug was administered immediately after breakfast and immediately after the evening meal, but prior to the 10 hour PK sample.</description>

          <title>Part C: Summary of AUC0-24, AUC0-t of GSK1292263 and Sitagliptin When Co-administered</title>
          <description>The AUC0-10, AUC0-12 and AUC0-24 determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. When GSK1292263 was dosed once daily, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14 immediately pre-dose (time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 14 and 24 hours post-dose. When GSK1292263 was dosed BID, blood samples were collected on Days 1, 13 and 14, at immediately pre-morning dose, 1,2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 24 hours post-morning dose. For once daily and BID dosing regimens on Day 7, blood samples were collected at pre-dose (= post- breakfast), 1, 2, 4 (= pre lunch), 6, 10 (= immediately post-dinner) and 12 hours. When planned PK sampling results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected.</description>
