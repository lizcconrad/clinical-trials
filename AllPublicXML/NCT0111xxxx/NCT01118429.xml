    <description>Oxybutynin was prescribed for 12 weeks, in progressively increasing doses throughout treatment. At their first visit, the patients were given 2.5 mg of oxybutynin into be taken once a day in the evening, were instructed to increase the dose to 2.5 mg twice a day from the eighth to the 42nd day, and to contact the doctor if they experienced any side effect. After this period they were seen in a second visit, and the dose was increased to 5 mg twice a day from the 43rd to the end of the 84thday, to when a third visit was scheduled.</description>
