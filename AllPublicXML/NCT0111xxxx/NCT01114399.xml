      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a diet rich in broccoli on cardiovascular
      disease risk using biochemical indicators such as blood lipid profiles, most notably
      cholesterol; markers of inflammation as well as established physiological measurements such
      as Pulse wave velocity (PWV), Augmentation index (AIx) and Ambulatory Blood Pressure
      Measurements (ABPM). Broccoli contains compounds known as glucosinolates which are
      metabolised to isothiocyanates when consumed. The major glucosinolate in broccoli is known as
      glucoraphanin which produces the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. The glucosinolates are thought
      to be the principal component in broccoli that may reduce CVD risk. The investigators will
      use a standard cultivar of broccoli and a cultivar that has enhanced levels of glucosinolates
      ('HG broccoli'). This broccoli has been used in previous intervention studies (e.g.
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00535977). Volunteers will be asked to consume 400g of standard
      broccoli, HG broccoli or peas each week over a 12 week period in a double blinded (for the
      broccoli) parallel study. The volunteers recruited will, according to the Joint British
      Societies (JBS 2) Guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in clinical
      practise, have a 10-20% (mild to moderate) risk of developing cardiovascular disease or
      having a cardiovascular (CV) event in the next 10 years.
