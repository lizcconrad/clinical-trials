    <textblock>
      The ACCLAIM study is testing whether the medication &quot;abatacept&quot; can be of benefit to patients
      with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Although abatacept is an investigational
      medication for MS, it is not a new drug. Abatacept has been approved by the FDA to treat
      rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS is a chronic autoimmune disease in which blood cells that are supposed to protect the body
      from infection mistakenly attack the body's own tissue. In MS, the target of this attack is a
      protein called myelin that coats nerves throughout the body. Damage to this protective layer
      can lead to loss of neurologic function.

      There are a number of treatments available to MS patients. Interferon beta, Copaxone, and
      other drugs can delay the worsening of the disease in some patients. For other patients, more
      aggressive treatment with chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine are
      needed. These drugs attempt to slow the disease by limiting the activity of the entire immune
      system. Because of this, they can often have serious side effects.

      This study evaluates the efficacy of abatacept in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. In
      the first phase of the study, all participants will receive 8 intravenous treatments over a
      period of 24 weeks. Then, if a participant remains eligible, they will enter the second phase
      of the study and will receive another 8 treatments over the following 24 weeks. Two-thirds (2
      out of 3) of participants will receive the study drug abatacept in the first phase, and then
      an inactive form (placebo) of the drug in the second phase. The remaining one-third (1 in 3)
      will get the placebo first, then the study drug in the second phase if they remain eligible.
      Therefore, all participants in the ACCLAIM trial will have the opportunity to receive the
      study drug abatacept if they remain healthy during the study. Participants will be asked to
      return for a follow-up visit 12 weeks after all treatments have been completed.

      Regular appointments scheduled during the trial will be used to monitor participants' health
      and progress in the study. These appointments will include: physical and neurological exams,
      blood tests and motor function assessments. A total of 11 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      procedures are scheduled during the study. The study medication and procedures related to the
      study will be provided at no expense to the participant.

    <measure>Mean Number of New Inflammatory MRI Lesions Per Monthly Scans</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8-24</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of new inflammatory MRI lesions obtained on scans every 4 weeks from Week 8 to Week 24, adjusted for differences between subjects before treatment by subtracting the number of new inflammatory lesions observed from the week -1 MRI scan . An inflammatory lesion is defined as a gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion that shows hyperintensity on postcontrast but no hyperintensity on noncontrast T1 images. A new inflammatory lesion is one that was not present on the previously scheduled MRI scan. If the previously scheduled MRI scan was missing, the scan was compared to the last available MRI.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Progressing on the EDSS Scale by at Least 1 Point</measure>
    <time_frame>Week -1 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is an assessment for severity of multiple sclerosis. The EDSS an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis) in half-point increments. Baseline EDSS score was the lowest score observed at either visit -2 (Wk -5) or visit -1 (Wk -1). EDSS progression is defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the EDSS compared to baseline if the baseline was greater than 1.0, or 1.5 points on EDSS if baseline was less than or equal to 1.0, which persisted for a minimum of 12 weeks or was found on three consecutive EDSS assessments starting at Visit 3 (Wk 8).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week -1 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of multiple sclerosis relapse by year. Annualized relapse rate is calculated by dividing the total number of relapse events in the core phase in each treatment group by the total number of days participants participated in the study during the core phase. This number is then multiplied by 365.25 to get an annualized rate.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in the MSFC Over 24 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week -1 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a three-part, standardized, quantitative assessment instrument to measure severity of multiple sclerosis. The MSFC combines three component measures to create a composite measure. The three component measures of the MSFC include the 1) Time 25-foot Walk (a measure of lower extremity function), 2) 9-hole Peg Test (a measure of upper extremity function), and 3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (a measure of cognitive function). Mean change in MSFC scores from baseline to Week 24 were assessed. Scores from all three components are combined then are converted into a Z-score for analyses, with a range from -1 to 1. A positive score indicates improvement in the severity of multiple sclerosis symptoms while negative scores indicate decline in multiple sclerosis symptoms.</description>

          <title>Baseline Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score</title>
          <description>Baseline MSFC score was the most recent score on or before Randomization. The three component measures of the MSFC include the 1) Time 25-foot Walk (a measure of lower extremity function), 2) 9-hole Peg Test (a measure of upper extremity function), and 3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (a measure of cognitive function). Scores from all three components are combined then are converted into a Z-score for analyses, with a range from -1 to 1. A positive score indicates less severity of multiple sclerosis while negative scores indicate more severe multiple sclerosis symptoms.</description>

        <description>The mean number of new inflammatory MRI lesions obtained on scans every 4 weeks from Week 8 to Week 24, adjusted for differences between subjects before treatment by subtracting the number of new inflammatory lesions observed from the week -1 MRI scan . An inflammatory lesion is defined as a gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion that shows hyperintensity on postcontrast but no hyperintensity on noncontrast T1 images. A new inflammatory lesion is one that was not present on the previously scheduled MRI scan. If the previously scheduled MRI scan was missing, the scan was compared to the last available MRI.</description>

        <title>Mean Number of New Inflammatory Lesions in 8-week Intervals</title>
        <description>The mean number of new inflammatory MRI lesions obtained on scans every 8 weeks from Week 8 to Week 24. An inflammatory lesion is defined as a gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion that shows hyperintensity on postcontrast but no hyperintensity on noncontrast T1 images. A new inflammatory lesion is one that was not present on the previously scheduled MRI scan. If the previously scheduled MRI scan was missing, the scan was compared to the last available MRI.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Progressing on the EDSS Scale by at Least 1 Point</title>
        <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is an assessment for severity of multiple sclerosis. The EDSS an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis) in half-point increments. Baseline EDSS score was the lowest score observed at either visit -2 (Wk -5) or visit -1 (Wk -1). EDSS progression is defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the EDSS compared to baseline if the baseline was greater than 1.0, or 1.5 points on EDSS if baseline was less than or equal to 1.0, which persisted for a minimum of 12 weeks or was found on three consecutive EDSS assessments starting at Visit 3 (Wk 8).</description>

          <title>Annualized Relapse Rate</title>
          <description>The rate of multiple sclerosis relapse by year. Annualized relapse rate is calculated by dividing the total number of relapse events in the core phase in each treatment group by the total number of days participants participated in the study during the core phase. This number is then multiplied by 365.25 to get an annualized rate.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the MSFC Over 24 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a three-part, standardized, quantitative assessment instrument to measure severity of multiple sclerosis. The MSFC combines three component measures to create a composite measure. The three component measures of the MSFC include the 1) Time 25-foot Walk (a measure of lower extremity function), 2) 9-hole Peg Test (a measure of upper extremity function), and 3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (a measure of cognitive function). Mean change in MSFC scores from baseline to Week 24 were assessed. Scores from all three components are combined then are converted into a Z-score for analyses, with a range from -1 to 1. A positive score indicates improvement in the severity of multiple sclerosis symptoms while negative scores indicate decline in multiple sclerosis symptoms.</description>

        <description>The mean number of new inflammatory MRI lesions obtained on scans at Weeks 36 and 52, adjusted for differences between subjects before treatment by subtracting the number of new inflammatory lesions observed from the week 24 MRI scan. An inflammatory lesion is defined as a gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion that shows hyperintensity on postcontrast but no hyperintensity on noncontrast T1 images. A new inflammatory lesion is one that was not present on the previously scheduled MRI scan. If the previously scheduled MRI scan was missing, the scan was compared to the last available MRI.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Progressing on the EDSS Scale by at Least 1 Point</title>
        <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is an assessment for severity of multiple sclerosis. The EDSS an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis) in half-point increments. Extension baseline EDSS score was the most recent non-missing value on or before Week 28. Only participants who scored between a 0 and a 5 at baseline were analyzed for this outcome measure. EDSS progression is defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the EDSS compared to baseline if the baseline was greater than 1.0, or 1.5 points on EDSS if baseline was less than or equal to 1.0, which persisted for a minimum of 12 weeks or was found on three consecutive EDSS assessments starting at Visit 3 (Wk 8).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the MSFC in Extension Phase</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a three-part, standardized, quantitative assessment instrument to measure severity of multiple sclerosis. The MSFC combines three component measures to create a composite measure. The three component measures of the MSFC include the 1) Time 25-foot Walk (a measure of lower extremity function), 2) 9-hole Peg Test (a measure of upper extremity function), and 3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (a measure of cognitive function). Mean change in MSFC scores from Week 24 to Week 52 were assessed. Scores from all three components are combined then are converted into a Z-score for analyses, with a range from -1 to 1. A positive score indicates improvement in the severity of multiple sclerosis symptoms while negative scores indicate decline in multiple sclerosis symptoms.</description>
