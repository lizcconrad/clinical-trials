  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that common objections to P4P relate to potential loss of
      autonomy or concerns about adverse effects on patient care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We seek to establish baseline attitudes about Pay for Performance (P4P) in the OUHSC Dept of
      Anesthesiology and determine what differences exist between faculty, CRNAs and residents. We
      plan to resurvey annually to determine if attitudes change as the department implements a P4P
      program. We hope that by understanding the attitudes of anesthesia care providers, we can
      alleviate their concerns. We hope to account for their concerns as we develop and modify our
      P4P program. We believe that acceptance of the general idea of P4P is important if
      individuals are to maintain job satisfaction.
