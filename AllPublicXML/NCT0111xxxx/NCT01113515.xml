    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of a new gel formulation of
      Esmolol hydrochloride (Galnobax®) for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU). The study
      will compare number and types of adverse events occured, rates of wound closure and
      percentage of wounds closed in Galnobax treated groups versus placebo group.

      This is an interventional, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded, dose comparison,
      phase I/II study of Galnobax® in subjects with diabetic foot ulcers. Additionally the effect
      of dosage and frequency of application will also be studied . The total trial duration per
      subject is 25 weeks which comprises of 1 week for screening, 12 weeks of treatment and 12
      weeks of follow-up.
