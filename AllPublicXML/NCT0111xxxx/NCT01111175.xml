    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who are
      scheduled for medically indicated surgical biopsy or resection of disease will be identified.
      Fresh/frozen tissue will be collected and will undergo comprehensive molecular evaluation
      with NextGen sequencing. TGEN's clonal genomics analyses will be applied in the analysis to
      identify and prioritize the mutated targets. Therapeutic options, based on the genetic
      profile of each patient's tumor, will be discussed and an appropriate molecularly-selected
      agent will be recommended by the Study Investigator(s) (SI) and treating oncologist as
      treatment for the patient.

      This is an open-label, pilot trial. Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent TNBC who
      are scheduled for medically indicated surgical biopsy or resection will be enrolled and
      therapeutic options, based on the genetic profile of each patient's tumor, will be discussed
      with the patient.

      Time-to-progression (TTP) for these patients following the selected therapy is the primary
      objective and will be compared to the TTP(s) for their most recent prior therapy. A 30%
      increase in TTP with the molecularly-targeted agent compared with the TTP on the immediate
      prior therapy will be considered as evidence of clinical benefit from the selected therapy.
      The secondary endpoints are best response to the molecularly-selected therapy, overall
      survival (OS) and genetic mutation evaluation in metastatic (or locally recurrent) TNBC.

      The study is designed to demonstrate that the collection and analysis of these tumor samples
      is feasible.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has metastatic or locally recurrent triple negative breast cancer and is scheduled for
             medically indicated surgical biopsy or resection of disease

          -  Will have measurable or evaluable (nonmeasurable) disease per RECIST v 1.1 (see
             Section 10) present after surgical biopsy/resection. Note: following surgical
             resection, if the tumor sample is found to be inadequate for comprehensive molecular
             analysis, the patient will be deemed ineligible and will be replaced.

          -  Has received at least 1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen for their metastatic or locally
             recurrent TNBC prior to initiating the molecularly-selected therapy. There is no limit
             on the prior therapy for TNBC. Note: We strongly recommend holding of on intervening
             therapy if possible from the time of biopsy to the completion of sequencing so as not
             to change the cancer under the selective pressure of treatment, so that the sequencing
             results are reflective of the current cancer.

          -  Is at least 18 years of age

          -  Has an expected survival of at least 6 months, as estimated by the treating oncologist

          -  Has planned surgical resection (indicated for the medical care of the patient) that
             will yield a minimum fresh/frozen tumor sample of 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm (~300 mg) that
             will be available for molecular profiling analysis.

          -  Is agreeable to having a blood sample (10-20 mL) drawn and analyzed to compare their
             normal genetic profile to that of their tumor sample

          -  Has signed the most recent Patient Informed Consent Form

          -  Has signed a Patient Authorization Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has breast cancer other than metastatic or locally recurrent TNBC. Note: surgical
             resection of the recurrent TNBC will render the patient as &quot;no evidence of disease&quot;
             (NED). NED patients are ineligible and will be replaced.

          -  Has a history of heart disease, other conditions that would prevent treatment with a
             standard chemotherapeutic agent

          -  Has evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement that is progressing or that
             requires radiation, resection or steroid therapy

          -  Has a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including
             serious infection

          -  Is a pregnant or nursing woman

          -  Is unable to comply with requirements of study
