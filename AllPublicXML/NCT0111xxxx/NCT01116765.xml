  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether an oral stimulation program, before the introduction of oral feeding,
      enhances the cardiorespiratory manifestations (episodes of oxygen désaturations, and/or
      apnea- bradycardia), and the oral feeding performance, in preterm infants born between 26 to
      29 weeks of gestation age.

      Preterm infant were randomized into an experimental or an control group. Infants in the
      experimental group receive an oral stimulation program consisting of stimulation of the oral
      structures during 10 consecutive days. Infant in the control group receive no stimulation
      only non nutritive sucking during feeding. Both were administered twice per day, during 20
      minutes, 48 hours after discontinuation of nasal continuous positive air pressure. A long
      term evaluation of oral feeding difficulties and neuromotor development are organized.
