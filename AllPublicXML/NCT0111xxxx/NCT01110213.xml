  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this feasibility study is to determine if a theory-based lifestyle
      intervention consisting of telephone counseling is associated with improvements in physical
      activity and dietary intake.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goal setting has become an integral part of physical activity and dietary interventions;
      however, few studies have examined the theoretical constructs that drive goal-setting theory.
      To address the limitations and gaps in the literature, we designed an 8-week health behavior
      intervention for a racially and ethnically diverse sample of older adults. The primary aim of
      this study was to determine whether older adults randomized to a goal-setting intervention
      for physical activity or fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake would make significant improvements
      in physical activity or F&amp;V intake. The secondary aim of this study was to determine whether
      participating in goal-setting interventions was associated with changes in theoretical
      constructs related to goal-setting. We hypothesized that older adults assigned to the
      physical activity condition would significantly increase metabolic minutes (MET-minutes) of
      physical activity from baseline to follow-up and that participants assigned to the F&amp;V intake
      condition would significantly increase mean servings of F&amp;V. In addition, we hypothesized
      that mean scores of goal specificity, difficulty, effort, commitment, persistence, barrier
      self-efficacy, and task self-efficacy would significantly increase from baseline to follow-up
      for both groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Leisure Time Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity was measured using an adaptation of the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Participants reported how many times during an average week they participated in mild (i.e., takes minimal effort), moderate (i.e., increases your heart and breathing rate a little), and strenuous activity (i.e., caused one's heart to beat rapidly) for at least 30 minutes at a time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal specificity and difficulty</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Specificity and Difficulty. Four items were created for each concept: (1) &quot;The goals I set for number times I will [eat F&amp;V or exercise] in a week are,&quot; (2) &quot;the goals I set for the type of [F&amp;V or exercise] I will [eat or do] in a week are,&quot; (3) &quot;the goals I set for the [amount or duration] of [F&amp;V or exercise] I get in a week are,&quot; and (4) &quot;the goals I set for intensity of my exercise sessions within a week are.&quot;</description>
