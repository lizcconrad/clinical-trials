      The primary objective of the trial is to compare the acute safety and long term outcomes
      between hospitals with cardiac surgery on-site (SOS hospitals) and hospitals without cardiac
      surgery on-site (non-SOS hospitals) for patients with ischemic heart disease treated with
      elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (stable angina, acute coronary syndrome, or
      non-Q wave MI) presenting to non-SOS hospitals.

      The MASS COMM trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled two-arm trial of
      PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals (non-SOS-PCI arm) versus PCI performed at SOS hospitals
      (SOS-PCI arm). The trial is designed to reject the null-hypothesis of inferiority, and
      thereby show the non-inferiority of the non-SOS-PCI arm to the SOS-PCI arm.

      Specifically, 3690 subjects will be enrolled in a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial
      (RCT), in which eligible subjects will be consented and randomized in a 3:1 ratio at the
      non-SOS hospitals for PCI to be performed at either the enrolling non-SOS hospital (3 chances
      out of 4) or a corresponding SOS hospital (1 chance out of 4).

             has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review
             Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site.

         10. The target lesion(s) is (are) de novo or restenotic (including in-stent restenotic)
             native coronary artery lesion(s) with greater than 50 and less than 100% stenosis

             occlusion as evidenced by clinical symptoms.

         11. Target lesions(s) is (are) located in an infarct (if not treated with primary PCI) or
             non-infarct-related artery with a 70% or greater stenosis (by visual estimate) more
             than 72 hours following the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

        Lesions treated with PCI more than 72 hours following STEMI would be subject to the same
        protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above and below with the exception that a
        target lesion of 70% or greater stenosis may be treated with or without symptoms or
        abnormal stress test).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          2. Evidence of STEMI within 72 hours of the intended treatment on infarct related or
             non-infarct related artery.

          6. A platelet count less than 75,000 cells/mm3 or greater than 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC
             less than 3,000 cells/mm3.

          7. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or less than
             150µmol/L).

          8. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials).

          9. Prior participation in this study.

         10. Within 30 days prior to the index study procedure, the subject has undergone a
             previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind. Note: This exclusion criterion

         15. In the investigator's opinion, subject has a co-morbid condition(s) that could limit
             the life expectancy to less than one year, or limit the subject's ability to
             participate in the study or comply with follow-up requirements or impact the
             scientific integrity of the study.

         16. Subject has normal or insignificant coronaries (i.e. coronary lesion(s) less than 50%
             stenosis).

         17. Any target vessel has evidence of:

               -  excessive thrombus (e.g. requires target vessel thrombectomy)

               -  tortuousity (greater than 60 degree angle) that makes it unsuitable for proper
                  stent delivery and deployment,

               -  heavy calcification.

         18. Any target lesion requires treatment with a device other than percutaneous
             transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) prior to stent placement (e.g. but not
             limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy,
             etc.).

         19. Any lesion that is located in a saphenous vein graft, however, lesions located within
             the native vessel but accessed through the graft are eligible.

         20. The target vessel is in a &quot;last remaining&quot; epicardial vessel (e.g. greater than 2
             non-target epicardial vessels and the bypass grafts to these territories [if present]
             are totally occluded).
