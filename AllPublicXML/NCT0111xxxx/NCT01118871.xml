      The purpose of this study is to look at two different antiretroviral treatment options in
      individuals who are about to commence their second antiretroviral treatment.

      This study will assess important clinical and laboratory differences between these two
      therapeutic options. Potential differences include: differences in body fat distribution, in
      lipid parameters, in adherence and in neurocognitive (brain) function. This study is looking
      to show differences in body fat distribution between the two study treatment arms.
      Differences in lipids, viral load, adherence, cardiac and bone biomarkers and neurocognitive
      function will also be assessed. There is also a lumbar puncture sub study participants can
      also take part in.

      The total duration of involvement in the trial will be up to 96 weeks (approximately 2 years)
      plus a screening visit 1 - 4 weeks prior to the start of the study. Including visit the
      clinic on 12 occasions (screening visit, baseline visit, weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 64,
      80 and 96)
