    <textblock>
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study is designed to evaluate the safety
      and therapeutic effects of sapropterin dihydrochloride on neuropsychiatric symptoms in
      subjects with PKU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity and
      leads to toxic phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation in patients with PKU causing mental
      retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral
      abnormalities. Although for most PKU patients early initiation of dietary treatment prevents
      severe complications, discontinuation of dietary restrictions at an early age is associated
      with poor cognitive development and neuropsychiatric disorders are present even in
      early-treated and well controlled PKU patients.

      This study, PKU-016, will be conducted in PKU patients to evaluate the therapeutic effects of
      sapropterin dihydrochloride on the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD), depression, and anxiety.

    <measure>Change in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS) / Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Total Score From Baseline to Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Effects of 6R-BH4 on symptoms of ADHD in PKU subjects who had symptoms of ADHD at screening in the subjects that had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
The total ADHD-RS score and the corrected total ARS score range from 0 to 54, with higher scores corresponding to worse severity of ADHD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Score of 1 or 2 in Global Function Evaluation (CGI-I) From Baseline to Week 13.</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effects of 6R-BH4 on global function in PKU subjects in subjects that had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4 at screening.
The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Effects of 6R-BH4 on symptoms of anxiety in PKU subjects who had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
HAM-A Score is a total score ranging from 0 to 56 with higher scores corresponding to worse severity of anxiety symptoms. The HAM-A has 14 items, each measuring specific anxiety symptom clusters. Each item is given a 5-point-score as: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; or 4, incapacitating.</description>

HAM-D Score is a total score ranging from 0 to 48 with higher scores corresponding to worse severity of depression. The HAM-D is a 17-item depression rating scale. Nine of the items are scored on a 5-point scale as: 0, absence of depressive symptom being measured; 1, doubt concerning the presence of the symptom; 2, mild symptoms; 3, moderate symptoms; or 4, severe symptoms. The remaining 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale as: 0, absence; 1, doubt on the presence of the symptom; or 2, clear presence of symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Effects of 6R-BH4 on global function in PKU subjects who had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the subject's mental illness at the time of assessment, relative to clinician's past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on the severity of mental illness at the time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, among the most extremely ill.</description>

        <description>Effects of 6R-BH4 on symptoms of depression in PKU subjects who had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
HAM-D Score is a total score ranging from 0 to 48 with higher scores corresponding to worse severity of depression. The HAM-D is a 17-item depression rating scale. Nine of the items are scored on a 5-point scale as: 0, absence of depressive symptom being measured; 1, doubt concerning the presence of the symptom; 2, mild symptoms; 3, moderate symptoms; or 4, severe symptoms. The remaining 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale as: 0, absence; 1, doubt on the presence of the symptom; or 2, clear presence of symptoms.</description>

        <description>Effects of 6R-BH4 on global function in PKU subjects who had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the subject’s mental illness at the time of assessment, relative to clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on the severity of mental illness at the time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, among the most extremely ill.</description>

Each item is given a 5-point-score as: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; or 4, incapacitating.</description>

        <description>Durability of the therapeutic effect of 6R-BH4 on depression through 26 weeks in subjects who had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
HAM-D Score is a total score ranging from 0 to 48 with higher scores corresponding to worse severity of depression. The HAM-D is a 17-item depression rating scale. Nine of the items are scored on a 5-point scale as: 0, absence of depressive symptom being measured; 1, doubt concerning the presence of the symptom; 2, mild symptoms; 3, moderate symptoms; or 4, severe symptoms. The remaining 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale as: 0, absence; 1, doubt on the presence of the symptom; or 2, clear presence of symptoms.</description>

        <description>Durability of the therapeutic effect of 6R-BH4 on global function through 26 weeks in subjects who had a blood Phe level reduction after treatment with 6R-BH4.
CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the subject’s mental illness at the time of assessment, relative to clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on the severity of mental illness at the time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, among the most extremely ill.</description>

HAM-D Score is a total score ranging from 0 to 48 with higher scores corresponding to worse severity of depression. The HAM-D is a 17-item depression rating scale. Nine of the items are scored on a 5-point scale as: 0, absence of depressive symptom being measured; 1, doubt concerning the presence of the symptom; 2, mild symptoms; 3, moderate symptoms; or 4, severe symptoms. The remaining 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale as: 0, absence; 1, doubt on the presence of the symptom; or 2, clear presence of symptoms.</description>

CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the subject’s mental illness at the time of assessment, relative to clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on the severity of mental illness at the time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, among the most extremely ill.</description>

The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>
