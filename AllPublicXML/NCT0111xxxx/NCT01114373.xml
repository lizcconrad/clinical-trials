  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of oral melatonin supplementation (24 mg per
      night for 4 weeks) on nighttime blood pressure in African Americans with a history of
      elevated nighttime blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main outcome of interest is the mean nighttime blood pressure. The investigator is also
      trying to see the mechanism of action of melatonin on blood pressure by analyzing data from
      sleep studies to see if melatonin lowers blood pressure by providing a better quality of
      sleep or is that independent of the quality of sleep.

      The investigator is also looking into the effect of melatonin on sympathetic nervous system
      by measuring urinary catecholamines.

      Finally, the investigator is looking into changes in vascular biology markers P-selectin and
      e-selectin) on Melatonin.

    <description>Nighttime mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the average blood pressure in the subject's arteries during one cardiac cycle (one complete heartbeat) at night. It is calculated using the formula, MAP = 1/3(SBP-DBP)+DBP; where SBP is the systolic blood pressure and DBP is the diastolic blood pressure. Means of multiple measurements are reported.</description>
