      The study will systematically investigate the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) in non-remitters of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
      followed by a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) trial with the capacity to
      identify gene variants that predict rTMS response.

    <textblock>
      This is the first study of its kind to systematically investigate the use of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in non-remitters of a selective serotonin-reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI) followed by an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) trial with
      the capacity to identify gene variants that predict rTMS response. The study is similar in
      design to the STAR*D study in that it will be the third treatment stage for a study of
      subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). rTMS is a novel intervention which was FDA
      approved for treatment of MDD in October 2008 and was not clinically available at the time of
      the STAR*D study.

      The primary aim of this pilot study is to provide 10 Hertz (Hz) repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) as
      adjuvant treatment for depression in individuals who have not had a remission of their
      depressive symptoms after an 8 week trial of an SSRI (citalopram or escitalopram) followed by
      an 8 week trial of an SNRI, duloxetine and identify gene variants associated with improvement
      of their depressive symptoms.

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HRS-D17 questionnaire has 17 items. Each item on the questionnaire is scored on a 3 or 5 point scale, depending on the item. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal. Scores of 20 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or very severe depression.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-C16 measures 16 factors across 9 different criterion domains for major depression. Each of the four possible answers to each quiz is given an ascending numerical value from 0 to 3, and the total test score is the sum of the following:the highest number from questions 1-4 + the number from question 5 + the highest number from questions 6-9 + the total of each question from 10-14 + the highest number from questions 15-16.
Screening test scoring ranges:
0-5, No Depression Likely
6-10, Possibly Mildly Depressed
11-15, Moderate Depression
16-20, Severe Depression
21 or Over, Very Severe Depression</description>

    <description>Active 10 Hz rTMS will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) with an intensity of 120% motor threshold. The L-DLPFC location is defined as that area 5 cm anterior to the motor cortex for activation of abductor pollicis brevis. Subjects will receive a total of 3000 stimuli per session. The TMS trains are 4 seconds on and 26 seconds off for a total of 37 1/2 minutes. Treatment will occur 5 days per week for up to six weeks. Subjects will be monitored during rTMS for any side effects or adverse events.</description>
