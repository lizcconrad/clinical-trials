  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this monocentre two-armed double blind randomised placebo-controlled study - in which the
      control group obtains the VNS therapy within a defined space of time after 12 weeks - the
      impact of vagus nerve stimulation on depressive symptomatology of patients with
      therapy-resistant depressive personality disorders shall be analysed. Particularly in
      comorbid disorders, medicamentous treatment shows exceedingly bad response rates. Against the
      background of hitherto insufficient treatment strategies for chronic or persistent depression
      with comorbidities, the proceeding of a study on the effects of VNS on depressive patients
      with comorbid disorders is absolutely essential.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to analyse whether VNS is effective within the therapy of depression with comorbid personality disorders.
It shall be verified, as a primary hypothesis, whether VNS with ongoing stimulation is significantly predominant to a non-stimulating control with respect to reducing depressive symptomatology (for differences within HAM-D score and the response rate as the percentage of patients with a reduction in the HAM-D score of at least 50%, week 1 - week 12, see flow-chart).</description>
