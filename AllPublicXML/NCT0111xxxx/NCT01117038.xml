        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily consent to participate in the study (informed consent form [ICF] must be
             signed and dated prior to any study related assessments).

          2. Adult male subjects of 40 to 65 years of age, inclusive.

          3. A body weight of at least 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2,
             inclusive [BMI will be calculated as weight in kg/(height in m)2].

          4. Subjects are able to communicate with the Investigator, and to understand and comply
             with all requirements of study participation.

          5. Medically healthy, with no clinically significant screening results (e.g., laboratory
             profiles, medical histories, ECGs, physical examinations, etc.), in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history or presence of significant cardiovascular (including thromboembolic
             disorders), neurological, hematological, psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             pulmonary, endocrine, immunologic, or renal disease, or other condition known to
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs or
             place the subjects at increased risk as determined by the Investigator.

          2. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the Investigator.

          3. A predisposition to priapism, such as subjects with sickle cell disease or blood

          7. Hypertrophic obstructive or other clinically significant cardiomyopathy, moderate or
             severe cardiac valvular disease.

             or evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion upon standing from a seated position).

         12. Any history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, history of psychiatric hospitalization,
             greater than one lifetime episode of major depression.

         13. Hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 g/dL.

         14. Positive urine drug test, positive urine alcohol test, or positive urine cotinine test
             at screening or at check-in on Day -1.

             as defined by the Investigator.

         17. Allergy to or previous adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, calcium

             products, within the 14 days prior to Day 1 and throughout the study. Up to 2 g per
             day of acetaminophen is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.

         19. Use of any drug in Appendix 1 (drugs known to interfere with metabolism by the CYP450
             3A4 enzyme) within 30 days prior to Day 1.

         20. Blood donation or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to Day 1.

         21. Plasma donation within 14 days prior to Day 1.

         22. Any use of tobacco or nicotine products within 6 months prior to Day 1.

         23. Any subject who received an investigational drug within 30 days or six half-lives,
             whichever is longer, prior to Day 1.

         24. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both VIVUS or
