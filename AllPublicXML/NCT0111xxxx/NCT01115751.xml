      Study JWAA is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of oral
      LY2780301 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JWAA will consist of the following treatment phases parts:

      Part A - Dose escalation phase using a once-daily dosing schedule. Part B - Dose escalation
      phase using a twice-daily dosing schedule. Part C - Dose expansion phase using the maximum
      tolerated dose from either Part A or Part B.

Starting dose is 100mg. The dose will be subsequently increased to 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 500mg, and 600mg if no dose limiting toxicity is observed at the prior dose levels. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, demonstrate clinical benefit may receive treatment beyond two cycles until disease progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer that is advanced
             and/or metastatic (including Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma). The patient must be, in the
             judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy after
             available standard therapies have failed to provide clinical benefit for their
             disease.

          -  Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) or the Revised Response Criteria for
             Malignant Lymphoma.

        Parts A and B: have measurable or nonmeasurable disease. Part C: have measurable disease.

          -  Have adequate organ function, including:

               -  Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x
                  109/L, platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin greater
                  than or equal to 8 g/dL. Transfusions are not allowed to reach 8 g/dL prior to
                  enrollment.

               -  Hepatic: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN),
                  alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) less than
                  or equal to 2.5 times ULN. If the liver has tumor involvement, AST and ALT
                  equaling less than or equal to 5 times ULN are acceptable.

               -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN or calculated
                  creatinine clearance greater than 45 ml/mn.

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.

          -  Have discontinued previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects
             of therapy: at least 28 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for
             nonmyelosuppressive agents. At the discretion of the investigator, hormone-refractory
             prostate cancer patients who are stable on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
             agonist therapy may have that treatment continued while they are enrolled in this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with an
             experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval
             for any indication.

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions (left to the discretion of the
             investigator).

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis (screening not
             required). Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if they
             are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their disease
             is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 60 days.

          -  Have current acute or chronic leukemia.

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not
             required).

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor
             may affect the interpretation of results.

          -  Have QTc interval of &gt;470 msec on screening electrocardiogram(ECG).

          -  Treatment with a strong CYP3A4 substrate with narrow therapeutic range, strong
             inhibitor, or inducer.

          -  Have history of pituitary adenoma.
