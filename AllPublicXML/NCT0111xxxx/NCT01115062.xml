      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Synera patch versus LMX-4 cream and
      placebo on the level of pain, observed distress, difficulty of venipuncture and skin side
      effects in children undergoing intravenous blood draw in the emergency setting or the
      phlebotomy lab.

      This study will compare the effectiveness of a patch applied for 30 minutes (Synera-lidocaine
      70 mg/tetracaine 70 mg) with the effectiveness of a cream (LMX-4- 4% liposomal lidocaine) and
      a placebo patch applied for the same length of time in reducing pain due to needle sticks in
      children. One hundred fifty children and adolescents 5-17 years old admitted to emergency
      department or presenting to the phlebotomy lab. will be randomly placed in each group.
      Children will rate their level of pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) before the
      medication is applied, after the medication is removed and after the needle stick. Parents
      and research observer will fill out the Observed Behavioral Distress (OBD) score. The
      phlebotomist will rate how difficult it was to perform the needle sticks. Any skin reaction
      seen by the investigator after the cream or patch is removed will be noted and compared among
      the three groups.

      Subjects will be monitored from the time of enrollment to 5 minutes post phlebotomy.The Time
      Frame for which data will be presented is one (1) year.

    <description>The parent, and a blinded research observer will complete the Observed Behavioral Distress Scale (OBDS) tool, which evaluates the observed patient distress at placement of the tourniquet (before venipuncture), at the needle insertion (during venipuncture), and at the placement of the adhesive bandage (after venipuncture).</description>
