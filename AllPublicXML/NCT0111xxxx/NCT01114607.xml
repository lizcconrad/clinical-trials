  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, randomized, five-period, crossover study in healthy
      volunteers to assess the relative bioavailability of four GSK developed oral formulations of
      GSK1605786 relative to the capsule formulation administered in the ChemoCentryx Phase IIb,
      PROTECT-1 Study and ChemoCentryx Thorough QT/QTc Study.

      Approximately 24 subjects will be randomized to receive a single 500 mg dose of each of the
      five formulations of GSK1605786 after a standard breakfast. Serial pharmacokinetic samples
      will be collected following each dose and safety assessments will be performed. The relative
      bioavailability of the GSK capsule formulation will be compared to the ChemoCentryx
      formulation while the relative bioavailability the three other formulations will be compared
      to the GSK capsule formulation intended for use in a GlaxoSmithKline Phase IIb study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, single-dose, five-period, crossover study in healthy
      volunteers to compare the relative bioavailability of 5 oral GSK1605786 formulations.
      Recruitment/screening will occur within approximately 30 days of the first scheduled dose of
      study medication. Each subject will participate in five dosing sessions - each dose will be
      separated by at least seven days. The total duration of a subject's participation in the
      study, from Screening to Follow-up, is approximately 10 weeks.

      All subjects will receive single 500mg doses of the following five GSK1605786 formulations:
      A. ChemoCentryx formulation of GSK1605786; 2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation A] B. GSK
      formulation of GSK1605786; 2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation B] C. GSK direct-fill formulation
      of GSK1605786; 2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation C] D. GSK modified formulation of GSK1605786;
      2 x 250mg capsules [Formulation D] E. GSK tablet formulation of GSK1605786; 500mg tablet
      [Formulation E]

      Formulations A and B will administered in periods 1 and 2 in a random order, and formulations
      C, D and E will be administered in periods 3, 4, and 5 in a random order.

      Subjects will check into the clinical research unit (CRU) 1 day prior to dosing (Day -1). The
      study medication will be administered in the morning of Day 1 with 240 mL of water 30 minutes
      after a standard breakfast (i.e., fed state). For each treatment period, subjects will stay
      in the CRU through the 48-hour PK sample on the morning of Day 3. Subjects may be released
      from the clinic on Day 3 (after all required study procedures are completed) and return to
      the CRU that evening and the next morning for collection of the 60- and 72-hour PK samples.

      Upon completion of the last dosing period or early withdrawal, subjects will return to the
      clinic approximately seven days after the last dose of study medication for a follow up visit
      and be subsequently discharged from the study.

      The study will be conducted at one center.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          2. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG.
             A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          3. Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          4. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until 4 weeks post-last dose.

          5. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 4 weeks post-last dose.

          6. Body weight â‰¥ 50 kg (110lbs) for men and â‰¥45 kg (99 lbs) for women, and BMI within the
             range 18.5 - 31 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          8. 12-lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the
             Investigator, and average QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with
             Bundle Branch Block.

          9. Able to complete all study procedures and planned treatment periods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          2. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          3. Known celiac disease and positive serologic testing for anti-tTG antibodies (required
             to screen for undiagnosed celiac disease)

          4. A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          5. A positive test for HIV antibody.

         15. The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg, or heart rate is outside the range
             of 50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects at Screening and
             pre-dose on Day 1.

         16. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

         17. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

         18. Subject with a medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator and GSK
             Medical Monitor makes them unsuitable for the study.

         19. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

         20. History of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months
