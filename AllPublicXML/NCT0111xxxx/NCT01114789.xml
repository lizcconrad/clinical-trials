  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether obesity has a protective effect on muscle
      proteolysis in hemodialysis patients submitted to a short starvation. This effect will be
      tested by comparing measuring muscle proteolysis, using regional infusion of a tracer amino
      acid (D5 phenylalanine) in two groups of obese and non-obese patients compared to obese and
      non-obese control subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In hemodialysis patients, the risk of death decreases almost linearly as BMI increases,
      including in obese patients. Experimental data suggest that obesity may be associated with a
      reduction of muscle proteolysis during fasting.

      In the hemodialysis patients, after an overnight fast an increased use of endogenous energy
      stores has been reported. The objective of the study is to evaluate the potentially
      &quot;protective&quot; effect of obesity on protein catabolism during short fasting periods.

      Twenty non diabetic patients (men and women) on maintenance hemodialysis for more than six
      months, aged of 30 to 70 years, will be included: 10 obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 10 non obese
      patients (18.5 &lt;BMI &lt;25) will be compared with 20 healthy volunteers (men and women) aged 30
      to 70 years, obese and non obese, according to the same criteria.

      On the investigation day, tracer kinetic studies will be associated with resting energy
      expenditure measurements and body composition analysis (using dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA).
