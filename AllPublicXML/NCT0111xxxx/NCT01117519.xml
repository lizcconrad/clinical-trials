    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of a compound of
      balanced infusion solutions including 50% crystalloid and 50% colloid has a positive impact
      on acid-base balance in elective hip replacement surgery. The application of the study
      medication will be carried out through a goal-directed intraoperative therapy by
      transoesophageal doppler.
