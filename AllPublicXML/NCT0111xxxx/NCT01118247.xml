  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both HA coated and certain uncoated femoral stems have good results in general. On the cup
      side the results are more variable, either with or without HA. HA may delaminate from the
      prosthesis, damage the articulation, witch may lead to osteolysis and aseptic loosening.

      The investigators are investigating whether a well working uncemented hip prosthesis design
      with HA coating, will perform without HA in the long run, when the investigators use pure Ti
      macrostructure and alumina on alumina articulation.

      Hypothesis: The bone ingrowth will be equal when the surface has almost equal roughness in Ti
      and HA version. This means that HA on Ti is not necessary with a well functioning prosthesis
      design.

      0-hypothesis:The two prosthesis perform equal in survival, clinically (HHS),radiographic and
      in patient satisfaction at 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years.

      Investigate survival of the implants and possible biological consequences. Clinical outcome
      with Harris Hip Score. Radiographic outcome with a modified protocol after JRC, JBJS 1990.
      Patient satisfaction with the hip prosthesis (five categories).

      Grit blasted TiAL6V4 + pure Ti versus grit blasted TiAL6V4 + pure Ti +HA, with almost the
      same roughness. Screw cup, double tapered stem, partly double coated cup, proximally double
      coated stem.

      Prospective RCT. Multicenter ( Three hospitals). Selected surgeons. Non-inferiority-design.

      At present 569 hips (391 patients, 178 bilateral) are randomized into the study. Inclusion of
      patients into the study stopped in January 2013.

      548 hips have completed follow ups at an average of 2 years, 301 hips have completed follow
      ups at an average of 5 years and 60 hips at 8-10 years.

    <description>The radiographic evaluation will be carried out postoperatively, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years after the operations with the same protocol modified after Johnston et al, JBJS Am. 1990;72: page 166. We judge and compare a.p pelvic x-rays calibrated on the computer.</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the hip prosthesis.</measure>
    <time_frame>10-30 years</time_frame>
    <description>At the consultations we ask the patient if he/she is satisfied with the hip. The patient may answer i 5 categories (dissatisfied, not satisfied, satisfied, very satisfied and very much satisfied). We also have registrations on early and late complications, leg length discrepancy, Trendelenburg lurch etc.</description>
