  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test a brief 4-session risk reduction intervention, based
      on Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) to reduce the co-occurrence of club drug use and
      sexual risk taking behaviors among non-treatment seeking young men who have sex with men
      (YMSM) in NYC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial. A sample of 300 non-treatment seeking YMSM (ages
      18-24) who report risky sex and club drug use in the past 90 days are being enrolled using
      active and passive community-based recruitment strategies in NYC. After baseline assessment,
      participants are being randomly assigned to one of two study arms: a Brief Risk Reduction
      Intervention Condition - a four session MET intervention piloted for feasibility and
      acceptability among YMSM, designed to increase readiness to change club drug use and
      unprotected sex; or an Education Comparison Condition - four sessions of facilitated
      education regarding the effects of club drugs and unprotected sex. Participants undergo
      follow-up assessments 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline.

    <description>Participants in the MET condition will report greater reductions in the number of unprotected anal intercourse acts and in the proportion of days of club drug use than those in the education comparison condition at the end of the intervention period (3 months) and will maintain greater reductions in the number of unprotected anal intercourse acts and the proportion of days of club drug use than those in the education comparison condition at the three follow-up assessments (6, 9, and 12 months).</description>

    <description>The following factors assessed at baseline will predict club drug use and unsafe sex over the 12-month outcome period: baseline severity of club drug use, baseline severity of other substance use, motivation, decisional balance, and self-efficacy.</description>
