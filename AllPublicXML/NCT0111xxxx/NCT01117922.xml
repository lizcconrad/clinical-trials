  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in which all Philadelphia resident women experiencing a
      pre-term birth (PTB) at &lt;34 weeks of gestation (GA) over an 18 month period will be
      approached at the time of the postpartum hospital stay. Consenting women will be randomized
      into a usual care group or an interconceptional intervention targeting five risk conditions,
      all of which increase systemic inflammation. Our primary objective in this study is to assess
      the efficacy of our interconceptional intervention on the rate of repeat PTB.

      This is a randomized clinical trial in which all Philadelphia resident women experiencing a
      pre-term birth (PTB) at &lt;34 weeks of gestation (GA) over an 18 month period will be
      approached at the time of the postpartum hospital stay. Consenting women will be randomized
      into a usual care group or an interconceptional intervention targeting five risk conditions,
      all of which increase systemic inflammation. Our primary objective in this study is to assess
      the efficacy of our interconceptional intervention on the rate of repeat PTB.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: usual care of interconceptional
      intervention. Those who are randomized into the interconceptional intervention group will be
      targeted for five risk conditions, including smoking, depression, infectious disease burden
      and maternal stress, and achieving an appropriate BMI. It is hoped that by reducing these
      seemingly disparate yet well-known risk conditions, we can reduce PTB and the subsequent
      race/ethnic disparities.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in PTB rate among women with a prior PTB can be achieved through interconceptional interventions targeting multiple as opposed to single risk factors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Women in the intervention group will be assessed every 6 months through 24 months, unless they become pregnant, in which case they will be seen at 20 weeks EGA with their subsequent pregnancy.</time_frame>
    <description>If women do not become pregnant during the evaluation period of 24 months, they will be seen for study visits every 6 months, and will be seen more often for intervention measures to take place, as needed. For those who become pregnant in the evaluation period, they will be assessed at 20 weeks EGA with their subsequent pregnancy, and asked to sign a release for their subsequent pregnancy records.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomized into either usual care or interconceptional intervention groups. If the subject is randomized into the intervention group, she will receive targeted interventions to reduce one of several risk factors: smoking, depression, infectious disease burden and maternal stress, and achieving an appropriate BMI. A woman who is randomized to the intervention group may receive interventions on one, two, three, four, or five of the targeted intervention methods, depending on her needs.</description>
