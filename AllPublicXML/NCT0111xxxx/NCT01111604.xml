  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with metastatic colorectal cancer live
      longer without their cancer progressing when treated with standard chemotherapy, standard
      chemotherapy plus IMC-1121B, or standard chemotherapy plus IMC-18F1.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with 1 of 3 modified FOLFOX-6 (folinic acid [FA] +
      fluorouracil [5-FU] + oxaliplatin [mFOLFOX-6])-based regimens, as second-line therapy.

      During 2010, there has been an identified shortage of injectable folinic acid (FA) in the
      United States. Levo-folinic acid (LFA) will be allowed as a substitute for FA in the
      mFOLFOX-6 chemotherapy regimen in circumstances in which FA is not available, to facilitate
      continuity of patient care.
