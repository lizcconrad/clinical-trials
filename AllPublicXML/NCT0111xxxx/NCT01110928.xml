    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Japan. The aim of this observational study is to collect
      information about the safety and efficacy of Norditropin® in the long-term treatment of
      patients with a SGA (small for gestational age) short stature where the growth plate in the
      long bones (epiphyseal disc) is not closed. An extension to the GHLIQUID-1517 trial
      (NCT00184717).
