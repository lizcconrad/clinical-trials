  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This quantitative, interview-based study will determine if increased prescription medication
      adherence via blister pack administration will reduce suicide related behavior among the high
      risk population of patients discharged from a psychiatric inpatient unit. The aims of the
      project are to determine whether blister packaging medication significantly increases
      treatment adherence and if blister packaging significantly decreases intentional
      self-poisoning behavior (i.e., suicide attempts and completions). By tracking former
      psychiatric inpatients for 12 months post-discharge and obtaining monthly medication
      adherence ratings, we will determine if blister packaging (BP) medications leads to better
      adherence than dispensing as usual (DUA). The psychiatric patients we will be recruiting have
      been diagnosed with, major affective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, post-traumatic
      stress disorder, or schizophrenia (or any combination of these diagnoses). By tracking former
      psychiatric patients for 12 months post-discharge and obtaining monthly reports (self-report
      and medical record review) of suicide-related behaviors, we will determine if patients in the
      BP condition have less intentional self-poisoning behavior than those in the DAU condition.
