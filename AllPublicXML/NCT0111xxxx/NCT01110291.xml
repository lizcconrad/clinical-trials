  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with verified high risk breast cancer will be included in the study. Patients
      will receive three cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of CEF for their adjuvant
      treatment. The phenotype of CYP3A and the genotype of CYP3A5 and MDR1 will be assessed. Also
      the effect of docetaxel in the activity of CYP3A will be measured by peroral midazolam.

      Primary Object:

      The primary object of this study is to define, if it is possible to predict the clearance
      and/ or toxicity of docetaxel by assessing

        -  activity of CYP3A4 by midazolam test (CYP3A4 phenotype)

        -  CYP3A5 genotype

        -  MDR1 genotype

      Secondary object:

      The secondary object of this study is to define whether the treatment with docetaxel alters
      the activity of CYP3A4 enzyme in previously untreated breast cancer patients.

    <description>Docetaxel 80 mg/m² of body surface area (BSA) will be given as an i.v. infusion during 60 minutes on day 0 in a 20-day schedule. The cycle is repeated three times.
Three weeks after the last docetaxel regimen, all patients will receive the CEF-combination treatment. In CEF-combination cyclophosphamide will be given 600 mg/m²of BSA as an i.v. infusion during 15 - 30 minutes on day 0 in a 20-day schedule. This is followed by fluorouracil given 600 mg/m² of BSA as an i.v. infusion during 15 - 30 minutes . Epirubicin will be given 60 mg/m² of BSA as an i.v. infusion during 15 - 30 minutes. This combination therapy will be repeated three times.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. The patient has received information on the purpose of the study and the meaning of
             the treatment, and has given verbal and written consent to participate in the study.
             The patient is accessible for treatment and follow-up.

          2. Histologically verified diagnosis of breast cancer

          3. High risk for recurrence ( node positive or node negative if T2 with histological
             grade 2 or 3, or Pgr negative)

          4. No metastases

          5. Females, age =&lt;60

          6. No concomitant regular medication which is either substrate, inducer or inhibitor of
             CYP3A4

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          1. Poor performance status,&gt;=2 according to WHO

          2. Inadequate bone marrow reserve defined as:

               -  hemoglobin &lt; 100 g/L

               -  leukocytes &lt; 3.0 x 10E9/L or neutrophiles &lt; 1.5 x 10E9/L

               -  plateless &lt; 120 x 10E9/L

          3. Inadequate liver function defined as:

               -  ALAT is &gt; 1.5 x units of normal level

               -  elevated bilirubin (unless verified Gilbert´s syndrome)

               -  alkaline phosphatase is &gt; 2.5 x units of normal level

          4. History of concomitant serious physical or psychiatric disease, which makes a regular
             cytotoxic treatment impossible

          5. cardiac insufficience; severe arrhythmia; severe hypertension; cardiac infarction
             within one year or other active cardiac disease

          6. pregnant or lactating patients
