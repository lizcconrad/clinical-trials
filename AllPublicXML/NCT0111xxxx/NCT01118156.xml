      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new standardized language for categorizing
      suicidal and self-injury related thoughts and behaviors can be readily adopted for use by
      mental health clinicians. Efforts also include developing a measure that can be used to help
      clinicians identify appropriate terms (e.g., behaviors) for specific patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, suicide prevention has received increased focus within the VA. This is in
      part related to concerns regarding the mental health and associated suicide risk of Operation
      Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom military personnel, and a recent study highlighting
      the increased risk of death by suicide for members of the veteran population. Suicide
      prevention initiatives could be greatly enhanced if a clinically feasible uniform language
      regarding suicidality and self-injury was readily available and adopted throughout the VA
      system. With this goal in mind, the Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS) and
      Clinical Tool were developed based upon the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
      nomenclature and VA VISN-19 MIRECC's work in this area. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate whether a new standardized language for categorizing suicidal and self-injury
      related thoughts and behaviors can be readily adopted for use by mental health clinicians.
      Efforts also include developing a measure that can be used to help clinicians identify
      appropriate terms (e.g., behaviors) for specific patients.
