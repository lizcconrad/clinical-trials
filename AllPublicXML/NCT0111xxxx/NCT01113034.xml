      This study will assess the safety of a new study drug called DAS181 (Fludase®). This study is
      being done with NexBio, Inc., the company that makes DAS181 (Fludase®). DAS181 is not
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however the FDA has given permission to
      use DAS181 in human studies. To date, DAS181 has been given to about 81 healthy people and
      has been well tolerated with no reported serious adverse reactions. This is the first
      experimental study to test if it is safe to use this drug in people with well-controlled
      asthma or bronchiectasis. DAS181 is not being given to treat asthma or bronchiectasis, but to
      learn if it is safe to use in people with well-controlled asthma or bronchiectasis. DAS181 is
      being developed as a medication to prevent and treat infections due to common respiratory
      viruses like influenza (including the pandemic H1N1 strain), parainfluenza, and other
      viruses. New drugs to treat respiratory viruses are needed because some currently available
      drugs are not effective against some types or strains of viruses. Drugs that are effective
      against respiratory viruses are especially important for people with asthma or bronchiectasis
      because these lung conditions increase the risk of serious complications due to respiratory
      virus infections. Making sure the new drug is safe in people with asthma or bronchiectasis is
      important because people with these lung conditions may have different side effects from a
      drug than people who don't have asthma or bronchiectasis. We plan to enroll 24 volunteers
      into the study: 12 persons with well-controlled asthma and 12 persons with bronchiectasis.
