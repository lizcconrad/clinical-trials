  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immune response to a live attenuated
      dengue vaccine that could protect people against all 4 types of dengue virus. Live attenuated
      means that while this vaccine contains 4 live dengue viruses the viruses have been attenuated
      (weakened) so as not to cause dengue disease in people. Dengue virus is spread to people by
      mosquitoes and can cause sickness and even death. Seventy-two subjects between the ages of
      18-45 years old will be enrolled in this research study at Saint Louis University Center for
      Vaccine Development. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups to receive 2
      doses of the study vaccine or placebo (inactive substance). Study procedures include:
      maintaining a diary to record temperature and side effects, physical exam, electrocardiogram
      (ECG) (measures the activity of the heart), and blood samples. Participants will be involved
      in study related procedures for about 10 months.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a tetravalent
      dengue vaccine administered subcutaneously or intradermally. The hypotheses being tested in
      this study is whether or not a tetravalent dengue vaccine may be safely administered to
      healthy normal individuals by intradermal (ID) or subcutaneous (SC) injection and provide
      measurable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies against all four dengue virus serotypes.
      The study is also designed to compare safety and immunogenicity between routes of
      administration and dose levels. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of a two-dose regimen tetravalent dengue vaccine administered either SC or
      ID to healthy adult volunteers. Two dose levels will be tested in a dose-escalation format.
      Safety and tolerability will be measured by conducting post-vaccination safety assessments
      including physical examinations, injection site examinations, adverse event monitoring,
      hematology, blood chemistry, and urine dipstick. The secondary objective of this study is to
      assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine, in terms of neutralizing antibodies, against all
      four dengue serotypes when administered at two dose levels by two routes of administration in
      healthy adults. Titers of serum neutralizing antibodies will be measured at pre-vaccination,
      after prime and boost vaccinations and assessed by comparing titers at the two dose levels as
      well as the two routes of administration. In addition, viremia deriving from the attenuated
      vaccine viruses will be measured on days 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 5/6, 7, 9, 11, and 14 after both
      prime and boost vaccinations. Levels of neutralizing antibodies will also be measured in
      samples to be obtained on days 180 and 270 for analysis and submission in a supplement to the
      study report. This study will enroll 72 healthy flavivirus-negative male and female subjects
      between the ages of 18 and 45.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female at least 18 and less than or equal to 45 years old at time of
             screening.

          -  In good health as determined by medical history, physical examination including height
             and weight, and clinical safety laboratory examinations. For creatinine and alkaline
             phosphatase levels the applicable cut-offs for determination are the upper limits of
             normal only, as there is no clinical significance associated with results below the
             lower limits of normal for these laboratory values. For aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the applicable cut-offs for determination
             are less than 1.5 times the upper limits of normal, as there is no clinical
             significance associated with results below the lower limits of normal for these
             laboratory values or with mild elevations above the upper limits of normal.

          -  Laboratory values not listed in Table 3 which are obtained as part of a reference
             laboratory pre-determined panel will be considered as acceptable for enrollment if
             they are either within reference laboratory normal range or within the ranges
             specified for a grade I AE per the protocol Toxicology Tables in Appendix B. Values
             within reference laboratory normal ranges or within ranges specified for a grade I AE
             per the Toxicology Tables in Appendix B will be considered as discussed with the
             medical monitor and may be enrolled with no further discussion. Values with deviations
             outside the ranges specified for a grade 1 AE in the Toxciology Tables in Appendix B
             will be discussed further between the PI and the medical monitor prior to vaccination
             and assessed for impact on volunteer safety. Urinalyses obtained from female
             volunteers on their menses may be repeated after their menses have concluded without
             discussion with the medical monitor. Laboratory values which are not listed in the
             Toxicology Tables in Appendix B and which are out of the reference laboratory normal
             range will be discussed with the DMID medical monitor to determine its relevance for
             safety and impact on enrollment and follow-up vaccinations.

          -  Blood tests negative for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, Hepatitis
             C, dengue, West Nile, and negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen.

             another reliable means of contraception approved by the Investigator (intrauterine
             device, female condom, diaphragm with spermicidal, cervical cap, use of condom by the
             sexual partner or a sterile sexual partner, or abstinence) from screening until after
             the last blood sample (at day 270).

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent to participate.

          -  Willing and able to communicate with the investigator and understand the requirements
             of the study.

             right bundle branch block, incomplete left bundle branch block or sustained
             ventricular arrhythmia, or two premature ventricular contraction's (PVC's) in a row,
             or ST elevation consistent with ischemia).
