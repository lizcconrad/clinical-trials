    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects, age 18-40 years.

          -  Fasting blood glucose within the range 4.0-6.0 mmol/L at Screening, and on Day 1
             before dosing ≥ 4 mmol/L. However, the subject should not be excluded from the study
             if the blood glucose is out of this range once the treatment period has started.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 20-27 kg/m2

          -  Medically stable as determined by history and physical examination, including vital
             signs.

          -  Screening laboratory tests must be within normal range or judged as not clinically
             significant by Principal investigator/Subinvestigator.

          -  Negative urine ketoacidosis test

          -  ECG including QTcB shows no clinically significant abnormality or acute ischemia

          -  Supine BP ≤ 139/89 mm Hg diastolic/systolic, or at the discretion of the investigator

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule, and to understand and comply with other
             protocol requirements.

          -  Capable of giving informed consent, which must be obtained prior to any screening
             procedures.

          -  Negative laboratory screen for Hepatitis B (HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies), Hepatitis
             C (anti HCV) and HIV (1&amp;2).

          -  Willing to refrain from consuming alcohol 48 hours prior to dosing and throughout the
             period of sample collection.

          -  Not on any prohibited medication (See section 8.9), or at the discretion of the
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, or cerebral
             disease, or any other condition which increases risk of participation in this trial in
             the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Currently known malignancy or a history of malignancy within the previous 5 years,
             with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been
             excised more than one year ago with no evidence of recurrence

          -  A chronic or recurrent infectious disease, including but not limited to, chronic renal
             infection, chronic chest infection (bronchiectasis), sinusitis, recurrent urinary
             tract infection (recurrent pyelonephritis or chronic nonremitting cystitis), open skin
             wound, or ulcer.

          -  Other medical conditions, drug treatments or significant medical problems that would
             preclude participation in a clinical trial that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             disqualifies the subject.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial within the prior 3 months

          -  History of GI surgery (other than appendectomy) or known GI motility disorders.

          -  History of a serious infection, including but not limited to hepatitis, pneumonia, or
             pyelonephritis, or have been hospitalized or received intravenous antibiotics for an
             infection, during the previous two months.

          -  A recent adult history of clinically significant allergic reaction to any drug.

          -  History of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract.

          -  Known to have had a substance abuse (drug or alcohol) problem within the previous 5
             years

          -  Alcohol use within 48 hours prior to visits to the study unit.

          -  Unable to undergo venipunctures for study purposes because of poor tolerability or
             lack of easy access.

          -  Engaging in any strenuous exercise (such as running or weight lifting or playing any
             team sports such as soccer) within 48 hours prior to visits to the study unit.

          -  Donation of plasma within 7 days prior to the first dose.

          -  Donation of blood within 3 months prior to the first dose

          -  Difficulty in swallowing capsules.
