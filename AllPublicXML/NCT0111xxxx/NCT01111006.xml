    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Bidet on anal resting pressure with
      regards to various flow rates and temperatures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bidet is an electronic device spraying stream of the water for cleansing the anus and
      sometimes to aid defecation. It is widely used in Korea and Japan, with the flow rate
      (pressure) and temperature of water varying widely among the manufacturers. However, the
      effects of Bidet on anorectal function have not been studied in detail with regards to these
      variables.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The pressure before and after applying the bidet</measure>
    <time_frame>after 1minute</time_frame>
    <description>After the anal resting pressure was stabilized at sitting position, water stream of the bidet was applied to anus for 1 minute under various settings of different pressures (4, 8, 16, 20 gram force, gf), temperatures (24oC vs. 38oC), types of stream (narrow vs. wide) (Total time for experiment at individual subject was about two hours)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The temperature of rectum</measure>
    <time_frame>after 1minute</time_frame>
    <description>The temperature probe was supposed to be placed in the rectum with manometry catheter and to prove the possibility of insertion of warm water into the rectum.</description>

    <description>The volunteers underwent rectal examinations and baseline manometry at lateral decubitus position. Subjects were then placed on a toilet with Bidet attached and manometry catheter was inserted and fixed placing the channels of the catheter at the high pressure zone (HPZ) of the anal canal. Anorectal pressures were measured before and after using the Bidet under different water pressures (4, 8, 16, 20 gram force, gf), types of water stream (narrow vs. wide), and different temperatures (24oC vs. 38oC).</description>
