    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a frequent sequela of breast cancer treatment, that can develop up to 40% of
      patients. Lymphedema is the accumulation of protein-rich fluid (lymph) in the interstitial
      spaces of the affected body part due to a blockage or malfunction in the lymph system. It can
      appear in the arm, shoulder, breast, or thoracic area. Lymphedema swelling causes discomfort
      and sometimes disability. The treatment of lymphedema associated with breast cancer can
      include complex decongestive physiotherapy, compression therapy, therapeutic exercises, and
      pharmacotherapy.

      In this study two treatments will be compared to reduce lymphedema: the manual lymphatic
      drainage (standard care) versus the low frequency sound waves.

      Lymphedema, a sequela of breast cancer and breast cancer therapy, changes functional
      abilities and may affect a patient's psychosocial adjustment and overall quality of life.
      Lymphedema is the accumulation of lymph fluid in the interstitial space. Fluid accumulation
      in the limbs causes enlargement, often with a feeling of heaviness.Chronic inflammation leads
      to fibrosis of the lymphatics, which compounds the problem. Several studies have examined the
      incidence of lymphedema when axillary radiation is given after axillary dissection vs
      radiation to an undissected axilla. The risk of lymphedema is higher in women treated with
      axillary dissection and adjuvant radiation to the axilla, with edema reported in 9% to 40% of
      patients. Patients with lymphedema may report symptoms such as a sensation of arm fullness
      and mild discomfort, which are seen in the early stages of the condition. Joint immobility,
      pain, and skin changes are noted frequently in the later stages of lymphedema. Patients also
      may be predisposed to infections involving the affected extremity. The treatment of
      lymphedema associated with breast cancer can include complex decongestive physiotherapy,
      compression therapy, therapeutic exercises, and pharmacotherapy. Manual lymphatic drainage is
      the standard decongestive therapy. Recently, low frequency sound waves has been used to
      reduce lymphedema. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the manual lymphatic
      drainage versus the low frequency sound waves.
