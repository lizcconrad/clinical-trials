    <textblock>
      To perform a pilot study of the S-FLARE imaging system, which uses low levels of safe,
      invisible, near-infrared light to measure tissue oxygenation during breast reconstructive
      surgery and to compare S-FLARE measurements to the gold standard, FDA-approved, the ViOptix
      optical probe.

      This pilot study will enroll three patients who have chosen to proceed with deep inferior
      epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction. This type of reconstruction uses
      skin and fat from the abdomen to reconstruct a new breast shape. The construct is
      vascularized through perforating arteries and veins that provide a blood supply to this
      tissue.

      Current techniques to evaluate vessel selection rely on a handheld Doppler used for
      confirmation of blood flow and perfusion; however, this modality is limited as it only
      assesses a specific point within the flap.

      The S-FLARE imaging system will be used to visualize vascularization in the DIEP flaps, and
      this study will compare measurements by the S-FLARE imaging system and the standard-of-care
      ViOptix point probe.

    <time_frame>10 minute imaging procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Due to patient-to-patient anatomic variation, the vascular perfusion to the skin in DIEP flaps is unpredictable and of great concern to the surgeon planning the flap design. We propose a method of imaging tissue oxygenation within a DIEP flap base on the use of invisible near-infrared light.
This pilot study is a comparison study of oxygenation measurements taken by the ViOptix optical probe as the standard of care and the S-FLARE imaging system, with the intention of optimizing the ergonomics and functionality of the S-FLARE imaging system for use during breast reconstructive surgery.</description>
