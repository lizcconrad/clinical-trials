  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the time needed to raise
      the oxygen concentration in patient's blood to 90% and his/or her body mass index. The
      prevalence of obesity in our society continues to rise. No studies have shown the time
      required for preoxygenation (oxygen given) in relation to body mass index (body weight in
      kg/height in meter2).

      100% oxygen given to patient before induction of anesthesia (asleep) is the standard clinical
      care. However, studies using various methods have shown differences in terms of the optimal
      time, technique and number of breaths needed for efficient oxygenation. The only difference
      to the standard pre-anesthesia care is that we will record the time to raise patient oxygen
      to 90%. Age is recorded to ensure that the subjects fall within our inclusion criteria. The
      weight (W) in kilograms and height (H) in meters will be used to calculate the body mass
      index (BMI): BMI = W/H2. Alveolar oxygen uptake is dependent on respiratory rate, heart rate,
      blood pressure, temperature and hemoglobin level. These parameters are measured in order to
      identify factors that may affect the accuracy of the study. We will record the pulse oximetry
      value to note the initial oxygen saturation on room air and after the oxygenation.

      Facial hair and mask fit are recorded to assess possible failure of an optimal facemask seal.
      End-tidal carbon dioxide (FE'CO2) is also measured to ensure an adequate facemask seal.
      Anxiety can increase the respiratory rate, heart rate and affect patient compliance with a
      fitted facemask. All of the aforementioned values are recorded to assess reasons for possible
      failure of the preoxygenation technique and inaccurate results.

        The study population will consist of 100 subjects between the ages of 18-50 classified as
        ASA 1 or 2 with no limitations as to gender or race that are scheduled for elective surgery
        at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. There are changes to lung functioning as functional
        residual capacity (FRC), closing capacity, and lung volume after age 50; therefore, the age
        limitation is set to age 50. Changes in lung and chest wall compliance necessitate the
        exclusion of anyone over the age of 50. Minors are also excluded as there is difficulty
        fitting the face mask due to a smaller physiology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants between the ages of 18-50 years with no limitations as to gender or race

          -  Participants classified as ASA 1 or 2

          -  Participants capable of understanding and signing an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conditions which would affect their oxygenation such as heart disease, lung disease,
             anemia (Hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL)

          -  History of smoking (smoking can affect pulmonary function and oxygen carrying
             capacity)

          -  Acute substance abuse (substance abuse can affect respiratory function).

          -  Maxillofacial abnormalities which would interfere with proper face mask seal.
