  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that secondary prevention is very important for patients with established
      coronary heart disease, it reduces both mortality and morbidity. Pharmacists in Norway are
      not routinely involved in follow-up of this patient group, but many studies have shown that
      involvement of a pharmacist have a positive influence in achieving therapy goals for e.g.
      blood pressure, lipids and blood sugar.

      The investigators hypothesis is that follow-up by a clinical pharmacist after hospital
      discharge will increase adherence to clinical guideline recommendations and increase
      achievement of specific therapy goals for blood pressure, lipids and glucose in patients with
      established CHD. The investigators plan to include patients with established CHD, discharged
      from hospital after admission to the cardiology department.

      Patients included (18-80 years) will be randomized to an intervention and a control group. In
      addition to ordinary health care, the intervention group receives follow-up from a clinical
      pharmacist during one year with three meeting points, at discharge, after three months and
      after one year. The control group receives only ordinary health care, but are called in after
      one year for data collection. Patients living in nursing homes, patients already receiving
      pharmaceutical follow-up elsewhere and cancer patients are excluded from the study. Only
      patients living in the area of Tromsoe and nearby is included, as they need to physically see
      the pharmacist.

      The follow-up include medication review and subsequently solving of drug related problems in
      addition to drug information and monitoring of clinical therapy goals relevant for secondary
      prevention of CHD.

      The main outcome measures is adherence to specified review criteria defined in a medication
      assessment tool (MAT-CHDsp) based on recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology.
      Other outcome measures include 1)number of drug related problems identified and solved, 2)
      hospital admissions, 3)deaths.
