  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to test novel, mailed, low-cost, direct-to-patient
      intervention materials (i.e., a personalized letter and osteoporosis information pamphlet)
      designed to increase rates of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) utilization and improve
      osteoporosis quality of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the occurrence of a fragility fracture (e.g. hip fracture) is indicative of low BMD and
      a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis made, osteoporosis can be identified in asymptomatic
      patients using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). United States (U.S.) guidelines
      recommend screening bone density tests using central DXA in all women 65 years or older.
      However, fewer than one-third of eligible U.S. women age 65 and older undergo DXA testing.
      The main barrier to achieving greater rates of osteoporosis screening is identifying a
      systematic, effective, and generalizable way for healthcare providers and patients to
      schedule DXA results.

      Given that national guidelines recommend DXA screening for all older women, the reasons a
      majority of women do not receive DXA testing are likely multifactorial. Patients and their
      health care providers may be unaware of preventative screening recommendations and the
      reasons for these recommendations. Screening tests that are required relatively infrequently
      (i.e. less than once a year) may be difficult for patients and physicians to remember if
      there are few triggers (e.g. seasonality as a trigger to motivate influenza vaccination).
      Additionally, primary care providers (PCPs) are responsible for managing a large number of
      comorbidities and acute care needs and may be unable to stay current with all preventative
      care needs during increasingly short clinic visits.
