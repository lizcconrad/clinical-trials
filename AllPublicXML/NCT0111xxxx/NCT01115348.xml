    <textblock>
      Stroke is the most common cause for motor disability in the grown-up population in the
      Western world. In Sweden &gt; 80 % are above 65 years of age at onset (1).Areas in the brain,
      controlling the movement in the upper extremity (UE) are often damaged at a stroke, which
      leads to impaired function. This impairment of the UE often leads to limitations in
      activities of daily living and reductions in the level of social activities; therefore,
      interventions that will improve function are needed to reduce the consequences for the person
      living with stroke. The time course of recovery of the UE is not clear and therefore the
      optimal timing of the intervention for the person and its content (ways of intervention)
      uncertain.

      The investigators have developed objective assessments of motor performance with new
      technology (kinematic analysis and virtual reality with haptics). Since having an impaired UE
      often results in reduced capacity in daily living and social activities, this might lead to
      decreased participation. To complement the traditional focus on body function, there is a
      need for assessments of the person's activity level and participation, as well as
      self-perceived function.

      The results from this study will lay the ground for an intervention study focusing on
      improved function in the upper extremity.

      Tools to objectively assess upper extremity function and activity Grippit: The handgrip force
      will be recorded, both the peak maximum grip force and the mean value of the ten-second
      sustained grip for the right hand Kinematics: An optoelectronic system is used for the
      three-dimensional motion analysis. This system includes an advanced optoelectronic camera
      system that produces clean and accurate 3D data. Ball shaped markers are positioned on the
      body, and reflect infrared light from camera flashes. Data analysis itself is performed with
      special software. The drinking task test is performed with the person sitting in a
      standardized manner ARAT (Action research Arm Test) is a performance test for UE function and
      dexterity.

      VR The user observes a 3D image displayed above the tabletop using stereographic shuttered
      glasses. The user is able to reach into a virtual space and interact with 3-dimensional
      objects, with a haptic device, which creates the illusion of manipulating virtual objects.

      Tool to assess self perceived function and activity ABILHAND is a questionnaire aiming to
      measure manual ability in chronic stroke. It is interview based and focused on perceived
      difficulty in everyday activities and contains unimanual and bimanual activities.

      Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a scale where the person replies on perceptions regarding life
      after the stroke..

      Impact on participation and autonomy (IPA-E); is an instrument where the person estimates
      perceived handicap and autonomy for persons living in the community
