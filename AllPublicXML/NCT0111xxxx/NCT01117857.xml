      The primary objective of the study is to determine if an eight-week intervention with
      duloxetine significantly reduces depressive symptoms in symptomatic menopausal women. It is
      hypothesized that an eight-week trial with duloxetine promotes significant improvement in
      depression symptoms in menopausal women. The secondary aim of the study is to examine if an
      eight-week intervention with duloxetine significantly reduces vasomotor symptoms in
      symptomatic menopausal women. It is hypothesized that an eight-week trial with duloxetine
      promotes significant improvement in vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Scores as Measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is a 17-item well-validated and reliable measure of current depressive symptoms and their severity. Eight items are scored on a five-point scale (0-4), and nine are scored on a three-point scale (0-2) for a total score range of 0-50. A higher score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Menopause Symptoms as Measured by the Greene Climacteric Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) is a 21-item scale used to quantify the severity of perimenopausal somatic symptoms. Each item is scored 0-3 for a total range of 0-63, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety as Measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening anxiety and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research. Subjects rate the items for severity on a 4-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) for a total range of 0-21. A higher score indicates greater anxiety symptom burden.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hot Flash Interference With Daily Activities and Quality of Life as Measured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The HFRDIS is a 10-item self-report questionnaire in which subjects rate the degree to which hot flashes interfere with daily activities and quality-of-life during the prior week. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for a total score range of 0-100 (higher score indicates greater symptom burden/interference).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Overall Well Being Measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a scale to measure the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Severity is ranked 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. A higher score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change in Overall Well Being Measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</title>
        <description>The CGI is a scale to measure the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Severity is ranked 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. A higher score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>

        <population>Of the 19 participants who received study medication, 16 were considered evaluable for the purpose of analyses as they returned for at least one assessment after starting the study intervention.</population>
