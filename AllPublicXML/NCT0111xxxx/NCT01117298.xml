  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) associated with scleroderma is a difficult problem to treat. Many
      patients develop ischemic digital ulcers due to severe RP that causes considerable morbidity
      and adversely affects the quality of life. In an earlier study, we have observed marked
      improvement in RP attacks and rapid healing of digital ulcers following therapy with
      phosphodiesterase V inhibitor, Tadalafil. In the present multicentric study we aim to study
      the efficacy of Tadalafil in patients continuing to have RP attacks despite using at least
      one or more vasodilators.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male or female subjects between the ages of 18 years and 65 years will be selected for the
        study if they have a clinical diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic
        sclerosis (scleroderma) despite being on vasodilator therapy. Raynaud's phenomenon is
        defined as a history of cold sensitivity associated with colour changes of cyanosis or
        pallor. Patients with a history of at least 4 attacks per week during two-week pre-trial
        period even with treatment with other vasodilators will be recruited. Patients fulfilling
        the diagnostic criteria of scleroderma (as per American College of Rheumatology criteria)
        or having presence of at least 3 of the 5 features of the CREST syndrome (calcinosis,
        Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias)will be
        invited to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with:

          -  Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension,

          -  Evidence of current malignancy,

          -  History of sympathectomy,

          -  Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis or lymphedema within 3 months,

          -  Recent surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia,

          -  Acute Myocardial Infarction, unstable angina, strokes and transient ischemic attacks
             within the past three months,

          -  Smoking,

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days of the study sessions,

          -  Use of medications that might interfere with tadalafil like nitrates and alpha
             adrenergic blockers that have vasoactive effects, and patients taking potent
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole, erythromycin,
             itraconazole, and grapefruit juice,

          -  Patients taking alcohol,

          -  Patients with bleeding disorders

          -  Significant active peptic ulceration,

          -  Current pregnancy,

          -  Current breast-feeding.
