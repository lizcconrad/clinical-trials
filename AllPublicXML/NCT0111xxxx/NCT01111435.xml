  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge on the benefits of individuals
      with MS taking glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®). If patients have less spasticity when taking
      glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®), they may be more likely to have an improved quality of life.

      The hypotheses for this study are:

        1. Study participants who transition from interferon therapy to glatiramer acetate
           (Copaxone®) for a six month period will have a decrease in spasticity.

        2. Study participants who transition from interferon therapy to glatiramer acetate
           (Copaxone®) for a six month period will have a change in perceptions of the impact of
           spasticity on their lives.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a change in spasticity and perceptions
      of the impact of spasticity in individuals with multiple sclerosis who transition from
      interferon to glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®).•

        -  Potential participants meeting the criteria will be identified by Shared Solutions and
           informed of the study. Interested individuals will contact the investigator either by
           email or telephone. Enrollment will continue until there are 110 participants starting
           glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®).

        -  Potential participants will be informed of the details of the study, eligibility will be
           confirmed, and participant's questions answered.

        -  The two study instruments and the sociodemographic questionnaire will be emailed or
           mailed via UPS along with an information letter. May be returned either via email, fax
           or UPS mail.

        -  At month 6 for each participant, the study instruments and sociodemographic
           questionnaire will be sent a second time and returned to the investigator.
