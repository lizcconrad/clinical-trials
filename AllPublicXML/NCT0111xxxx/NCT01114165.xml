  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the clinical value of the SeptiFast Test as
      an adjunct to traditional microbiological, clinical, and other laboratory assessments in
      early detection and identification of a potential pathogen and therefore early targeted
      antimicrobial management of neutropenic hematological patients with suspected infection or
      sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections, including sepsis, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      patients with hematologic diseases. Early diagnosis of infection, rapid identification of the
      causative pathogen(s), and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment (the
      first 24 hours are most critical) all have a major impact on mortality.

      The LightCycler® SeptiFast Test MGRADE (SeptiFast Test) is an in vitro nucleic acid
      amplification test for the direct detection and identification of DNA from bacterial and
      fungal microorganisms in human EDTA whole blood. The SeptiFast test can detect nucleic acids
      from the most common pathogens (approximately 90%) responsible for hospital-associated
      bacteremia. The test is used in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and
      established microbiological assays and other laboratory markers as an aid in antimicrobial
      treatment decision making for patients with suspected sepsis and other bloodstream
      infections.

      This is a randomized prospective study of the use of the SeptiFast Test as an adjunct to
      traditional management of neutropenic haematological patients suspected of having infection
      or sepsis. The study will be performed in a two-armed manner. The blood sample for the
      SeptiFast Test will be collected from all included patients. However, analysis of the
      SeptiFast Test in the control group will only be performed at a later point in time; thus, in
      the control group results will not become available until the end of the study and,
      therefore, cannot be used for guiding clinical decisions.

      Patients complete the study when the episode of infection or sepsis resolves, or the patient
      is discharged from a hospital, or the patient died.
