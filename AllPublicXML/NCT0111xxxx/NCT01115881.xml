    <textblock>
      Signal strength is a parameter introduced in analysis software version 4.0.1, of the OCT
      stratus, that combines SNR and uniformity of the signal within a scan The scale of signal
      strength ranges from 1 to 10, with 1 representing poor image quality and 10 representing
      excellent image quality It has been showed that signal strength has a better image quality
      discriminating ability than SNR The operation manual recommends a minimum signal strength of
      5 for macular thickness measurement There is no consensus on the level of signal strength
      above which should be considered to be good quality The inclusion Criteria for acceptable
      signal strength varies widely in the literature the purpose of our study is to examine the
      relationship between signal strength and macular thickness measured by stratus OCT
