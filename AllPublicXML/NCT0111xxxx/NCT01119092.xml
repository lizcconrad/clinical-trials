  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the examine the effects of gentle movements applied to the ankle
      joint and stretching on self-reported function, ankle motion and stiffness in individuals who
      have suffered from an ankle sprain within the last year and have decreased ankle motion.

      The purpose of this study is the examine the effects of a grade IV anterior to posterior
      joint mobilization and stretching on self-reported function, dorsiflexion range of motion,
      talar glide and stiffness in individuals who have suffered from an ankle sprain within the
      last year and have a 5° dorsiflexion range of motion deficit.

      We will quantify range of motion with standard goniometric measures, stiffness with the use
      of an instrumented ankle arthrometer, talar glide with the use of the posterior talar glide
      test and self-reported function using the foot and ankle ability measure (FAAM) and
      FAAM-sport.

    <description>This group will receive a &quot;laying of hands&quot; treatment in addition to standard treatment. The clinician will place his/her hands in a position to perform the AP joint mobilizations but will not actually perform them. The sham treatment will be performed 3 times and each will last a period of 60 seconds with a one minute rest in between.</description>
