  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, national, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative study to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and temozolomide in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after a first treatment failure. Patients will receive
      bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks until disease progression, consent
      withdrawal, or unacceptable toxicity. Anticipated time on study treatment is 12-24 months.

    <description>PFS was defined as the time, in weeks, from the date of inclusion in the study to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death of the participant due to any cause. Participants that did not have an event at the time the analysis was performed were censored at the date of last contact. Participants that began a treatment other than those planned in this study (bevacizumab or temozolomide) were censored on the start date of the new treatment.</description>

    <description>Overall response was defined as the percentage of participants who obtained CR or PR using adapted MacDonald criteria. CR: disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, confirmed no less than 4 weeks after assessment, no evidence of disease progression; corticosteroid dosage at or below 20 mg hydrocortisone daily; no neurological changes or an improvement as compared to last disease assessment. PR was defined as: Fifty percent or greater decrease in the sum of products of the larger diameter and the larger perpendicular diameter of all index lesions confirmed no less than 4 weeks after assessment, no evidence of disease progression and the absence of progressive, or non-evaluable disease status for non-index legions; unchanged, or decreased corticosteroid dose as compared to the last disease assessment; no neurological changes or an improvement as compared to the neurological examination at last disease assessment.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time, in weeks, from the date of inclusion in the study to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death of the participant due to any cause. Participants that did not have an event at the time the analysis was performed were censored at the date of last contact. Participants that began a treatment other than those planned in this study (bevacizumab or temozolomide) were censored on the start date of the new treatment.</description>
