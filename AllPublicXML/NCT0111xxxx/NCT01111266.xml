    <description>Patients will be treated with 3 different sizes of xevonta (2 weeks each size) for determination of in vivo KUF following &quot;FDA Guidance for the Content of Premarket Notifications for Conventional and High Permeability Hemodialyzers&quot;. In addition blood samples will be collected for determination of removal rates of different small molecules and protein.</description>
