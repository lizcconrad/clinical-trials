  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid administration is a daily intervention on the intensive care unit to improve cardiac
      output (CO) and stabilize circulation in critically ill patients. Simultaneously, the volume
      status of the patient is very difficult to assess. Too little volume leads to inadequate
      organ perfusion followed by ischemia and organ failure. Too much volume may worsen heart
      failure and cause pulmonary and peripheral edema and contribute to further tissue injury and
      organ dysfunction. Although dynamic indices have been shown to be more accurate predictors of
      fluid responsiveness, this relevant and complex task is usually guided by static clinical
      variables and the specialist's interpretation due to the fact that the interpretation of
      dynamic parameters is not fully developed and that they are not universally available. This
      lack of understanding is partially because of the complex interaction with mechanical
      ventilation. The investigators hypothesize that knowing the distribution of ventilatory
      pressures will make it possible to index dynamic parameters to tidal volume and improve their
      predictive value concerning the volume status of the patient. In addition, it would be of
      interest to be able to predict fluid responsiveness in a non-invasive way, especially in
      critically ill patients. Up to now, continuous non-invasive cardiac output monitoring using
      Nexfin in critically ill patients has not been validated and also not tested for its ability
      to predict fluid responsiveness. The present research proposal evaluates the possibility and
      accuracy of the model flow analysis obtained by non-invasive finger arterial pressure
      measurements to determine fluid responsiveness using passive leg raising. It will also be
      compared to a more invasive method (that is currently used in the clinic) to assess its
      ability to measure absolute CO levels accurately. It may make it possible to assess fluid
      responsiveness in a non-invasive and patient friendly way.
