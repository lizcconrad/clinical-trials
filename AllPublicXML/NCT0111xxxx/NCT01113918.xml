  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive
      women. It is estimated that 5 to 10% of women of reproductive age have PCOS. One of the major
      diagnostic criteria of PCOS was chronic anovulation which lead to irregular menstruation,
      amenorrhea, and infertility; the other diagnostic criteria was hyperandrogenism which lead to
      hirsutism, acne and alopecia. Furthermore, PCOS is thought as a metabolic disorder, the
      long-term consequence of PCOS were diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, which are
      potentially dangerous in women health. Early diagnosis and prevention is very important to
      the PCOS patients.

      Obesity is the most potential risk of threat to health of populations. There is a major
      impact of obesity on the PCOS related disorders. Insulin resistance and distribution of
      adipose tissue were thought to be the important risk factors of cardiovascular and metabolic
      syndrome. To treat PCOS patients properly,Wan-Fang hospital had established a specific
      medical team. We recently published in &quot;Fertility and Sterility&quot; about the clinical
      presentation of androgen excess in Taiwanese women. Hirsutism is much less prevalence (30%)
      in Taiwanese PCOS women than that previous reported (65-80%) in theWestern women. It is
      important to know that some clinical presentation of PCOS might have ethic variance. Insulin
      resistance was reported as another candidate that might have ethic variance.We had reported
      about 40% women in PCOS women were obese, it is similar with previous literature reported.
      Obesity is a major factor that could be controlled during the treatment of PCOS.Weight
      reduction is one of our methods in PCOS treatment. The progressive results for obese PCOS
      women would be facing the risks of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.We thought like to
      evaluate the benefit of weight reduction program to the prognosis of obese women with PCOS.

      Furthermore, it is known that Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) be an early marker of
      cardiovascular disease, we would like to know the role of EPC to predict metabolic syndrome
      in women with PCOS. Wan-Fang hospital has a professional team in PCOS treatment and research
      which including gynecological endocrinologist, cardiologist, medical endocrinologist,
      specialist in weight reduction. This team had been working well for more that 4 years.

      We hope we can make a contribution to the study and treatment of PCOS in Taiwan.

    <description>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was diagnosed according to the European Society for Human Reproduction (ESHRE)/American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) case definition which requires presentation of signs and/or symptoms of a minimum of 2 of the following 3 criteria: polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea (Oligo-An), androgen excess (HA).
Body mass index (BMI) was defined as body weight in kilograms divided by body height in meters squared (kg/m2). Obesity was defined as BMI≥25 kg/m2, according to the Asia-Pacific definition.</description>
