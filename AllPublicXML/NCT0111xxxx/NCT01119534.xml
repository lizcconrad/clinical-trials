    <textblock>
      It is believed that the suppository consisting of guaiacol, menthol, camphor and eucalyptol,
      by their pharmacological properties already established for each component, has the ability
      to reduce the signs and symptoms related to upper respiratory infections in a manner
      equivalent (not inferior) to medicine used as a comparator in this study and higher than the
      suppository containing only guaiacol concentration of 12.5 mg.
