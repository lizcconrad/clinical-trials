    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the biological effects in the primary tumor
      following a short, pre-operative course of treatment with PF-00298804 in patients with Oral
      Cavity Cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, biomarker driven, preoperative window of
      opportunity study with a pharmacodynamic primary endpoint. Patients with resectable,
      histologically confirmed OCC for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management,
      will be randomized 2:1 to receive PF-00299804 pre-operatively at a dose of 45 mg once daily
      orally for 7-11 days or to Matching Placebo for 7-11 days depending on surgery schedule. The
      target is a total of 8 days of treatment but with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 11 dosing
      days. All patients will receive surgery as per standard of care without delay. Biomarkers
      from the surgical specimen and baseline tumor biopsy or consent to provide a tumor block from
      existing primary diagnostic tumor biopsy completed within 90 days will be evaluated for
      primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints.

             procedures

          -  Patient must be diagnosed with histologically confirmed oral cavity squamous cell
             carcinoma (OCC) (lip, floor of mouth, anterior 2/3 tongue, buccal mucosa, upper and
             lower gingiva, hard palate and retromolar trigone) considered resectable (T1-4a, N0-2,
             M0; (without distant metastases)) for whom surgical resection of tumor is planned.
             Patients with distant metastatic disease or diagnosis of SCCHN may not be enrolled

          -  Must be able to provide a fresh tumor biopsy prior to randomization for
             histopathological and biomarker evaluation. No anti-neoplastic treatment allowed
             between obtaining baseline tumor specimen and randomization. Patients who decline an
             in-house fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsy must give consent to provide a tumor block
             from an existing diagnostic primary tumor biopsy completed within 90 days of enrolment

          -  Prior treatment with agents targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor is not
             allowed.

             ability to receive study treatment as determined by investigator
