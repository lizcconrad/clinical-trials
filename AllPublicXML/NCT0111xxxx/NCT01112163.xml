  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced external counter pulsation (EECP) is a procedure performed on patients with ischemic
      heart disease. The treatment improves physical capacity and relieves angina pectoris. It is
      suitable for patients with persistent angina pectoris despite and for patients not amendable
      for coronary revascularization. Some studies demonstrate a relationship between diastolic and
      systolic blood pressure ratio (d/s ratio) and the effect of EECP.

      The aim of the investigators study is to understand the effect of EECP on left ventricular
      systolic and diastolic function assessed by trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE).

      Hypothesis: EECP improves left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. There is a
      relationship between d/s ratio and aortic arterial stiffness EECP improves left ventricular
      diastolic function Standard TTE would be performed prior the EECP procedure, which lasts 60
      min., and repeated every 15 minutes. Moreover the investigators would measure pulse wave
      velocity, a measure of aortic arterial stiffness, in order to investigate the relationship
      between the d/s ratio and arterial stiffness.

      The patients would be recruited among former study patients who have undergone EECP before.
      20 patients with the best acoustic conditions would be selected and invited to enroll into
      the study.

    <description>While an individual is undergoing ECP, they have pneumatic stockings (also known as cuffs) on their legs and are connected to telemetry monitors that monitor their heart rate and rhythm.The cuffs should ideally inflate at the beginning of diastole and deflate at the beginning of systole. During the inflation portion of the cycle, the calf cuffs inflate first, then the lower thigh cuffs and finally the upper thigh cuffs. Inflation is controlled by a pressure monitor, and the cuffs are inflated to about 300 mmHg.</description>
