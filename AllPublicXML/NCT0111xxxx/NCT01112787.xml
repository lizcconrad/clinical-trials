      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the irritation level of tazarotene foam after 21
      days of exposure on the skin of healthy volunteers.

      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam to induce cutaneous irritation using a 21 day
      cumulative irritation assay in healthy adult volunteers. Approximately 40 healthy male and
      female volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65 years will be enrolled. All subjects will be exposed
      to patches containing tazarotene foam, vehicle foam, sodium lauryl sulfate 0.5% (positive
      control), and distilled water (negative control). Each set of patches will be applied to the
      same randomized sites once daily for 21 days; patches will be removed after 24 Â±1 hours and
      the patch sites will be evaluated for signs inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema, edema,
      papules) and superficial effects.
