      An intensive intervention of specially trained paraprofessionals, called community oral
      health specialists (COHS), administering on a quarterly basis for 2 years fluoride varnish
      and oral health promotion education, compared to usual care, will reduce decayed, missing,
      and filled tooth surface measures at 2 years for children in American Indian Head Start
      Programs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design will be a clustered randomized design. Fifty-two head start classes in a
      Southwest American Indian Reservation will be randomized, 26 to the intervention program and
      26 to usual care. The intervention will be comprised of specially trained paraprofessionals,
      called community oral health specialists (COHS), administering fluoride varnish and oral
      health promotion education quarterly for 2 years. Baseline and annual measures of decayed,
      missing, and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) of the children, and surveys of their caregivers'
      dental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors will be completed. The study will be a 5-year
      study, with 2 years for intake/accrual, and 3 years of follow-up.
