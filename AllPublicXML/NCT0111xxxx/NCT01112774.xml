  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the novel treatment of transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) could decrease the pain perception of those with spinal cord
      injury.

      We will also determine whether these changes are correlated with the clinical outcome (pain
      reduction).

      The active tDCS stimulation sessions will be compared to sham stimulation.

      More study details will be provided by Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

        STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (similar to the criteria of the Interstitial Cystitis Network)

          1. Providing informed consent to participate in the study

          2. 18 to 64 years old

          3. with traumatic spinal cord injury (complete or incomplete) - for instance, due to
             fall, car accident or gun shot; (for spinal cord injury only)

          4. stable chronic pain for at least the three preceding months(for spinal cord injury
             only)

          5. score higher or equal to 4cm (0 cm= 'no pain' and 10cm='worst possible pain') on the
             Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain perception at the baseline/start of the
             treatment(for spinal cord injury only)

          6. refractoriness to drugs for pain relieve - such as tricyclic antidepressants,
             antiepileptic drugs and/or narcotics (pain resistant to at least 2 of these drugs
             supplied in adequate dosages for six months) (for spinal cord injury only)

          7. pain is not attributable to other causes, such as peripheral inflammation.

          8. No clinically significant or unstable medical or psychiatric disorder

          9. No history of substance abuse

         10. No neuropsychiatric comorbidity
