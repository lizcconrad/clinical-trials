  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, remarkable advances in medical oncology, surgery, and radiology have allowed
      for increasing cure rates for childhood malignancies. This success has led to an emerging
      understanding of the kinds of effects that treatments can have on the pediatric population
      and how such effects can influence pediatric cancer survivor's functioning and quality of
      life. It has become tremendously important to assess the long-term complications due to
      therapy in this growing sector of survivors and to tailor our treatments so as to minimize
      these late effects.

      The Investigators at MGH are committed to improving the delivery of radiotherapy to our
      patients and improving the outcome for these patients. MGH has an on-site cyclotron for
      proton radiotherapy in order to provide the most advanced care for patients in need. Proton
      therapy possesses a clinical advantage over standard photon therapy in that its optimal dose
      distribution delivers the bulk of radiation to the tumor site. This method spares the
      greatest volume of normal tissue, resulting in decreased short-term and long-term morbidity.

      Through open pediatric protocols for patients treated with proton radiotherapy, the
      investigators aim to define and report the acute and late effects associated with treatment.

      The investigators also treat a number of patients off-protocol with both proton and photon
      radiotherapy, and are interested in reporting these patients' QOL outcomes in conjunction
      with other clinical data that may be pertinent to the site of tumor treatment. This research
      is significant in that it will allow us to delineate the positive and negative effects of
      radiation treatment on patients' QOL, highlighting points of success and exposing areas that
      are in need of improvement. Such knowledge will be used to improve the experience of
      pediatric cancer survivors in the future.

      The aims of this study are: 1) to prospectively collect and report the QOL outcomes in
      patients treated with radiotherapy and 2) to correlate the QOL data with pertinent clinical
      information.
