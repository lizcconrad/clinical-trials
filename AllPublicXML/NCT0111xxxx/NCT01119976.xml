      This is a research study to look at the association between weight loss and the menstrual
      cycle in healthy, overweight, premenopausal women. Participants will be asked to follow a
      reduced-calorie diet and exercise plan for 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two different reduced calorie diet and exercise plans will be compared. One plan changes diet
      and exercise prescription with the phases of the menstrual cycle, while the other is a
      standard reduced calorie diet and exercise plan based on MyPyramid.gov website.
