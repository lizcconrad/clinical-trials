  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline antibiotics are included in the chemotherapy regimens of approximately 82% of
      patients with bone cancer and 44% of those with soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed in childhood or
      adolescence. Impaired cardiac function occurs after treatment with anthracyclines. The
      frequency of impairment increases with increasing cumulative dose. There are inadequate data
      regarding the relationship between doxorubicin administration and changes in serum levels of
      cardiac troponin T (cTn-T) or I (cTn-I), N-terminal (NT) brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or
      tissue Doppler imaging parameters.

      This non-therapeutic study proposes a prospective, single arm study of serial changes in
      tissue Doppler imaging parameters, cTn-T and NT-BNP in children and adolescents with
      malignant bone and soft tissue tumors whose planned chemotherapy includes treatment with ≥
      375 mg/m2 of doxorubicin.

      The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the usefulness of serial determinations of tissue
      Doppler imaging, cTn-T and NT-BNP for very early identification of anthracycline-related
      myocardial injury. Demonstration that one or more of these markers identifies subclinical
      myocardial damage and that biomarker or tissue Doppler imaging parameters exhibit a
      dose-response relationship with cumulative doxorubicin dose would facilitate intervention
      trials in patients at risk for anthracycline cardiomyopathy.

      The primary aim of this proposal is to serially evaluate imaging tests in previously
      untreated patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors(ESFT),
      rhabdomyosarcoma and intermediate and high-risk non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas
      whose planned treatment includes a cumulative doxorubicin dose ≥ 375 mg/m2 to determine if
      serial levels of one or more of these potential markers of cardiac muscle injury obtained
      prior to each infusion of doxorubicin and at the completion of chemotherapy correlate with
      increasing cumulative anthracycline exposure.

      The secondary aim of the study is to estimate the proportion of patients with decreased
      (evaluation j - evaluation j+1) peak longitudinal systolic strain (ε) or strain rate (SR),
      peak radial systolic ε or SR, peak radial systolic myocardial velocity or peak longitudinal
      systolic myocardial velocity among those who have a shortening fraction (SF) ≥ 29% prior to
      each infusion of anthracycline. This study will evaluate whether the serum levels of cTn-T
      and/or NT-BNP will increase following doxorubicin administration. The study will evaluate
      whether the serum levels of cTn-T and/or NT-BNP will increase with increasing cumulative
      doxorubicin dose.
