      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with
      progressive or recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic thyroid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of everolimus in patients with progressive or recurrent,
           unresectable, or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine maximum percentage of tumor reduction in these patients.

        -  To describe activity time to event endpoints.

        -  To assess toxicity.

        -  To determine evolution of serum thyroglobulin.

        -  To perform explorative pharmacogenomic, pharmacokinetic, and translational studies.
           (exploratory)

        -  To investigate efficacy of everolimus in patients with progressive or recurrent,
           unresectable or metastatic disease of undifferentiated (anaplastic) or medullary thyroid
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
