      RATIONALE: A breast cancer rehabilitation program and exercise therapy may help improve the
      quality of life of breast cancer survivors.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies a breast cancer rehabilitation program in improving
      quality of life in breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate accrual, retention, adherence, and participation of breast cancer survivors to
      a breast cancer rehabilitation program.

      II. To estimate the variability of weight, six-minute walk, quality of life and other
      psychosocial and physical measures in women participating in the BCRP.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in the anthropometric, psychosocial, and physical outcomes over the
      six-month period of the BCRP.

      II. To document the types and the rates of adverse events associated with the BCRP.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients attend exercise therapy sessions over 1 hour 3 times a week for 6 months. Exercise
      therapy sessions are comprised of a 10 minute warm-up of light stretching and aerobic type
      exercise (walking, cycling), 30 minutes of endurance type exercise (cycle, walking), and 20
      minutes of resistance training exercise.
