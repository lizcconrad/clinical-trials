    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in
      Canada. Most stroke survivors live with residual impairments that diminish independence and
      quality of life. This may include vascular cognitive impairment (loss of ability to plan,
      think and reason) which can lead to dementia and loss of mental and functional independence.

      The current treatment to reduce stroke induced brain tissue injury is limited to
      thrombolytics (clot busters), a therapy useful only if given in the first hours following
      stroke. One major new approach aims to reduce cell death after stroke by targeting the
      ongoing tissue loss initiated by the stroke. The tissue can be maintained by interfering with
      later neurochemical processes that are activated by stroke, potentially through activating
      natural substances in the brain that help survival and growth of nerve cells (&quot;neurotrophic&quot;
      factors).

      The recent recognition of lithium as a neurotrophic agent has generated the first studies of
      lithium treatment for managing brain diseases. Clinically, lithium has now been shown to
      increase brain gray matter volume in bipolar patients. This effect is potentially important
      in stroke because gray matter loss has been implicated in the development of cognitive
      impairment after stroke, a result of the series of brain processes that are activated by lack
      of oxygen due to stroke. Our primary objective is to examine the effects of lithium on total
      brain gray matter volume in the post-stroke population, as measured by volumetric magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) with the hope that lithium may increase gray matter volume in
      post-stroke patients and lead to greater cognitive and functional rehabilitation. This study
      will provide valuable information on the tolerability of lithium, and its effects on clinical
      outcomes relevant to stroke, providing the information needed for designing a large-scale
      clinical trial.

      The recognition of lithium as a neurotrophic agent has provided a rationale for evaluation of
      this agent in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Numerous animal and in vitro studies have
      shown lithium-mediated neurotrophic effects involve mechanisms highly relevant to the
      post-stroke population: the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
      inhibition of abnormal activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). Lithium has
      consistently been shown to increase serum concentration of the neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
      BDNF is involved with neuronal proliferation, survival, and differentiation and it
      facilitates cortical reorganization and functional recovery after focal ischemia (in rats).
      GSK-3 is a neurotrophic intermediary. In animal and in vitro models, lithium treatment
      effectively reduces the severity of ischemic damage and protects against ischemic damage of
      central nervous system (CNS) neurons resulting from glutamate-induced cell death.
      Importantly, these benefits were present when lithium was given after ischemic events rather
      than prophylactically.

      The goal of pharmacotherapy post-stroke is to enhance restoration of neurological function
      and limit structural degradation. Gray matter atrophy is a relevant post-stroke relevant
      outcome as it has been implicated in the development of vascular cognitive impairment after
      stroke and is a result of the series of neurochemical processes that are activated by
      ischemia. While the first clinical studies examining the neurotrophic effects of lithium and
      its effects on total gray matter volume in bipolar subjects have just emerged, this has yet
      to be explored in the post-stroke population. Our primary objective is to determine the
      tolerability of lithium following a stroke and to examine its effects on clinical outcomes
      including total brain gray matter volume as measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI).

      In this feasibility study, lithium carbonate (target 0.4 to 0.8 mmol/L) will be given
      open-label for 60 days, to consenting patients with unilateral ischemic cortical lesions.
      Total gray matter volume using magnetic resonance imaging will also be measured at baseline
      and termination, and related to changes in clinical outcomes (standardized scales measuring
      cognitive, activities of daily living, motor recovery) performed at the time of the MRIs. We
      expect to find that post-stroke patients receiving lithium will have increases in gray matter
      volume, and that increase in gray matter volume will predict improvements in clinical
      outcomes over 60 days. In addition, since lithium has been shown to increase serum
      concentration of the neurotrophic factor, BDNF, we will explore the relationship between
      plasma BDNF concentrations and neurological and clinical outcomes.

      This study will provide key information of clinical importance that will determine whether a
      clinical trial with lithium is desirable and feasible. Results of this project have the
      potential to focus the development of lithium as a new treatment strategy that would improve
      outcomes at both the individual and societal level.
