  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms for oscillations of dietary
      fat/carbohydrate intake and how fat intake affect insulin resistance and liver fat over
      interval of 3 to 4 days.

    <textblock>
      You will be expected to keep diet records for 17 consecutive days. You will start with a
      fasting screening visit (only water allowed). A physical exam and Medical history it taken at
      screening visit. Your body composition will be gathered by CT and Dexa Scan. Blood and urine
      will be collected for a chemical profile and other determinations. Questionnaires will be
      administered along with an accelerometer to be worn for the remainder of the study. The final
      day you will return the dietary records, accelerometer, and a few procedures will be
      performed as weight.
