  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, such as gastric, biliary, or
      pancreatic carcinoma, present with metastatic disease, and have an extremely poor survival,
      irrespective the type of treatment modality. The aim of the current monocentric phase II
      study is to evaluate in these patients the effectiveness of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus
      hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin (HIPC). The study is
      designed to have at least 80% power to detect a 40% increase in 1-year overall survival
      common to all strata (gastric-biliary-pancreas) after CRS+HIPC. Over an anticipated period of
      2 years, 60 patients will undergo CRS + HIPC. Translational research will quantify
      perioperative circulating and peritoneal tumour cells, based on real-time RT-PCR for CEA and
      EpCAM. Plasma concentration of cytokines will be determined for IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,
      IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-γ, and VEGF at several time-points. Systemic immunological
      changes will be assessed by flow cytometric quantification of the relative proportions and
      absolute numbers of B- and T-lymphocytes, NK cells, effector T cells, HLA-DR+ T cells, and
      regulatory T cells. Gene-expression studies will be performed using Affymetrix HG U133 Plus
      2.0 arrays on primary and metastatic tissue samples.

      ASSESSMENT of TUMOUR BURDEN • Tumour burden will be assessed using diagnostic imaging
      modalities and verified by surgical or laparoscopic evaluation before CRS+HIPC

        -  Primary tumour Biliary adenocarcinoma

             -  Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma &lt; 3 cm in diameter

             -  Extrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma without invasion of major blood vessels
                (portal vein, hepatic arteries, coeliac trunk) Gastric adenocarcinoma Macroscopic
                surgical margin of 5 cm is needed to obtain complete tumour removal Pancreatic
                adenocarcinoma Tumours located in the head, body or tail of the pancreas without
                portal hypertension due to complete encasement of mesenteric/portal vein and
                collateral venous circulation

        -  Liver metastases

             -  Only liver metastases with stable disease or clinical response to prior systemic
                therapy for a period of at least 3 months are eligible

             -  Not more than 3 metastases, each measuring 3 cm or less in diameter

             -  Sugarbaker's peritoneal cancer index (PCI) will be used to assess peritoneal tumour
                burden 28. The completeness of cancer resection (CCR) will be assessed by the
                surgeon at the end of CRS; CCR-0 no macroscopic residual tumour, CCR-1 no residual
                tumour nodules greater than 2.5 mm, CCR-2 residual tumour nodules larger than 2.5
                mm in diameter.

             -  Patients with PCI &lt; 20 are eligible for this study 11.

      THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION

        -  CRS is defined as macroscopic tumour removal using surgical resection and/or LAT

           o Primary tumour Biliary adenocarcinoma

        -  Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma

             -  Deep parenchymatous tumours are treated by LAT

             -  Superficial peripheral tumours are treated by resection or LAT

             -  Distance between tumour and major biliary structures (right, left, main hepatic
                duct) needs to be &gt; 1 cm

        -  Extrahepatic cholangiocellular tumours are treated by surgical resection and
           biliodigestive reconstruction

        -  Distal cholangiocellular tumours with intrapancreatic location are treated by
           pancreaticoduodenectomy or LAT at 90°C

        -  Lymph nodes around the hepatoduodenal ligament are removed Gastric adenocarcinoma

        -  Partial gastrectomy can be performed either by proximal or distal gastrectomy dependent
           on tumour location and size

        -  Total gastrectomy is performed in patients with signet-ring cell cancers or linitis
           plastica

        -  Tumour-draining lymph nodes are removed Pancreatic adenocarcinoma

        -  Tumours located in the head of the pancreas and with radiologic or macroscopic vascular
           invasion, which need vascular reconstruction at the time of surgery, are treated by LAT
           at ablation temperature of 90°C

        -  Tumours located in the head of the pancreas without radiologic or macroscopic vascular
           invasion are treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy or LAT at 90°C

        -  Tumours located in the body or tail of the pancreas are treated by resection or LAT of
           90°C

        -  Tumour draining lymph nodes are removed

           o Liver metastases

        -  Tumours up to 3 cm are treated by LAT (RFA or MWA)

        -  Solitary tumour measuring 3 - 5 cm is treated by resection

        -  Superficial peripheral liver metastases (any diameter up to 5 cm) are allowed to be
           resected

           o Peritoneal metastases

        -  Peritonectomy, electrofulguration of superficial (&lt; 3mm depth) metastases, and organ
           resection are allowed

        -  HIPC is administered immediately after CRS: cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is
           dissolved in 3 litres of normal saline heated to less than 41° Celsius and infused into
           the abdominal cavity for a sustained hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for 60
           minutes. Surgical reconstruction (anastomoses) is performed after HIPC.

      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH

        1. Perioperative quantification of peritoneal and circulating tumour cells

             -  Real-time qRT-PCR based on detection and quantification of CEA and EpCAM mRNA
                transcripts

             -  Circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood samples will be studied before and at
                the end of surgical procedure (CRS+HIPC)

             -  Peritoneal tumour cells will be evaluated in lavage fluid at the start of surgery
                (before any manipulation) and at the end of CRS+HIPC

        2. Perioperative systemic cytokine profiles and lymphocyte immunophenotyping

             -  Plasma concentration of cytokines will be determined using the BDTM Cytometric Bead
                Array (CBA): IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-γ, and VEGF

             -  The relative proportions and absolute numbers B-lymphocytes (CD19+), T-lymphocytes
                (CD3+), NK cells (CD56+CD3-), effector T cells (CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+), HLA-DR+ T
                cells (CD3+HLA-DR+) and regulatory T cells (CD3+CD4+25+127low) will be quantified
                with flow cytometry.

             -  Time-points for cytokine and immunophenotyping analyses: before surgery (d-1), at
                the end of surgery (d0), day after (d1) and at day 7 following CRS+HIPC

        3. Gene-expression of primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer

             -  To better understand cancer biology and search for novel diagnostic and therapeutic
                targets, fresh tissue samples from the primary tumour and from metastases will be
                stored in RNA-later for RNA-extraction and future analyses. Hereto, samples
                obtained from biliary, gastric, and pancreatic cancer tissue will be stored. Based
                on the fact that pancreatic cancer is associated with the worst prognosis, and
                based on our ongoing research on this disease, gene expression studies in the
                current project will be focused on pancreatic cancer.

             -  In close collaboration with the department of pathology, we have stored snap-frozen
                tissue samples from surgically resected human pancreatic cancer for future
                research. Clinical, histopathological, and survival data of over 200 patients are
                registered in our database. Tissue samples (primary and metastases) from the
                current study will be analysed together with available 96 primary tumour samples
                that have already been controlled to be representative for high quality RNA
                studies. These samples are obtained from patients with early and advanced localized
                pancreatic cancer in various tumour stages. Gene-expression studies will be
                performed using Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 arrays on primary and metastatic tissue
                samples. These experiments will be conducted in close collaboration with the
                microarray facility of VIB at KUL.
