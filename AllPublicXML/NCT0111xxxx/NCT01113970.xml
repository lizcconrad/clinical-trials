    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I/II trial of a novel Indibulin dosing schedule for the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will have measurable or non-measurable,
      metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer and may have received any number
      of prior therapies for their disease.

      It is expected that the Phase I portion will enroll up to 20 patients and the Phase II
      portion will enroll up to 45 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma of the breast.

          -  Clinical evidence of metastatic disease or locally advanced disease not amenable to
             curative therapy.

          -  Measurable or non-measurable lesions according to the RECIST Version 1.1 2009.

             weeks prior to beginning study drug. Endocrine therapy may not be used concurrently
             with protocol treatment. All acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia or neuropathy) of
             any prior therapy must have resolved to NCI CTC (version 4.0) Grade ≤ 1 or to baseline

          -  Patients with HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or FISH-amplified) breast cancer must have
             received trastuzumab or have a contradiction to receiving HER2- targeted therapy (such
             as abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction)as determined by the treating
             physician.

             study or within 3 weeks of study start. Mitomycin C or nitrosureas should not be given

          -  Concurrent radiation therapy is not permitted during treatment on protocol.

          -  History of an invasive second primary malignancy diagnosed within the previous 3
             years, except for Stage I endometrial or cervical carcinoma or prostate carcinoma
             treated surgically, and non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Any medical, psychological or social condition that may interfere with the subject's
