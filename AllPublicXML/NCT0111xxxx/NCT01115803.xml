    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dose Escalation portion (Part 1): have histological or cytological evidence of a
             diagnosis of cancer that is advanced and/or metastatic disease (including
             Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma) for which no proven effective therapy exists.

          -  Dose Confirmation portion (Part 2): have histological or cytological evidence of:

               1. Arm A: advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at
                  least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

               2. Arm B: advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or
                  sorafenib, or advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

          -  Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) or the Revised Response Criteria for
             Malignant Lymphoma.

               1. Dose Escalation portion (Part 1): patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable
                  disease.

               2. Dose Confirmation portion (Part 2): patients must have measurable disease.

          -  Have adequate organ function including:

               1. Hematologic: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x
                  109/L, platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin greater
                  than or equal to 8 g/dL.

               2. Hepatic: bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN);
                  alanine transaminase (ALT) and AST less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN. If the
                  liver has tumor involvement, AST and ALT equaling less than or equal to 5 times
                  ULN are acceptable. Patients with bone metastases may enter with alkaline
                  phosphatase values less than or equal to 5 times ULN, as long as other hepatic
                  parameters meet inclusion criteria.

               3. Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN or calculated
                  creatinine clearance &gt;45 ml/mn.

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, cancer-related hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy for at
             least 2 weeks (3 weeks for myelosuppressive agents) prior to study enrollment, and
             have recovered from the acute effects of therapy. At the discretion of the
             investigator, patients with prostate cancers progressing under LHRH agonists therapy,
             and patients with adrenal carcinomas using mitotan, may have that treatment continued
             while receiving study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any
             indication within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study drug for a
             nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agent, respectively.

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would preclude participation in this study.

          -  Have symptomatic CNS malignancy or metastasis. Patients with treated CNS metastases
             are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable and asymptomatic, and
             they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants. Screening of
             asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastasis is not required.

          -  Concomitant treatment by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers.

          -  Have an acute or chronic leukemia.

          -  Have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant within 75 days of the
             initial dose of study drug. In addition, recipients of an allogenic stem-cell
             transplant must have discontinued immunosuppressive therapy at least 24 hours before
             study drug administration with no more than Grade 1 acute graft-versus-host disease.

          -  For Dose Confirmation portion (Part 2): have previously received erlotinib for Arm A
             or everolimus for Arm B.
