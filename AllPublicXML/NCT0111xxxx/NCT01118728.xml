      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the long term safety of Sarilumab (SAR153191/REGN88) in participants with
           ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the long term efficacy of Sarilumab (SAR153191/REGN88) in participants with AS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maximum study duration per participant was to be 267 weeks (approximately 5 years) broken
      down as follows:

        -  screening up to a maximum of 1 week;

        -  treatment up to a maximum of 260 weeks;

        -  follow-up of 6 weeks after treatment discontinuation.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to the end of study (66 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of the relationship to the investigational medicinal product (IMP). SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was a medically important event. TEAEs were AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the TEAE period (time from first dose of IMP up to the end of follow-up period).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved 20% Response in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Working Group Criteria for Response (ASAS20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to the end of treatment (60 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response for ASAS20 was defined as: Improvement of ≥ 20% and ≥ 1 unit on a 0 (least) to 10 (worst) numerical rating score (NRS) in at least 3 of the 4 ASAS improvement criteria (ASASIC) domains, and no worsening of ≥ 20% and ≥ 1 unit on 0-10 NRS in the remaining domain. The 4 domains included were participant's global disease activity assessment, total back pain, physical function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), and Inflammation (mean of last 2 Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index questions on morning stiffness).</description>
