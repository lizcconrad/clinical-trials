  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring condition of the lungs the
      cause of which is unknown.There are currently no effective treatments for IPF and the
      condition tends to cause progressive disability and death with an average survival of 3.5
      years from diagnosis. The condition is responsible for the deaths of 4000 people per year in
      the UK. At present the definite diagnosis of IPF rests on the identification of a specific
      pattern of fibrosis when a section of fibrotic lung tissue is examined under a microscope.
      Unfortunately, the process of obtaining a lung biopsy requires an operation and is not with
      out risk. The investigators hope to identify specific markers in the blood and lungs of
      patients with IPF that will enable the condition to be diagnosed without biopsy. Furthermore,
      the investigators hope to identify indicators(biomarkers) that will predict which patients
      have more aggressive and progressive disease and also to identify biomarkers that might be
      useful in identifying a response to treatment and might therefore be used in future clinical
      trials in IPF. As well as looking at markers in the blood and lungs the investigators also
      plan to assess the use of daily home lung function measurement and a computerised technique
      for analyzing lung sounds to see if these are investigations that are able to predict the
      development of worsening lung fibrosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals over the age of 18 with a diagnosis of definite or probable IPF or
             definite or probable fibrotic NSIP as defined by the ATS/ERS consensus classification

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with co-existent conditions known to be associated with the development of
             fibrotic lung disease will be excluded.

          -  This includes

               -  connective tissue disease

               -  suspected drug-induced lung disease

               -  asbestosis or other asbestos related disease (pleural plaques, mesothelioma,
                  asbestos pleural effusions)

               -  granulomatous disease including sarcoidosis.

          -  Patients with an auto-immune profile considered diagnostic for a specific connective
             tissue disease will be excluded, even in the absence of systemic symptoms.

          -  Non-specific rises in auto antibodies e.g. rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody
             etc. will not be used to exclude individuals from the study.

          -  Patients with co-morbid disease that in the opinion of the investigators gives them an
             expected life expectancy of less than one year will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients involved in clinical trials assessing novel IPF therapies will be excluded
             from enrolment in this study.
