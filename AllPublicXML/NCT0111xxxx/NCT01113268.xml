  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main goal is to create a prospective cohort of 1500 patients with a first large
      myocardial infarction allowing us, in a second step, to identify susceptibility genes for the
      progression of patients towards chronic heart failure using a candidate gene/candidate
      pathway approach. Our main hypothesis is that there is, for a given initial biomechanical
      stress (duration of the ischemic episode, size of the infarcted area, etc.), a variation in
      the individual susceptibility to develop left ventricular remodelling and to progress towards
      heart failure, and that this variation is linked to genetic variants between individuals.

      The research program comprises 4 phases: a selection phase at D0-D1, a pre-inclusion and an
      inclusion phase at D4±2, a visit at M6, and a 5 year follow up phase.

      Visit at Day 0 - Day 1:

        -  The first 12-lead ECG, to be included in the observation book, is performed.

        -  The first blood sample is taken.

      Visit at Day 4±2:

        -  The first transthoracic echocardiography is performed in all patients selected.

        -  In the presence of at least 3 akinetic LV segments at the transthoracic
           echocardiography, the patient is included.

        -  Demographic data, medical and surgical anteriority, detailed circumstances of occurrence
           of the MI and any other relevant information is obtained during an interview.

        -  The second 12-lead ECG is performed.

        -  The second blood sample is taken.

        -  The first MRI is performed (optional)

      Visit at 6 months:

        -  The second transthoracic echocardiography is performed.

        -  The third 12-lead ECG is performed.

        -  The third blood sample is taken.

        -  A 24-hour Holter-ECG monitoring is performed (optional)

        -  The second MRI is performed (optional)

      Five year follow up:

      Each patient included at day 4±2 will be contacted by phone 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-MI to
      obtain information regarding cardiovascular events and hospitalizations. If the patient
      cannot be contacted directly, we will try to contact a member of his/her family or his/her
      family physician.
