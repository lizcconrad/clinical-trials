      The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of maternal teenage on pregnancy and
      perinatal outcomes among Caucasian pregnant women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the past decade in the United States, approximately 10 percent of teenage girls from
      15 to 19 became pregnant. According to the National Vital Statistics Report 2009 seventy of
      one thousand births in the United States accounted to teenagers from 15 to nineteen years of
      age during in 2005 and fell to forty per 1,000 women in 2006. In contrary, the overall
      teenage birth rate lay at twenty- two per 1,000 births in Massachusetts in 2007 ranging from
      seventy to thirteen per 1,000 women for Hispanic vs. white women aged 15- 19 years. Central
      European data showed equal results for teenage pregnancy birth rates. According to the German
      National Institute of Vital Statistics thirty-four of one thousand births in Germany
      accounted to teenagers younger than 20 years of age. This pattern is a source of concern
      since teenage mothers have an increased risk of having low-birth- weight babies, premature
      babies, and babies who die during the first year of life. Additionally, teenage mothers are
      more likely to suffer from other concomitant pregnancy diseases such as preeclampsia or
      anemia.

      Furthermore, teenage mothers are more likely than older mothers to be poor, less well
      educated, non- white, unmarried and they are less likely to have received early prenatal
      care. Dealing with pregnant adolescents therefore means a great challenge in modern
      obstetrics. Previous research has shown racial differences as well as weight differences for
      increased risk of adverse prenatal outcome among African Americans and teenagers. Taking into
      account the impact of race on pregnancy outcomes, our goal was to examine the relationship of
      young maternal age on obstetrical outcomes in a predominantly Caucasian central European
      teenaged population.
