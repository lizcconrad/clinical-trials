      The primary purpose is to study the predictive value of preserved nociceptors and large
      afferent fibers and dynamic mechanical allodynia on the effect of lidocaine patch. The
      primary outcome measure is the predictive role for these three measures for obtaining a
      response to lidocaine. A responder is defined as a person with at least a 2-point pain
      reduction to lidocaine (change in median pain intensity (measured on a 10 point numeric
      rating scale) of pain from the baseline week to the last week of lidocaine treatment).
      Secondary effect variable will be efficacy of lidocaine on pain reduction (baseline week
      versus last week of each treatment) and pain relief (complete, good, moderate, slight, none,
      or worse) for spontaneous and evoked pain, and effect on ongoing pain, brush evoked
      allodynia, cold and warm allodynia, and pinprick hyperalgesia evaluated on each visit.
