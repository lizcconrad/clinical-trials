  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study was that acupuncture in conjunction with standard care of
      pulmonary rehabilitation improves outcome measures compared to pulmonary rehabilitation
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation is recognized as a pivotal component in International Guidelines for
      the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In patients with COPD,
      clinical research using acupuncture has reported a significant reduction in the use of
      medications, decrease breathlessness and increased functional capacity. To our knowledge,
      this is the first time that these two treatments were combined to compare functional,
      physiological, biological and emotional/QOL outcomes in this cohort of patients.
