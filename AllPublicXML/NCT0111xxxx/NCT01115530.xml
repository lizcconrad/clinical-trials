      In this study we will evaluate whether the addition of a formal lower extremity resistance
      exercise training program and/or a nutritional supplement will improve the functional
      recovery of older adult veterans participating in a geriatric rehabilitation program for
      deconditioning. Specifically, subjects admitted to a geriatric inpatient rehabilitation
      program with a diagnosis of deconditioning will be randomly assigned to one of four groups;
      1) Control/standard rehabilitation program, 2) Standard rehabilitation plus resistance
      exercise twice per week, 3) Standard rehabilitation plus a daily nutritional supplement, 4)
      Standard rehabilitation plus the resistance exercise and the nutritional supplement. Subjects
      will participate in each program for 12 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study we will
      measure lower extremity strength, walking speed, and overall function (using the standardized
      Functional Independence Measure), and compare the changes in each group.
