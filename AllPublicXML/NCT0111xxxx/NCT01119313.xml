        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  men and women aged 18 years or older;

          -  two comparable treatment areas (difference in local SCORAD not greater than 3) on
             opposite extremities of 100 - 300 cm2 with at least one lesional region within each of
             these areas of ≥ 20 cm². Clinical condition of atopic eczema mild to moderate defined
             by a local SCORAD of at least 5 with

               1. erythema ≥ 2

               2. lichenification ≥ 1

               3. dryness ≥ 1

               4. itching ≥ 1

          -  Erlangen atopy score sum equal or higher than 10 points (3);

          -  the physical examination must be without disease findings unless the investigator
             considers an abnormality to be irrelevant to the outcome of the study;

          -  female patients of childbearing potential must either be surgically sterile
             (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or agree to use a reliable method of contraception
             with a failure rate of less than 1 % per year when used consistently and correctly
             such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intra uterine
             devices [IUDs], sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner;

          -  written informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  acne, suntan, eczema, hyperpigmentation or tattoos in the test areas;

          -  dark-skinned persons whose skin color prevents ready assessment of skin reactions;

          -  evidence of drug or alcohol abuse;

          -  pregnancy or nursing;

          -  UV-therapy within 6 weeks before first treatment;

          -  symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may influence the outcome of the
             study in the four weeks before and during the study;

          -  participation in the treatment phase of another clinical study within the last four
             weeks prior to the first administration of investigational drug in this study;

          -  known allergic reactions to components of the study preparations, hypersensitivity
             against cetostearyl alcohol;

          -  treatment with systemic or locally acting medications which might counter or influence
             the study aim (e.g. antihistamines or glucocorticosteroids) within two weeks before
             study day 1and throughout the study period (exception: asthma may be found in patients
             with atopic eczema, therefore inhalation with corticosteroids in patients with asthma
             accompanying atopic eczema will be allowed at a dose not exceeding 1 mg/day. The
             dosage should remain constant throughout the study period);

          -  contraindications according to summary of product characteristics;

          -  in the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             patient should not participate in the study, e.g. due to probable noncompliance or
             inability to understand the study and give adequately informed consent;

          -  patient is institutionalized because of legal or regulatory order
