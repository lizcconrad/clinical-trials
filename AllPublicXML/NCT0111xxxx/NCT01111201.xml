  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study also aims to raise awareness among both patients and health-care providers about
      the importance of pre-travel health consultation and preventive interventions prior to
      international travel.

      Through appropriate health counseling, cancer patients will have less risk of having travel
      -related health complications and thus have a better quality of life and overall improved
      sense of wellbeing.

    <description>There will be four versions of the questionnaire, each slightly modified to be more specific toward the treatment paradigms in the respective target patient population (Breast Cancer/ Lymphoma/Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant/ Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant). All questionnaire versions will consist of seven sections.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a self-administered anonymous questionnaire that is voluntarily completed by the patient. Questions in Section One will cover general information about the patient including gender, age, race, country of birth, current zip code of residence, and level of education. Questions in Section Two will cover information regarding the cancer (breast/lymphoma) or transplant (allogeneic/ autologous). Questions in Section Three will cover travel history including the frequency of travel outside the United States and Canada in the last 5 years. Questions in Sections Four through Seven will obtain information about their last trip outside the United States and Canada.</description>
