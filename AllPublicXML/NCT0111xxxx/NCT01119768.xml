    <measure>Symptom Control Rate at 24 Weeks Assessed by Gerd Q Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>GerdQ Scores ranging from 0 to 3 were applied for the positive predictors and from 3 to 0 (reversed order, where 3 = none) for negative predictors. The GerdQ score was calculated as the sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. When GerdQ ≥8, the patients could be symptom based diagnosed as GERD. GerdQ was consisted of 3 categories: A, B and C. Each category has two questions with sum of score ranging from 0 to 6. Symptom controlled was defined as patients with all items ≤1 in A and C category of GerdQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Success Rate in Whole Study Duration.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Success is defined as patients with symptom relief after 8 weeks or 2 weeks esomeprazole treatment, and also get symptom controlled during maintenance treatment / follow-up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Relapse.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 24 weeks after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first relapse is from the last dose during the treatment period to date of first time patient comes to the investigator due to symptom recure and need for treatment.
Time to first relapse is actually the time when 50% of patients had relapse. Up to the end of study, there were less than 50% of the patients in arm esomeprazole 2 weeks group had relapse so was unable to compute this endpoint</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Relief Rate in 2 Treatment Regimens.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks for arm 1, 2 weeks for arm 2</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom relief is defined as no more than 1 day of mild symptoms of GERD during previous 7 days after 8 weeks or 2 weeks of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Relief Rate After 2 Weeks and 8 Weeks in 8 Weeks Treatment Group.</measure>

        <title>Symptom Control Rate at 24 Weeks Assessed by Gerd Q Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>GerdQ Scores ranging from 0 to 3 were applied for the positive predictors and from 3 to 0 (reversed order, where 3 = none) for negative predictors. The GerdQ score was calculated as the sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. When GerdQ ≥8, the patients could be symptom based diagnosed as GERD. GerdQ was consisted of 3 categories: A, B and C. Each category has two questions with sum of score ranging from 0 to 6. Symptom controlled was defined as patients with all items ≤1 in A and C category of GerdQ.</description>

        <title>Symptom Control Rate at 8 Weeks Assessed by Gerd Q Questionnaire</title>
        <description>GerdQ Scores ranging from 0 to 3 were applied for the positive predictors and from 3 to 0 (reversed order, where 3 = none) for negative predictors. The GerdQ score was calculated as the sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. When GerdQ ≥8, the patients could be symptom based diagnosed as GERD. GerdQ was consisted of 3 categories: A, B and C. Each category has two questions with sum of score ranging from 0 to 6. Symptom controlled was defined as patients with all items ≤1 in A and C category of GerdQ.</description>
