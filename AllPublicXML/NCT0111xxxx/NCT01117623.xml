          <title>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration After Single Dose Administration Divided by Dose (Cmax/D)</title>
          <description>Cmax/D refers to the highest measured drug concentration after a single dose administration, which is then divided by the administered dose. It is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples at various times after dosing, and measuring them for drug content.</description>

It is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples at various times after dosing, and measuring them for drug content.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected on Cycle 2, Day 1 and on Cycle 3, Day 1 for expansion cohort. Samples were drawn at the following time points: 0 h pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 24h post-dose</time_frame>
        <population>Pharmacokinetic population; Number of Participants with an evaluable AUC(0-24)ss/D in at least one analyte were 6 in 40mg; 6 in 100 mg; 2 in 120 mg; 3 in 140 mg; 0 in HCC Child Pugh A; 1 in HCC Child Pugh B; 5 in NSCLC</population>

        <title>Tumor Progression in Dose Escalation Cohort</title>
        <description>Tumor progression evaluates changes in a tumor or tumors over time due to worsening of disease. Measurements and observations of the tumor status were performed before, during and after treatment. Progression for solid tumors was evaluated based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) criteria. Tumor dimensions were measured in millimeters and the longest diameter (LD) was recorded for up to 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions total. A sum of the LD for all target lesions was recorded. The use of a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions from the smallest sum or appearance of a new lesion was assessed as progression of disease.</description>
