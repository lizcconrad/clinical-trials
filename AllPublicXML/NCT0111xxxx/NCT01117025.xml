    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the comparative evaluation of systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      lowering, atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence and clinical data in patients with
      paroxysmal/persistent AF and resistant hypertension, undergoing AF ablation alone or combined
      with percutaneous renal denervation.

    <description>The left atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) are explored through a transeptal approach. Real-time 3D LA maps are reconstructed by using a nonfluoroscopic navigation system. The ipsilateral left and right PVs are encircled in one lesion line by circumferential PV isolation. Radiofrequency energy is delivered at 43°C, 35 W, 0.5 cm away from the PV ostia at the anterior wall, and is reduced to 43°C, 30 W, 1 cm away from the PV ostia at the posterior wall, with a saline irrigation speed of 17 mL/min. Each lesion is ablated continuously until the local potential amplitude decreased by &gt;80% or RF energy deliveries exceeded 40 s. The endpoint of circumferential PV isolation is PV isolation. Additional ablation lines are created by connecting the left inferior PV to the mitral annulus (mitral isthmus) and the roof of the LA between the two superior PVs. After the end of the procedure the implantable loop recorder is implanted in the parasternal area of the chest.</description>

    <description>The procedure of AF ablation is the same like in the circumferential PV isolation.
After AF ablation procedure, the angiogram of both renal arteries is performed via femoral access. After that the treatment catheter is introduced into each renal artery and is applied discrete, radiofrequency ablations lasting up to 2 min each and of 8 watts or less to obtain up to six ablations separated both longitudinally and rotationally within each renal artery. During ablation, the catheter system monitored tip temperature and impedance, altering radiofrequency energy delivery in response to a predetermined algorithm. After the procedure the control arterial angiogram should be done.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic drug-refractory AF (with history of failure of ≥2 class I or III
             antiarrhythmic drugs) in patients referred for catheter ablation of AF

             spontaneous termination. PersAF was defined as lasting more than 7 days before being
             terminated pharmacologically or by electrical cardioversion.

          -  Office-based systolic blood pressure of ≥160 mm Hg, despite treatment with ≥3
             antihypertensive drugs (including 1 diuretic)

          -  A glomerular filtration rate ≥45 mL/min/1⋅73 m2, with modification of diet using a
             renal disease formula

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous atrial fibrillation ablation

          -  Type 1 of diabetes mellitus

          -  Structural heart disease

          -  Secondary cause of atrial hypertension

          -  Severe renal artery stenosis or renal arteries abnormalities

          -  Previous operations on renal arteries

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Previous heart, kidney, liver, or lung transplantation
