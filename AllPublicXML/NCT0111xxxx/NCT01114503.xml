  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of otelixizumab in
      patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (thyroid eye disease). There is currently no alternative
      therapy available for this condition other than treatment with steroids, or radiotherapy and
      surgery. The study also includes a comparison of the current steroid treatment,
      methylprednisolone, with the proposed new otelixizumab treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of otelixizumab, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against the human
      lymphocyte antigen CD3 (a protein found on a certain type of white blood cell). This will be
      an open-label, comparator-controlled, two part study to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of otelixizumab in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). It will also look to see if
      otelixizumab affects GO and how it works compared to methylprednisolone (the standard
      treatment for active GO).

      In Part A, between one and four groups of 5 patients will receive doses of otelixizumab
      administered over 8 days. The first dose level will provide a low cumulative dose, this low
      dose level has been safely administered in previous studies. Safety and clinical response
      data will be reviewed after 8 weeks, if no clinical response is seen and there are no safety
      concerns, the dose of otelixizumab will be increased and a new group of subjects will enter
      Part A. In subsequent groups cumulative medium low, medium high, and high doses of
      otelixizumab may be investigated. However if a clinical response is seen at the lowest dose
      the study will move directly to Part B.

      In Part B, patients will receive either otelixizumab at the dose set from Part A, over 8 days
      (5 patients) or methylprednisolone weekly for 12 weeks (5 patients). All dosing will be by
      intravenous infusion. All participants will undergo long term safety evaluation for 48
      months.

      Key assessments include vital signs, 12-lead ECG, liver function tests, thyroid function,
      viral monitoring, monitoring of cortisol and ACTH levels, laboratory safety tests and adverse
      event (side effect) data. Assessment of GO severity will be evaluated using recommended
      assessments including clinical activity assessments and quality of life questionnaires.
      Measurements of exploratory biomarkers (proteins found naturally in the blood) are also
      included in this study.

    <description>The assessment of CD3/TCR complex saturation and modulation was planned to be assessed on Day (1-8) pre dose, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 24. The extent of modulation was to be determined by the extent of TCR alpha beta (αβ) expression which was proportional to the combined levels of free CD3 sites and bound otelixizumab to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Bound levels of otelixizumab was planned to be determined by using flow cytometry method using an anti Immunoglobulin (Ig) antibody. The molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF) of the anti-Ig antibody was to be used to quantify the levels of bound otelixizumab present on T cells. Free otelixizumab binding sites (i.e., sites not occupied by otelixizumab administered to the participants) was to be detected by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled otelixizumab. This endpoint was not analyzed due to the early termination of the study and since only 2 participants were recruited.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at a single center in United Kingdom from 23 June 2010 to 29 August 2012.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 2 participants were randomized in cohort A1 of the study. The study was early terminated due to the need of better understanding of an efficacious dose with otelixizumab from other clinical studies.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Otelixizumab Cohort A1</title>
          <description>Eligible participants received a total intravenous (IV) dose of otelixizumab 3.1 milligram (mg) for 8 days. The planned dosing regimen was 0.1 mg on Day 1, 0.2 mg on Day 2, 0.3 mg on Day 3, 0.5 mg on Day 4 to Day 8. The study medication was administered each day for 2 hours (h). The rate of infusion was 0.05 milligram per hour (mg/h) on Day 1, 0.1 mg/h on Day 2, 0.15 mg/h on Day 3, 0.25 mg/h on Day 4 to Day 8. At the start of each cohort in Part A, 2 participants acted as sentinel participants and complete dosing (Days 1–8) before further participants were dosed with otelixizumab. The first sentinel participants completed all of their dosing days and there was a minimum of 24 h elapse before the second sentinel participant started the dosing regimen. Further participants commenced dosing with otelixizumab once 24 h elapsed from the second sentinel participant receiving the final dose of otelixizumab on Day 8. Subsequent participants were dosed concurrently.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants received a IV dose of otelixizumab 3.1 mg for 8 days. The planned dosing regimen was 0.1 mg on Day 1, 0.2 mg on Day 2, 0.3 mg on Day 3, 0.5 mg on Day 4 to Day 8. The study medication was administered each day for 2 h. The rate of infusion was 0.05 mg/h on Day 1, 0.1 mg/h on Day 2, 0.15 mg/h on Day 3, 0.25 mg/h on Day 4 to Day 8. At the start of each cohort in Part A, 2 participants acted as sentinel participants and complete dosing (Days 1–8) before further participants were dosed with otelixizumab. The first sentinel participants completed all of their dosing days and there was a minimum of 24 h elapse before the second sentinel participant started the dosing regimen. Further participants commenced dosing with otelixizumab once 24 h elapsed from the second sentinel participant receiving the final dose of otelixizumab on Day 8. Subsequent participants were dosed concurrently.</description>

Bound levels of otelixizumab was planned to be determined by using flow cytometry method using an anti Immunoglobulin (Ig) antibody. The molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF) of the anti-Ig antibody was to be used to quantify the levels of bound otelixizumab present on T cells.

Deterioration was defined by worsening by same quantity (as for improvement) of the same measures. Baseline was referred to assessment on Day 1 (pre dose). Change from Baseline was defined as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.

            <description>Eligible participants received a IV dose of otelixizumab 3.1 mg for 8 days. The planned dosing regimen was 0.1 mg on Day 1, 0.2 mg on Day 2, 0.3 mg on Day 3, 0.5 mg on Day 4 to Day 8. The study medication was administered each day for 2 h. The rate of infusion was 0.05 mg/h on Day 1, 0.1 mg/h on Day 2, 0.15 mg/h on Day 3, 0.25 mg/h on Day 4 to Day 8. At the start of each cohort in Part A, 2 participants acted as sentinel participants and complete dosing (Days 1–8) before further participants were dosed with otelixizumab. The first sentinel participants completed all of their dosing days and there was a minimum of 24 h elapse before the second sentinel participant started the dosing regimen. Further participants commenced dosing with otelixizumab once 24 h elapsed from the second sentinel participant receiving the final dose of otelixizumab on Day 8. Subsequent participants were dosed concurrently.</description>
