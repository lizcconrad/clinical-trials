      Background:

        -  Children with brain tumors often have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to see if
           the tumor has responded to therapy or to see if the tumor has grown. Sometimes, it is
           difficult to tell if the scan is abnormal because of tumor size or shape, swelling, scar
           tissue, or dead tissue. Because brain tumor biopsies require surgery, researchers are
           looking for more noninvasive ways of evaluating brain tumors.

        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) scans use a radioactive sugar known as 18F-FDG to try
           to determine if a tumor is active or not. Active tumors generally take up more sugar
           than the surrounding tissue, but because normal brain tissue uses the same sugar as
           brain tumors, it is then difficult to tell if tumor tissue is taking up sugar or not. A
           different radioactive agent, 18F-FLT, is now being studied in some adults with different
           kinds of tumors. Researchers are interested in determining whether it is possible to use
           this agent as a marker of tumor activity in children.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and effectiveness of 18F-FLT for pediatric glioma scans.

        -  To compare the results of 18F-FLT studies with studies using the radioactive agents
           18F-FDG and 1H-MRSI.

      Eligibility:

      - Children less than 18 years of age who are having radiation therapy to treat malignant
      gliomas.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have scanning tests before radiation therapy, 1 to 3 weeks after
           radiation therapy, and if researchers suspect that the tumor is growing.

        -  This study will involve three separate imaging tests (1H-MRSI, 18F-FDG PET, and 18F-FLT
           PET).

        -  Proton spectroscopy (1H-MRSI) is a procedure that is similar to MRI and is performed in
           the same scanner as an MRI. Because this scan is long (2-3 hours), most children will
           receive medications from an anesthesiologist so that they can sleep through the
           procedure.

        -  Within 2 weeks of the 1H-MRSI scan, participants will have the PET scans with both the
           standard contrast agent (18F-FDG) and the experimental agent (18F-FLT). These scans will
           last approximately 1 hour each.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  A limitation of current investigational therapy for patients with brain tumors is
           assessment of response.

        -  (18)F-FDG PET is commonly used to assess tumor metabolism. However, normal brain uses
           glucose as an energy source, resulting in increased background FDG uptake, which
           confounds results and makes it difficult to distinguish normal from neoplastic activity.

        -  Newer imaging techniques that noninvasively assess metabolic and physiologic
           characteristics of brain tumor tissue are being developed to identify biomarkers of
           clinical efficacy in trials of new molecularly targeted agents.

        -  (18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT) is a PET radiopharmaceutical that is taken up by
           proliferating cells and may therefore serve as a surrogate marker of early response or
           lack of response to treatment.

        -  This study will prospectively evaluate (18)F-FLT in children undergoing radiation
           therapy for gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objectives:

        -  Determine the feasibility of (18)F-FLT PET imaging in pediatric patients with malignant
           gliomas

        -  Determine the ability of (18)F-FLT PET imaging to detect treatment changes in pediatric
           patients with malignant gliomas undergoing radiation therapy

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity profile of PET imaging using (18)F-FLT in pediatric
           patients with malignant gliomas

        -  To correlate changes in (18)F-FLT PET before and after radiation with outcome (12 month
           PFS)

        -  To compare the performance of (18)F-FLT-PET to that of MR perfusion, proton magnetic
           resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRSI) and (18)F-FDG PET in prediction of tumor response, time
           to progression and overall survival time.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Children less than 18 years of age with malignant gliomas for whom radiation therapy is
           prescribed.

        -  Adequate organ function defined as:

             -  Hepatic: SGOT, SGPT less than 5 times the ULN; total and direct bilirubin less than
                or equal to 2 times the ULN

             -  Renal: Serum creatinine must be within the upper limit of normal values

        -  Fasting serum glucose less than 150 mg/dL

        -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential

      DESIGN:

      -Patients will undergo MRI (with 1H-MRSI and perfusion), (18)F-FLT PET and (18)F-FDG PET
      within 2 weeks of each other at the following time points: pre-radiation therapy, 1-3 weeks
      post-radiation therapy, and at the time of suspected progression.

          -  Diagnosis: Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of a malignant glioma for which
             radiation therapy is prescribed. Patients with DIPG or optic pathway gliomas are
             exempt from this requirement and do not require a histologic diagnosis. All patients
             must have evaluable (not necessarily measurable) disease.

             dose)

          -  All patients or their legal guardians must sign a document of informed consent
             indicating their awareness of the investigational nature and risks of this study.

          -  Organ Function: Patients must have adequate organ function defined as:

        Hepatic: SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT less than 5 times the ULN, Total bilirubin less than or equal
        to 2 times the ULN

        Renal: Serum creatinine within the upper limit of normal values for age

        Serum Glucose: less than 150 mg/dL

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test

          -  Patients must be able to undergo both the FLT and FDG PET without the use of general
             anesthesia.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             presence of a metallic implant that is not MRI compatible)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded because of known harmful effects of radiation on the fetus
             and the unknown effects of strong magnetic fields and Gadolinium contrast agents on
             the fetus.

          -  Any patient with a history of severe reaction (requiring medication) to Gd-DTPA, FDG
             or FLT.

          -  Any patient with permanent dental hardware, which, in the judgment of the Principal
             Investigator, would interfere with obtaining spectroscopy in the area of the tumor.

          -  Any patient who has begun an investigational agent within 48 hours prior to receiving
             (18)F-FLT.
