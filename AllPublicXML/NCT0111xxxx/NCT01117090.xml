      The purpose of this feasibility study is to record cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signatures from
      subjects who have an implanted drug infusion system and who undergo clinical tests designed
      to troubleshoot possible catheter-related problems as part of their normal standard of care.
      Signatures will be correlated with physician-determined catheter status.
