    <textblock>
      This PHRC is centred on the intestinal epithelial dysplasia ( DEI) or &quot; tufting enteropathy &quot;
      or TE the clinical and histo-pathological descriptions of which are specified well to the
      digestive plan(shot).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this PHRC are:

        -  the phenotypic analysis of the intestinal epithelial dysplasia by clinical and
           histo-pathological investigations.

        -  the identification of proteins involved at the intestinal level in the differentiation,
           the proliferation and the membership of the epithelial cells

        -  from the phenotypic study, a genetic analysis of type maps by homozygote on the whole
           genome partner in an approach guided by possible candidate genes

        -  the study of the genes, chosen according to their location, to their profile of
           expression, and to their function in touch with the pathogenic hypotheses

        Inclusion criteria :

        Patient sent in the service of Gastroenterology Pediatric Hepatology of the Hospital Necker
        Enfants Malades for an intestinal transplantation, from 0 to 15 years old presenting:

          -  A known epithelial dysplasia (Diagnosis established on the clinical and
             histo-morphological criteria from one or several intestinal biopsies, with or without
             diagnosis known or suspected in the family). The objectives are the phenotypic
             characterization of the case and the revealing of markers characteristic
             immuno-histochemistry which can be of use to the diagnosis and direct to candidate
             genes

          -  Or a suspicion of dysplasia epithelial (compatible clinical History(Story) with or
             without extra-digestive demonstrations(appearances) of type keratinate punctuated
             superficial (KPS), abnormalities cutanea or atresia CHOANS with atypical digestive
             histology and without diagnosis known in the family). The objectives are the diagnosis
             on the basis of the immuno-histochemistry expression and the existence of an
             infringement(achievement) conjunctival and the phenotypic characterization of the case

          -  The lit(enlightened) and written consent of both holders of the parental authority
             must be beforehand obtained as well as that of the patient if it is in age to
             understand(include).

        Exclusion criteria :

          -  Not membership in a national insurance scheme (beneficiary or legal successor)

          -  Family not understanding(including) French

          -  Refusal of one of both relatives(parents)
