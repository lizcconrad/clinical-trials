    <textblock>
      This is an open label-pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of a novel
      cholesterol-lovastatin topical solution in children with rare syndromic ichthyoses. Often
      times, these children have difficulty in finding easily applied treatments to make their
      psoriasiform and ichthyotic plaques more manageable. We propose the use of a
      cholesterol-lovastatin topical solution as a treatment option with the hypothesis that it
      will lead to regression of involved areas and decreased erythema and warty-like appearance of
      the plaques. We plan to enroll children with syndromic ichthyoses over the age of 1 year for
      a 12 month study with a total of 5 visits and 5 phone calls.
