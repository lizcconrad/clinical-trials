      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying at biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      stage I or stage III endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify microRNA expression patterns associated with lymph node metastasis in
           samples from patients with endometrial cancer.

      OUTLINE: Banked tumor tissue specimens are analyzed for microRNA expression profiling by
      microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR assays.
