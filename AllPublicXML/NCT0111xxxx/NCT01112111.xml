  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the efficacy of a novel stimulation protocol with the
      conventional low dose step-up and step down regimens in older than 30 years PCOS patients
      undergoing in vitro fertilisation. The novel regime was proposed under the basis of the
      combined effectiveness of the two standard protocols to induce a uniform follicular growth
      and forms a continuation to the author's previously published results examining a similar
      approach in younger PCOS candidates. In total 225 patients have been recruited for this
      study. The stimulation protocol will be assigned under the basis of prospective randomization
      using sealed and numbered envelopes. All patients will be down regulated using a
      desensitisation agent administered on day 2 of spontaneous or induced withdrawal bleeding.
      The initial dosage in the low dose step-up regimen (group A) will be 150 IU/d of FSH for the
      first 6 days followed by an increase of 75 IU thereafter. In the step-down regimen (group B)
      patients will administer a starting dose of 300 IU/d of FSH for the first 3 days followed by
      a decrease to 225 IU/d for the next 3 days. This dosage will be further decreased to 150 IU/d
      or sustained at 225 IU (according to the initial response) until the day of the hCG
      injection. Group C, patients received 225 IU on day 1 followed by a decrease to 150 IU on day
      2. On day 3 the dosage will be increased back to 225 IU. This alternation of injection dosage
      will be followed until day 6. According to the initial ovarian response the dosage will be
      sustained at 225 IU/d or 150 IU/d until the day of the hCG injection. The 10,000 IU hCG will
      be administered when at least two follicles had reached a mean diameter of 18 mm and the
      serum E2 levels were consistent with the ultrasound findings. Egg retrieval will be
      undertaken at 35 hours after the administration of the hCG injection. Oocytes recovered will
      be inseminated 4 hours post egg collection. Patients will receive 3 embryos on the third day
      of development. The luteal phase will be supported by progesterone suppositories starting on
      the day of the egg collection. A positive outcome will be detected by a serum Î²-hCG analysis
      13 days after embryo replacement. The presence of a fetal heart pulse on ultrasound 3 weeks
      later confirmed a clinical pregnancy.

        PCOS is defined as the presence of polycystic ovaries, described as enlarged under US with
        more than 10 cysts (2 and 8 mm) in mean diameter and symptoms of oligomenorhrea/ amenorhea,
        high LH/FSH ratio, obesity, hyperandrogenism hirsuitism and acnes), and withdrawal bleeding
        after administration of progesterone. All women had either failed to ovulate after
        receiving a maximum daily dosage of 100-150 mg of clomiphene citrate for 5 days or failed
        to conceive after at least three ovulatory cycles using CC or gonadotropin treatment. Other
        inclusion criteria included: patients between 30 and 36 years old with patent fallopian
        tubes, no previous IVF attempts, and nortmo-spermic partners.
