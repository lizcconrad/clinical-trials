      A comparison of changes in bone density following the same bone-health plan, but with a
      different bone-health supplement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The US Surgeon General's Report on Bone Health suggests America's bone-health is in jeopardy
      and issued a &quot;call to action&quot; to develop bone-health plans that:

        1. improve nutrition,

        2. increase health literacy and,

        3. increase physical activity.

      The purpose of this study was to use a comparative effective research model to compare
      6-month changes in bone mineral density (BMD)in two study groups. Both followed the same bone
      health plan that contained the three components listed above with the same plant-source
      calcium supplement, but enhanced with different levels of calcium, vitamin D3, vitamin K and
      magnesium.

    <description>Measurements of bone mineral density were conducted at baseline and 6 months from baseline in two different study groups following the same bone-health behavior modification plan, but with different versions of a bone-health calcium supplement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A comparison of changes from baseline in 43-blood chemistry panel and a self-reported quality of life inventory in both study groups</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Study subjects in both arms of the study completed a fasting 43-blood chemistry panel and an 84-item self-reported quality of life inventory at baseline and again after participating in the study for six months. No significant differences were found in the within-group changes from baseline or between the groups on both sets of measures.</description>
