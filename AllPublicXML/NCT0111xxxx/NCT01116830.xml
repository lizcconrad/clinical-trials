  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study will assess the effect
      on biomarkers measures of cognitive dysfunction, the clinical efficacy and safety of
      RO4917838 in participants with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Participants will
      be randomized to receive either RO4917838 (10 milligrams [mg] daily orally) or placebo for 6
      weeks, in addition to their stable antipsychotic medication. Anticipated time on study
      treatment is 6 weeks.
