  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of acetaminophen 650 mg
      and acetaminophen 1000 mg in dental surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess the relative efficacy of acetaminophen 1000 mg versus acetaminophen
      650 mg over a six-hour period, in subjects experiencing at least moderate post-operative
      dental pain.

    <measure>Overall Analgesic Efficacy - Sum of Pain Intensity Difference and Pain Relief Scores Over Six Hours (SPRID6)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference and Pain Relief Scores Over Six Hours (SPRID6) - pain intensity and pain relief were evaluated using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 100 = very severe pain for pain intensity and 0 = no relief and 100 = complete relief for pain relief. For SPRID6, the total possible minimum value is -300 (worst) and the total possible maximum value is 1200 (best). The weights used in the calculation of weighted sums were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point.</description>

        <title>Overall Analgesic Efficacy – Sum of Pain Intensity Difference and Pain Relief Scores Over Six Hours (SPRID6)</title>
        <description>Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference and Pain Relief Scores Over Six Hours (SPRID6) - pain intensity and pain relief were evaluated using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 100 = very severe pain for pain intensity and 0 = no relief and 100 = complete relief for pain relief. For SPRID6, the total possible minimum value is -300 (worst) and the total possible maximum value is 1200 (best). The weights used in the calculation of weighted sums were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point.</description>

        <population>Analysis is based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) set, which included all subjects who were randomized, took study medication, did not vomit within 60 minutes after dosing, and had a baseline pain score and at least one post-randomization assessment.</population>

        <title>Sum of Pain Relief Scores Over Six Hours (TOTPAR6)</title>
        <description>Weighted Sum of the Pain Relief Scores Over Six Hours (TOTPAR6) - pain relief was evaluated using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 = no relief and 100 = complete relief. The total possible minimum value is 0 (worst) and the total possible maximum value is 600 (best). The weights used in the calculation of weighted sums were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point.</description>
        <time_frame>6 Hours</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis is based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) set, which included all subjects who were randomized, took study medication, did not vomit within 60 minutes after dosing, and had a baseline pain score and at least one post-randomization assessment.</population>

        <description>Pain Intensity Difference (PID) from Baseline at Each Assessment Time point - pain intensity was evaluated using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 100 = very severe pain with a highest possible score of 100.

        <description>Pain Intensity Difference (PID) from Baseline at Each Assessment Time point - pain intensity was evaluated using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 = no pain and 100 = very severe pain with a highest possible score of 100.
