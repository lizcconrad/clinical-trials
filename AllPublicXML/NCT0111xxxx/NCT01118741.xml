    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that disulfiram is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
      and may provide benefit for patients with prostate cancer by restoration of tumor suppressor
      genes. Disulfiram is a potent DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor in vitro in our
      laboratory and it was recently found as one of the most potent inhibitors for PCa growth in
      vitro by screening the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. Based on this data, extensive in vitro and
      in vivo studies have been performed to explore its potential antitumor activities in prostate
      PCa. Using both androgen sensitive and insensitive PCa cell lines, we have confirmed that
      disulfiram can demethylate known highly methylated tumor suppressor genes such as APC and
      RARß in PCa cell lines. Disulfiram inhibited PCa cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In
      addition to these new findings, the antitumor activity of disulfiram and its other possible
      mechanisms of action are well documented in literature. Disulfiram has been shown to induce
      apoptosis in a number of cell lines including PCa. A variety of underlying mechanisms of
      anticancer activity have been reported. Disulfiram has been shown to reduce angiogenesis,
      inhibit DNA topoisomerases, inhibit nuclear factor κB, induce p21 and p53 with G1/S cell
      cycle arrest, induce pro-apoptotic redox-related mitochondrial membrane permeabilization,
      inactivate Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase by Cu2+ complexation, inhibit Zn2+-dependent matrix
      metalloproteinases, and prevent tumor invasion or metastasis. The disulfiram analogue
      pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) has been shown to inhibit proteasomal activity in
      combination with copper in human breast and PCa cell lines. Also, disulfiram or its
      metabolites permanently inactivate the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein or reverses
      either MDR1- or MRP1-mediated drug efflux.

    <description>For both of the doses explored (i.e. disulfiram 250 mg PO daily and 500 mg PO daily) the proportion of subjects with a demethylation response was computed. A demethylation response was defined as a &gt;=10% decrease from baseline in global 5-methyl cytosine content as assessed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</description>

          -  There must be a confirmed rise in PSA shown by 2 PSA values at least 1 week apart,
             higher than a reference value noted within 12 months of study entry. Interim PSA
             values during the immediate pre-study 12-month interval may demonstrate a
             &quot;fluctuation&quot; including a decline; however the study baseline PSA must have show a
             rise within the pre-study 12-months period. Baseline PSA must be determined within 4

        <description>For both of the doses explored (i.e. disulfiram 250 mg PO daily and 500 mg PO daily) the proportion of subjects with a demethylation response was computed. A demethylation response was defined as a &gt;=10% decrease from baseline in global 5-methyl cytosine content as assessed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</description>
