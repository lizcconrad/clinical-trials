  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) will use a P300 based brain computer
      interface (BCI) keyboard to type in assistive technology devices. The results of this study
      will be compared with a previous study of a P300 BCI keyboard used by healthy volunteers.

    <measure>Accuracy of Typing With a BCI Keyboard by ALS Patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 times over 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy for the sentence typed in each environment was calculated as the percentage of characters for which the result character matched the target character. The target characters were determined based on the next character needed to complete the sentence to be copied. In the case of errors, the next character was therefore a backspace to correct the error. The target characters were modified by subject comments to account for errors in selecting the next character.
Once sentence was typed in each environment in each session on a separate day. From the three repeated sessions, there were therefore 9 total sentences per subject with 3 measures for each environment. These were treated as repeated measures for the analysis.</description>
