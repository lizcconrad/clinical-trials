  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of sedation using orally
      administered midazolam and promethazine with nitrous oxide/oxygen in uncooperative children
      receiving dental treatments.

    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of oral midazolam in pediatric dentistry is controversial. Usefulness of
      midazolam alone is limited to short-duration procedures, and we are needed to identify safe
      oral conscious regiments which permit longer duration procedures in dental treatments
      especially in Pediatric dentistry.

      Promethazine is a long-acting (4-12 hr) anti-histaminic, H1 antagonist drug which acts as a
      central nervous system depressant and showing itself to be a weak anxiolytic drug.

      The hypothesis to be tested is whether promethazine would improve the patients behavior
      during dental procedures without affecting vital signs, thus enabling longer periods of
      moderate or conscious sedation.
