  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an observational, prospective, multicentric study conducted in a cohort of subjects
      with type 2 diabetes and prescribed with Glucophage XR therapy from hospitals or clinics in
      Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore. Glucophage XR is being used
      in the Asia Pacific region for the treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes. This study was
      designed to provide information on the day to-day experience of using Glucophage XR in the
      management of subjects with type 2 diabetes and its use in routine clinical practice in Asia
      Pacific region.

      Glucophage (metformin) is the standard first line therapy for subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (DM). The consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the
      European Association for the Study of Diabetes has recommended metformin therapy in
      concurrent with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. It has been well accepted that subjects'
      compliance with therapy tends to decrease as the dosage frequency increases and hence the
      regimens should be simplified as far as possible to support good compliance with therapy. The
      use of an extended release formulation of metformin (Glucophage XR) supports the
      simplification of treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes by allowing a once daily
      administration of metformin.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess the tolerability of Glucophage XR therapy when used in routine clinical
           practice in subjects with type 2 diabetes

      Secondary objective:

        -  To assess the effectiveness of Glucophage XR therapy on the maintenance of glycaemic
           control

      The study does not involve any active involvement of the subjects and does not require any
      change from the standard medical management of the subjects. Each subject will be followed
      upon starting Glucophage XR therapy and until at least 12 weeks of treatment or
      discontinuation of treatment, whichever being earlier.
