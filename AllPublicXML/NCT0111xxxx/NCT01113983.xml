    <textblock>
      A single arm, prospective multicenter non-randomized pivotal clinical trial evaluating the
      Edwards SAPIEN XT™ transcatheter heart valve (model 9300TFX), NovaFlex™ transfemoral delivery
      system, Ascendra2™ transapical delivery system and crimper accessories. The trial includes a
      premarket pivotal cohort to evaluate the system performance as well as a post market clinical
      follow-up phase involving long term follow-up of all patients to evaluate the safety of
      investigational devices up to 5 years.

      Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of THV-9300 for patients who have severe
      symptomatic aortic stenosis attributed to calcification and degeneration of a valve leaflet
      and for whom undergoing a surgery safely would be difficult.

      Enrollment: 69 patients Transfemoral approach: 42 patients (No. of patients needed: 23)
      Transapical approach: 27 patients (No. of patients needed: 19)

      Follow-up: Subject data collection will include clinical information at baseline and during
      the index procedure. Subjects will undergo clinical follow-up at discharge, 30 days, 6 months
      and annually for 5 years.

      Clinical sites: Osaka University Hospital Kurashiki Central Hospital Sakakibara Heart
      Institute
