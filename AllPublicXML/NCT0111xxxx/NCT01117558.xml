    <textblock>
      PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive women. It is estimated that 5 to
      10% of women of reproductive age have PCOS. One of the major diagnostic criteria of PCOS was
      chronic anovulation which lead to irregular menstruation, amenorrhea, and infertility; the
      other diagnostic criteria was hyperandrogenism which lead to hirsutism, acne and alopecia.
      Furthermore, PCOS is thought as a metabolic disorder, the long-term consequence of PCOS were
      diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, which are potentially dangerous in women
      health. Early diagnosis and prevention is very important to the PCOS patients.

      Obesity is the most potential risk of threat to health of populations. There is a major
      impact of obesity on the PCOS related disorders. Insulin resistance and distribution of
      adipose tissue were thought to be the important risk factors of cardiovascular and metabolic
      syndrome.

      To treat PCOS patients properly,Wan-Fang hospital had established a specific medical team.
      The investigators recently published in &quot;Fertility and Sterility&quot; about the clinical
      presentation of androgen excess in Taiwanese women. Hirsutism is much less prevalence in
      Taiwanese PCOS women than that previous reported in the Western women. It is important to
      know that some clinical presentation of PCOS might have ethic variance. Insulin resistance
      was reported as another candidate that might have ethic variance.The investigators had
      reported about 40% women in PCOS women were obese, it is similar with previous literature
      reported. Obesity is a major factor that could be controlled during the treatment of
      PCOS.Weight reduction is one of our methods in PCOS treatment. The progressive results for
      obese PCOS women would be facing the risks of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.The
      investigators thought like to evaluate the benefit of weight reduction program to the
      prognosis of obese women with PCOS. Furthermore, it is known that Endothelial progenitor
      cells (EPC) be an early marker of cardiovascular disease, the investigators would like to
      know the role of EPC to predict metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS. Wan-Fang hospital has
      a professional team in PCOS treatment and research which including gynecological
      endocrinologist, cardiologist, medical endocrinologist, specialist in weight reduction. This
      team had been working well for more that 4 years.

      The investigators hope that they can make a contribution to the study and treatment of PCOS
      in Taiwan.
