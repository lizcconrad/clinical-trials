      Hypothesis: Polycaprolactone / Tricalcium Phosphate Orbital (PCL / TCP) Implant is as
      effective in the reconstruction of the Orbital walls as Titanium Mesh implant.

      In this study we will be conducting a randomised trial to compare implants made of 2
      materials for Orbital reconstruction

        -  Polycaprolactone / Tricalcium Phosphate (PCL / TCP)

        -  Titanium

      Patients to be recruited :

        -  80 randomised equally into the 2 groups

        -  age range: 21 - 70

        -  includes orbital wall defects from trauma, after osteotomies

        -  excludes patients with Diabetes Mellitus, known allergies to polycaprolactone &amp; its
           analogues, know allergies to Tricalcium Phosphate &amp; its analogues, infections
           generalised &amp; around the orbital region

      Trial Duration: April 2010 - March 2015

      Follow up:

        -  postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months

        -  Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of Orbits immediate postoperative and at 12 months
           appointment

        -  80 randomised equally into the 2 groups

        -  age range: 21 -70

        -  includes orbital wall defects from trauma confirmed by Computer Tomographic (CT) scans,
           after osteotomies

        -  excludes patients with Diabetes Mellitus, known allergies to polycaprolactone &amp; its
           analogues, know allergies to Tricalcium Phosphate &amp; its analogues, infections
           generalised &amp; around the orbital region

      Trial Duration : April 2010 - March 2015

      Follow up:

        -  postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months

        -  Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of Orbits immediate postoperative and at 12 months
           appointment

        -  all patients will be seen &amp; assessed in the Plastic &amp; Ophthalmology outpatient clinics
           by Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators

      End point :

        -  endpoint for follow-up is 12 months

        -  all patients are assessed for assessed for diplopia, enophthalmos, exophthalmos, visual
           acuity, mobility of the globe, contour symmetry

        -  all patients will have a Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits at 12 months to
           assess the bony orbit &amp; orbital volume

        -  patients will be discharged from follow up at 12 months if asymptomatic

        -  patients with complications will exit the protocol &amp; will be treated on their merits eg.
           infection - removal of implant, etc

      Data Management :

        -  maintained by the Principal Investigator (PI) under repository of the Research &amp;
           Development Office, National Healthcare Group (NHG) / National University Health Systems
           (NUHS), Singapore
