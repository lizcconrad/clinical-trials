    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cardiovascular diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the
      industrialized world. Clinical studies indicate an important role for the proteins of the
      contact activation system (coagulation factor XII (FXII), FXI, prekallikrein and high
      molecular weight kininogen (HMWK)) on the risk of cardiovascular disease. There is
      substantial evidence from mouse studies that FXII and FXI participate in the formation and
      stability of thrombi and in vitro studies showed that collagen is able to activate FXII and
      hereby stimulate thrombin formation and potentiate the formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi.
      The investigators want to determine the role of the proteins of the contact activation system
      in platelet mediated thrombus formation in human blood.

      Objective: The investigators will study the effects of the proteins of the contact activation
      system on platelet mediated thrombus formation, embolization and degradation on collagen in a
      perfusion flow model.

      Study design: Blood will be collected from human volunteers via a venipuncture in the
      forearm. Each volunteer will donate maximally four times 30 ml of blood over a period of two
      days. This blood is used in perfusion flow experiments: blood flows over a coverslip covered
      with collagen in a flow chamber. The investigators will vary several conditions such as the
      concentration of the proteins and the shear rate. For perfusion flow experiments, the
      investigators need fresh whole blood because platelets are viable for four hours. After this
      time, new blood is needed.

      Study population: For this study the investigators need blood from human volunteers with a
      coagulation defect in one of the proteins of the contact activation system, e.g. FXII, FXI,
      prekallikrein or HMWK and controls without any coagulation defects.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The investigators main study endpoint is the ex vivo
      formation of platelet-mediated thrombi on collagen in a perfusion flow model. The
      investigators hypothesize that thrombi formed from blood of patients deficient in FXII or FXI
      are less stable than those formed from blood from controls.
