  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the bioavailability of BI 10773 and of
      warfarin after concomitant multiple oral administration of BI 10773 and a single oral dose of
      warfarin in comparison to BI 10773 and warfarin given alone, and to investigate the
      pharmacodynamics of a single oral dose of warfarin with and without concomitant multiple oral
      administration of BI 10773.
