  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection accounted for the first cause of death in patients after liver transplantation, and
      2 / 3 of the cause of death was fungal infections. The investigators group early found that T
      cell subsets playing a role of inducing immune tolerance were significantly increased in vivo
      of liver transplantation patients with aspergillus infection, which may be a kind of Treg
      cells expressing IL-17. To explore the immune tolerance mechanism induced by the immune
      balance cells is important to liver transplantation patients for improving efficacy and
      reducing the mortality. Therefore, the investigators are going to get the blood sample and
      liver tissue of the liver transplantation patients before and after treatment of aspergillus
      infection, flow cytometry analysis of blood T cell subsets, Cytometric Bead Array to detect
      changes in blood cytokines, laser capture microdissection to obtain liver biopsies of
      inflammatory cells in portal area and further for analysis of T cell subsets and protein. And
      the investigators are also to investigate the characteristics of CCR6 + CD4 + FOXP3 + Treg
      cell clones secreting IL-17 and the capacity of which suppressing conventional T cell
      proliferation. This study may find new methods, such as certain types of T cell subsets or
      cytokines for the treatment of liver transplant patients, which not only to anti-rejection
      but also to reduce fungal infection.
