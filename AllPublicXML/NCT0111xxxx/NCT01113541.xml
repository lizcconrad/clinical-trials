  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of Ziprasidone HCl on the distribution of
      metabolic syndrome (MS) risk factors in a population of Bipolar patients presenting with
      glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and/or elevated waist circumference associated with their
      current antipsychotic medication.

      The trial was terminated prematurely on December 14, 2010, due to inability to recruit the
      planned number of subjects and shifting organizational priorities. The decision to terminate
      the trial was not based on any safety or efficacy concerns.

    <description>C-SSRS is a participant rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, actual attempts (yes or no responses), and intensity of ideation (rated 1=low severity to 5=high severity). Yes/No responses are mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories: Completed suicide, suicide attempt, preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and self-injurious behavior, or no suicidal intent.

             triglycerides (TGs): ≥1.7 mmol/L (≥150 mg/dL); Reduced HDL-Cholesterol: &lt;1.03 mmol/L

             5.6 mmol/L.

          -  According to the clinical judgment of the investigator, the risk factors for MS have
             developed in close temporal relationship to starting an antipsychotic medication.

          -  Substitution to a less metabolically disruptive antipsychotic medication is considered

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with contraindication(s) to the use of Ziprasidone according to Canadian
             prescribing information.

          -  Subjects with a history of treatment resistance.

          -  Subjects with any medical condition (e.g. pre-existing diabetes, pre-existing
             dyslipidemia, thyroid pathology) or taking any concomitant medication (e.g. topiramate
             or other weight loss-promoting agents, hypoglycemic agents, hypolipemic agents), that
             may confound the evaluation of the study drug.

          -  Body mass index ≥ 40 at baseline.
