    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female 18 years old or older.

          -  The subject or subject's legal representative is willing to sign the informed consent.

          -  The subject which preoperative evaluation indicated the need for native or prosthetic
             aortic valve replacement.

          -  Any subject amenable to aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis should be
             enrolled in the study, even in conjunction with valve repair, coronary artery bypass
             grafting and other procedures.

          -  The subject is located in a geographic location that will enable the subject to return
             to the study site for all follow-up examinations (i.e. geographically stable).

          -  Subject will be available to the investigator(s) for postoperative follow-up beyond
             one year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has preexisting valve prosthesis in the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid
             position.

          -  The subject requires a double or multiple valve replacement (a valve repair is not
             considered an exclusion criterion).

          -  The subject has a previously implanted SOLO valve, within the clinical study, that
             requires replacement.

          -  The subject has active endocarditis or myocarditis.

          -  The subject is or will be participating in a concomitant research study of an
             investigational product.

          -  The subject is a minor, drug abuser, alcohol abuser, prison inmate, institutionalized,
             or is unable to give informed consent.

          -  The subject has a major or progressive non-cardiac disease that, in the investigator's
             experience, results in a life expectancy of less than 1 year, or the implant of the
             device produces an unacceptable increased risk to the subject.

          -  The subject is pregnant, planning to become pregnant or lactating.

          -  The subject has a congenital bicuspid aortic valve.

          -  The subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to complete the study.

          -  The subject is undergoing renal dialysis for chronic renal failure or has been
             diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism.

          -  The subject has had an acute preoperative neurological deficit, myocardial infarction,
             or cardiac event that has not returned to baseline or stabilized ≥30 days prior to the
             planned valve implant surgery.

          -  The subject has extensive calcification of the aortic root where removal of the
             calcified tissue cannot be achieved.

          -  The subject has a significantly dilated aortic root that is not surgically corrected.

          -  The subject requires replacement of the aortic root / full root procedure.
