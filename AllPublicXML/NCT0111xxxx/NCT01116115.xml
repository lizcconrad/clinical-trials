      formula on intestinal parameters in term formula fed infants.

      InFatTM is an advanced basic-fat ingredient, which mimics the fat composition and properties
      of human milk fat and enabling optimal intake of the essential calcium and energy (in the
      form of fatty acids) and easy digestion. These benefits are the result of a unique fatty acid
      composition on the glycerol backbone, which ensures high level of palmitic acid at the middle
      (sn-2) position.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high sn-2 palmitic acid based infant
      formula on intestinal parameters, anthropometric parameters and stool characteristics in
      formula fed term infants.

          4. Birth weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA).

          5. The infant is apparently healthy at birth and entry to study.

          6. Apgar after 5 minutes &gt;7

          7. Enrolled within their first 7 days of life

          8. The infant is a product of normal pregnancy and delivery, including C-section.

          9. Parental ability to attend visits and interviews and willing to fill questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mother health condition: (psychological or physical) or socioeconomic problems that
             may interfere with the mother's ability to take care of her infant or according to PI
             discretion may interfere with study results.

          2. The infant suffers from a major congenital abnormality, a disease or chromosomal
             disorder with a clinical significance that can be detected at or around birth.

          3. The infant suffers/ed from a disease requiring mechanical ventilation or medication
             treatment at the first week after birth.

          4. The infant suffers from any suspected or known metabolic or physical limitations
             interfering with feeding or normal metabolism (require a special formula).

          5. The infant or mother was treated with antibiotics around birth.
