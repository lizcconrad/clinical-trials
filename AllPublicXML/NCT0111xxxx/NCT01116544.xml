    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if individuals who had a stroke more than one year
      before entering the study and who remain unable to open their affected hand are better able
      to sense and move their affected arm after 10-15 weeks of treatment with a new robotic
      therapy device (the AMES device) and EMG biofeedback.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 20 years, the discovery of cortical plasticity in the adult human brain has led
      to the development of new therapies to rehabilitate stroke survivors whose recovery of motor
      function has stalled with conventional therapeutic methodology. However, the efficacy of
      these new therapies appears to be limited to relatively high-functioning chronic stroke
      patients. A therapeutic approach that may be efficacious in restoring functional movement to
      low-functioning chronic stroke patients is &quot;AMES,&quot; which stands for Assisted Movement with
      Enhanced Sensation. Despite the efficacy of AMES in restoring movement to low-functioning
      hemiparetic stroke patients, those with plegia at a joint tend not to recover movement in the
      plegic direction with AMES treatment or with other rehabilitation therapies. The objective of
      this study is to determine if AMES treatment in combination with biofeedback can be helpful
      in restoring functional movement to plegic stroke patients.

    <description>The AMES device provides a 30 minute treatment period of alternating passive flexion and then extension of the hand while vibrators vibrate the muscles of the hand. The subjects job is to attempt to assist the device in the movement. A computer screen will provide visual feedback of the amount of EMG activity the subject is able to generate in the hand. This study will examine whether AMES therapy combined with EMG biofeedback can restore hand opening to plegic stroke subjects.</description>

    <description>Each subject will receive 30 sessions of AMES therapy in the clinic. Each session will consist of 10 min of functional testing (i.e., passive motion and strength tests) followed by 30 min of grasp therapy using the AMES device. One group of subjects will receive AMES therapy only with joint torque biofeedback (without EMG feedback), and the other group will receive AMES therapy with EMG biofeedback. While all test subjects should attempt to open the hand when the grasp mechanism is opening and close the hand when the mechanism is closing, the biofeedback information provided to aid a subject will differ for the 2 subject groups.</description>
