  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that mouse cytomegalovirus infection alone can elevate the blood
      pressure in mice. Since HCMV has uniquely evolved with its human host, with little genetic
      similarity to the animal CMV counterparts, and it only replicates in human, an
      epidemiological study is required to define the relevance of HCMV infection and expression of
      hcmv-miRNA-UL112 to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.

      The investigators found that hcmv-miR-UL112, a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded miRNA,
      was highly expressed in the hypertensive patients. Among the top miRNA target predictions,
      the investigators demonstrate that IRF-1 is a direct target gene of hcmv-miR-UL112, along
      with MICB that has been previously reported. Both IRF-1 and MICB play critical roles in
      immuno/inflammatory and anti-infection response. Thus, the investigators speculated that
      IRF-1 and MICB repression by hcmv-miR-UL112 could be considered a unifying mechanism that
      evades the host response at several levels: antiviral, inflammatory, and immune. In addition,
      there is an increasing evidence that IRF-1 may be important in apoptosis, angiogenesis,
      neointima formation and the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. IRF-1 can up-regulate
      angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AGTR2) that exerts antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions
      and affects regulation of blood pressure. It has been reported that the targeted disruption
      of the mouse AGTR2 gene resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure and increased
      sensitivity to angiotensin II. The nitric oxide synthase expression and NO synthesis in
      macrophages and distinct cardiomyocytes are induced and controlled by IRF-1 in response to
      inflammation, important steps in vascular biology that may improve endothelial function and
      inhibit smooth muscle cell migration, and a key pathophysiological event in hypertension.
      Collectively, these reports support a strong relationship between IRF-1 regulation and
      hypertension, indicating a potential role of hcmv-miR-UL112 and HCMV infection in the
      pathogenesis of hypertension.Thus, the investigators want to investigate the potential link
      between HCMV infection and essential hypertension.
