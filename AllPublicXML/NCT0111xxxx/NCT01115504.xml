      The study is performed to consider the effect of thiamine supplementation versus placebo on
      symptoms and signs of patients with heart failure systolic and diastolic function of left
      ventricle.

      Heart failure patients (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%) are randomized to
      receive tablets of 300mg or placebo for 1 months in a double-blind fashion. All subjects will
      be on stable optimal medical therapy according to the present guidelines for at least 3
      months before enrolment. At randomization and at study end, echocardiography by a single
      observer will be performed and assessment of symptoms and signs and quality of life based on
      self scoring system (from 1 to 7) and objective physical examinations will be done.
