  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that patients with gout suffer from chronic inflammation
      of their joints, observable by MRI, even in the absence of symptomatic gouty attacks.
      Secondary end-points of this study will include analyzing the effects of uric acid-lowering
      therapy (specifically with the FDA approved medication Febuxostat) in a subgroup of patients,
      checking for the presence of inflammatory markers to see if there is any correlation with the
      proposed chronic inflammation, and evaluating for other characteristic findings of gout on
      MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical history of untreated gout transitions from an acute intermittent arthritis to a
      chronic inflammatory arthritis. This tells us that at some point the inflammation associated
      with gout does not abate. Our group recently completed an advanced imaging study in patients
      with early gout that suggested nearly 60% of subjects had synovial pannus during
      intercritical gout. This is likely more prevalent in patients with more advanced gout. The
      presence of synovial pannus also likely correlates with serum urate levels. The primary aim
      of this study will be to determine the percentage of patients with known gout who have
      evidence of chronic ongoing synovial-based inflammatory disease, determine the degree of this
      inflammation, and correlate it with their serum urate levels. Secondary endpoints will
      include assessments for the presence of other characteristic findings of gout on these MRI
      (i.e. erosive changes, intraosseous tophi, soft tissue tophi, joint effusion, bone marrow
      edema, and soft tissue edema). We will also be checking serum high-sensitivity CRP levels to
      evaluate for any correlation with synovial pannus, and assess baseline radiographs of the
      &quot;index&quot; joint for the presence of erosive changes, which will be correlated with the presence
      and severity of synovial pannus in that same joint. Analysis will also be performed to see if
      there is a correlation with serum urate levels. A sub-study will be performed assessing the
      effect of aggressive serum urate lowering therapy (specifically with febuxostat [Uloric]) on
      this chronic inflammation; i.e. synovial pannus.

    <description>All study participants: Standard demographics will be obtained including a baseline serum urate, creatinine, and hs-CRP. Study subjects will have their &quot;index joint&quot; determined (the joint that is most often involved with acute attacks of gout in each particular patient). A plain radiograph of the &quot;index joint&quot; will be obtained, as well as an MRI with and without gadolinium enhancement to assess for presence and degree synovial pannus.</description>

    <description>To analyze the effect of urate-lowering therapy (specifically with febuxostat [Uloric]) on the synovial pannus in the &quot;index joint&quot; of a subgroup of patients. Subjects not currently on any urate-lowering therapy, or on a serum urate lowering drug other than febuxostat (Uloric) and who have a serum urate level of &gt; or = to 9.0, will be treated with febuxostat (Uloric) and their serum urate level will be followed at months 1, 3, 6, and 9. MRI (with and without gadolinium) of the same &quot;index joint&quot; will be repeated at month 9 to assess for the presence and degree of synovial pannus. Because initiation of urate-lowering therapy can induce acute attacks of gout, these subjects will also be started on colchicine as a prophylactic (and remain on colchicine for 6 months).</description>
