             primary complaint of sensitive teeth

          -  Three teeth that can be isolated that meet all of the following criteria at the
             screening visit:

          -  Teeth showing signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or
             abrasion. Study teeth must exhibit greater than or equal to 3 mm recession at the
             facial surface midpoint

          -  Teeth having a gingival index score of less than or equal to 2

          -  Teeth with a clinical mobility less than or equal to 1

          -  Teeth that show signs of sensitivity, evaporative (air) sensitive teeth displaying a
             response of greater than or equal to 30 mm on a 100 mm VAS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic disease or other condition that is associated with intermittent episodes of
             constant daily pain, such as arthritis, low back pain, etc.

          -  An condition or medication that causes xerostomia as determined by investigator

          -  Sensitive teeth not expected to respond to treatment with an over-the-counter
             dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Teeth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations

          -  Teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures

          -  Teeth with full crowns, orthodontic bands, extensive caries or cracked enamel

          -  Sensitive teeth with contributing etiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession
             of exposed dentine.

          -  Dental prophylaxis within 3 weeks of the screening visit

          -  Tongue or lip piercing or presence of dental implants

          -  Subjects not using the same brand of toothpaste for at least 4 months prior to the
             screening visit

          -  Subjects who have used desensitizing toothpaste during the 4 weeks before Treatment
             Visit 1

          -  Taking daily dose of medication which may interfere with the perception of pain.
             Examples of such medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that
             cause marked or moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquillizers, mood-altering drugs or
             anti-inflammatory drugs

        <title>Between Treatment Comparison of the Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline of Response to Evaporative (Air) Stimuli Immediately Following Treatment on Day 5 Using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in 5% Potassium Nitrate Solution and 2.5% Potassium Nitrate Solution</title>
        <description>Response to a one second application of air from a standard dental unit syringe applied to the surface of hypersensitive tooth. After each stimuli participant rated the intensity of pain on a 100 millimeter VAS, on which 0 represented &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represented the&quot; worst pain imaginable&quot;. Change from baseline was calculated as mean score at the given time point minus mean score at baseline.</description>

After each stimuli participant rated the intensity of pain on a 100 millimeter VAS, on which 0 represented &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represented the&quot; worst pain imaginable&quot;. Change from baseline was calculated as mean score at the given time point minus mean score at baseline.</description>

          <title>Between Treatment Comparison of the Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline of Response to Evaporative (Air) Stimuli at 20 Mins Post Treatment on Day 5 Using a VAS</title>
          <description>Response to a one second application of air from a standard dental unit syringe applied to the surface of hypersensitive tooth. After each stimuli participant rated the intensity of pain on a 100 millimeter VAS, on which 0 represented &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represented the&quot; worst pain imaginable&quot;. Change from baseline was calculated as mean score at the given time point minus mean score at baseline.</description>
          <population>Intent to treat (ITT) population: All participants who were randomized, receive at least one dose of treatment, and had at least one post baseline efficacy evaluation. There was no imputation for missing data. Analysis population was less than the randomized population because 2 participants had one tooth which was not treated</population>
