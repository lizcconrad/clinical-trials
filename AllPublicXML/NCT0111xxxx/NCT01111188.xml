  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by cell cycle dysregulation. PD 0332991 is a
      cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor capable of inhibiting cell cycling of MCL. A phase
      I study has demonstrated the safety and anti-lymphoma activity of PD 0332991. Bortezomib is a
      first generation proteasome inhibitor approved for treatment of patients with recurrent MCL.
      Preclinical data suggests that PD 0332991 and bortezomib may act synergistically in MCL.

      PD 0332991 will be administered continuously for 12 days followed by a 9 day period without
      treatment. Bortezomib will be administered by intravenous bolus on days 8, 11, 15, and 18 of
      each cycle. One cycle is defined as three weeks. A maximum of ten cycles will be
      administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Escalating doses of PD 0332991 in combination with bortezomib will be studied sequentially,
      with at least 3 patients in each dose level until the MTD is determined. PD 0332991 will be
      given orally, starting on Day 1 of each cycle, once a day for 12 days followed by 9 days
      without treatment. Bortezomib will be given by intravenous (IV) bolus or subcutaneously
      (taking 3 to 5 seconds to administer) on days 8, 11, 15 and 18. For dose levels 3a and 4b,
      bortezomib will be administered only on days 15 and 18. One cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21
      days). Subjects will remain on treatment until they meet criteria for withdrawal from
      treatment described in section 5.4 (e.g., DLT, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent).

      The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt (if applicable), drug preparation, and
      dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers, patients' height, body weight, and body
      surface area, and total drug administered in milliliters and milligrams. Any discrepancy
      between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the discrepancy must be
      recorded in the source documents.

      Treatment will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the
      investigator or identified sub-investigator (s). Treatment will be administered on an
      outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.
      Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6. No investigational or commercial
      agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to
      treat the patient's malignancy.

             be post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of
             birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of the study. Male subjects must agree to use adequate contraception prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a female subject
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

             agents within 4 weeks prior to entering the study unless progression has been
             documented while on treatment, or those who have not recovered from adverse events due
             to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients may be receiving prednisone
             at a maximum dose of 10 mg/day orally, provided the dose has been stable during the
             prior two weeks before starting treatment.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Prior exposure to PD 0332991

          -  Prior exposure to bortezomib will only be permitted if there was a documented complete
             or partial response and progression occurred off therapy

          -  Patients must not have experienced significant hematologic (grade 4) or neuropathic
             toxicities (grade 3 or 4) due to prior bortezomib therapy

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt; = grade 2 (CTCAEv3.0) within 14 days before enrollment.

             requirements.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the risks to an
             unborn fetus or potential risks in nursing infants are unknown. Confirmation that the
             subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum B-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (B-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy

             primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John's Wort).

             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (see Appendix 7), uncontrolled
             angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence
             of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any
             ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the
