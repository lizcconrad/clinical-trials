  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy (ability to provide a beneficial
      treatment of the disease) of pralatrexate for the treatment of female patients with advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer who have failed prior chemotherapy. Patients will receive vitamin
      B12 and folic acid supplementation.
