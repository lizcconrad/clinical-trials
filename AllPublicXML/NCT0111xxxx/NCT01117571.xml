      Study is prospective and multi-center. Study will include 100 to 200 patients across up to 20
      sites.The study sites will be located in the United States.The study objective is to evaluate
      the safety and performance of the ConforMIS iUni® Unicompartmental Knee Resurfacing Device in
      patients with single compartment osteoarthritis.

      The iUni G2 Unicompartmental Resurfacing Device (iUni) is an FDA cleared and CE Marked
      implant designed for patients with damage isolated to either the medial or lateral
      tibiofemoral compartment of the knee. The study subjects will be followed for 10 years post
      implant. The study objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the ConforMIS iUni®
      Unicompartmental Knee Resurfacing Device in patients with single compartment osteoarthritis.
      The iUni is a patient-specific unicompartmental resurfacing device designed from the
      patient's unique anatomy using proprietary software which interprets data from the patient's
      CT scan. The patient matched implant design is then coupled with unique patient-matched
      disposable instrumentation designed using the same CT data and software. The follow-up visit
      schedule will include visits at 6 weeks, 6 months (optional), 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10
      years post implant.The remaining follow-up data collected at years 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 may
      be collected via phone call/email and does not require a subject visit to the site.The study
      sites will be located in the United States.

    <description>The iUni® Unicompartmental Resurfacing Device is an FDA cleared and CE Marked implant designed for patients with damage isolated to either the medial or lateral tibiofemoral compartment of the knee. The patient-specific iUni is designed from a CT scan of an individual patient's knee using a design process which interactively maps the diseased area and defines the extent of misalignment present in the knee. This process allows definition of the shape and size of the femoral and tibial components of the implant, as well as the disposable instrumentation</description>
