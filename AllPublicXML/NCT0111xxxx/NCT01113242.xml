      Cognitive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not as obvious as cognitive disorders in
      Alzheimer disease and their diagnosis tends to be delayed. If neuropsychological assessment
      of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease is well established, the thresholds of cognitive
      testing corresponding to a dementia are unknown. Recently, new diagnosis criteria of dementia
      associated with PD have been proposed by the movement disorder society. In this study two
      groups of patients with idiopathic PD will be separated and compared according to their Mini
      Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (upper or lower than 26). Included patients will have
      clinically idiopathic PD, will be over 65 years old and will present cognitive complain.
      Cognitive and mood disorders as well as motor symptoms will be assessed using validated
      scales and a neuropsychological assessment dispatched in two visits will be performed .
      Differences in the distribution of data from the two groups of patients will be assessed in
      statistically analysis with non parametric tests. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the most effective tests and their threshold value corresponding to a pathological cognitive
      decline.

    <description>Included patients had clinically idiopathic PD, were over 65 years old and presented with a cognitive complain. A detailed registration of clinical history (including review of motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, comorbid medical conditions, and medications) and neurologic examination was performed. Exclusion criteria included other conditions than PD that could contribute substantially to the subject's motor and/or cognitive impairment, including neurologic and major psychiatric disorders ( delirium,…) affecting the cognitive functions. Patients with major cognitive impairment (i.e. Mental State Examination (MMSE) &lt;16/30) were also excluded.). Neuropsychological assessment explores working memory, episodic memory ,verbal fluency, executive functions and visuo constructive functions.</description>
