  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is known to have immune-modulator effects including suppression of proinflammatory
      cytokine expression and regulation of immune cell activity. Vitamin D supplementation has
      been associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with heart
      failure, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with higher rates of myocardial
      infarcts. The levels of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines also effect the outcome after
      acute coronary events.

      The proposed interventional study is targeted as a feasibility study targeted at assessing
      the role of vitamin D as an anti-inflammatory mediator.

      The study is planned as a randomized open label interventional trial. The study will be
      conducted of 50 adult patients (25 interventional group, 25 control), all from the internal
      ward in &quot;Meir&quot; medical center. Patients which are admitted after an acute coronary event will
      be randomized to the Vitamin D supplementation group or to the control group. the vitamin D
      group will receive 4000IU per day of vitamin D for five days. Cytokine levels will be
      measured at day 1 and at day 5. follow up will be continued for 6 months

      Primary end point:

      Levels of immune mediating cytokines (CRP, TNF-α. Il-2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-10) after a five
      day intervention in patients serum.

      Secondary endpoints:

      Any major cardiovascular event within follow-up period. Any death of any cause during
      follow-up period

      Expected results:

      the investigators expect vitamin D supplementation after a pro-inflammatory state such as an
      acute coronary event, combined with conventional therapy, to result in decreased levels of
      inflammatory serum bio-markers.
