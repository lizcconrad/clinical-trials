  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to provide a substantial evidence of acute bronchodilator
      responsiveness to two sequentially inhaled drugs, a beta2-agonist (i.e., albuterol) and an
      anticholinergic (i.e., tiotropium bromide), in a group of patients who developed obliterative
      bronchiolitis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obliterative bronchiolitis is a life-threatening non-infectious pulmonary complication of
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It is characterized by the
      development of an obstructive abnormality which has been considered to be insensitive to
      bronchodilator treatments. However, this knowledge stems from measurements of forced
      expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) which is relatively insensitive to changes in small airway
      caliber. Moreover, it is known from studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that
      symptoms improve after bronchodilator treatment even when FEV1 is minimally increased and
      correlate with the reduction of lung hyperinflation, which is the major consequence of severe
      expiratory airflow limitation. Therefore, measurements of airway caliber by parameters not
      affected by volume history and absolute lung volumes are preferable for assessing the effect
      of bronchodilator interventions.

      In the current study, the bronchodilators responsiveness will be assessed by using not only
      spirometry but also measurements of absolute lung volumes and the forced expiratory flow of a
      partial maneuver (V'part) started from submaximal lung inflation, thus free of volume history
      effects.

        <description>Following albuterol plus tiotropium inhalation, FEV1 increments ≥12 per cent as compared to baseline, in an individual subject, were considered as evidence of response to bronchodilators, according to the American Thoracic Society-European Respiratory Society standard criteria [Pellegrino et al. Eur Respir J 2005; 26: 948-968]. They were calculated as follows: [FEV1, expressed in liters (L), after bronchodilators - FEV1 (L) before bronchodilators/FEV1 (L) before bronchodilators x 100].</description>

        <description>Following albuterol plus tiotropium inhalation, V'part increments ≥40 per cent as compared to baseline, in an individual subject, were considered as evidence of response to bronchodilators, according to Pellegrino et al. [Chest 1998; 114:1607-1612]. They were calculated as follows: [V'part, expressed in liters.second-1 (L.s-1), after bronchodilators - V'part (L.s-1) before bronchodilators/V'part (L.s-1) before bronchodilators x 100].</description>

          <description>At visit 1, lung function measurements will be performed in triplicate before and 90 min after inhaling four separate doses of 100 μg of albuterol (Ventolin®) and soon after 18 μg of tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®] to ensure maximal or near-maximal bronchodilation. Albuterol will be given by a metered-dose inhaler connected to a valved-holding chamber (Volumatic®) and tiotropium by a dry-powder device (Handihaler®).</description>
