  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic respiratory disease have shortened work life, their disease is associated
      with greater work disability and they are at greater risk of being unemployed. Lower
      employment rates and higher sickness absence is expensive for the community and leads to
      financial as well as social consequences for the individual.

      There is a lack of data on factors that can predict sickness absence and disability in
      patients with pulmonary disease. We therefore want to study a group of people with COPD and
      asthma referred to our clinic. The study will investigate relationships between sickness
      absence and exercise capacity, job-related factors, disease severity, self-efficacy, health
      related quality of life and subjective health complaints.
