  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies Have shown that limb ischemic preconditioning can protect vital organs
      (including the heart) from ischemia-reperfusion injury,which has a broad application
      prospect.But its mechanism is still unclear. Evidence showed that humoral mechanisms may play
      an important role. This study was carried out on the limb ischemic preconditioning in healthy
      volunteers, collected their serum at different time points before and after
      treatment,classified and identified the serum proteins during different periods of limb
      ischemic preconditioning,by using methods including high abundant protein
      removal,Two-dimensional electrophoresis chromatography and mass spectrometry,then analysed
      activation and synthesis of the proteins in order to search for the proteins or peptides
      whose synthesis was activated by ischemic preconditioning. This study will be the first
      systemic explore of the changes in serum proteins of limb ischemic preconditioning in human
      body,and lay theoretical basis for the clinical application of limb ischemic preconditioning
      and for further explore of its humoral mechanism,thus provide clues for searching for protein
      or peptide having protective effects for organs.

      We aim to assess whether limb ischemic preconditioning protects remote tissue or organs
      through a humoral mechanism.

    <description>Transient limb ischemia as a remote ischemic preconditioning stimulus has been shown an effective and non-invasive strategy to protect remote tissue or organs from an extended ischemic event. But the acceptability of human subjects remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the acceptability of this transient limb ischemia protocol in healthy conscious subjects.</description>
