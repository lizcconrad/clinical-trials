      RATIONALE: It is not yet known whether a J-pouch colorectal anastomosis is more effective
      than a straight colorectal anastomosis in treating patients with rectal cancer who have
      undergone surgery to remove the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying J-pouch colorectal anastomosis to see how
      well it works compared with straight colorectal anastomosis in treating patients with rectal
      cancer who have undergone surgery to remove the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess whether the incidence of major anastomotic leak after low anterior resection,
           in patients with rectal cancer, is reduced by using the J-pouch reconstruction vs
           straight colorectal anastomosis.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the global anastomotic leak (major and minor) rate, the incidence of other
           complications in addition to anastomotic leak, and the functional outcome and the
           quality of life in these patients.

        -  To describe, in the J-pouch reconstruction group, the feasibility of the colonic
           J-pouch.

      OUTLINE: Ths is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical center,
      gender (male vs female), and neoadjuvant treatment types. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo a total mesorectal excision with a low anterior rectal resection
           followed by a mechanical straight stapled colorectal anastomosis.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo a total mesorectal excision with a low anterior rectal
           resection followed by a mechanical J-pouch stapled anastomosis reconstruction.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically using EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC
      QLQ-C30 and -CR38), and the MSKCC Bowel Function Questionnaire.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months.
