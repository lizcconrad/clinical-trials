  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of VPM is the development of a recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin expressing
      BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated and efficacious vaccine against
      tuberculosis (TB) for residents in endemic areas and persons at risk in non-endemic areas.
      The new vaccine should be at least as potent as the current strain and should be safer than
      BCG (Kaufmann, 2007a; Grode et al., 2005). The vaccine is formulated as live lyophilised
      bacteria to be re-suspended before intradermal injection. The preceding clinical trial in 80
      volunteers in Germany indicated immunogenicity and safety being sufficient for proceeding
      with the clinical development. Hence, the current study is commenced in South Africa, a
      country highly endemic for tuberculosis.

      24 volunteers were randomly allocated to 4 groups each with 6 adult healthy volunteers.
