    <description>The intervention is negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with the Spiracur SNaP Wound Care system for the treatment of a variety of acute and chronic wounds including pressure ulcers, trauma wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and skin grafts.
The Spiracur SNaP Wound Care system weighs less than 4 ounces, does not utilize an electric pump (device has no electrically powered parts), is fully disposable after use, and is designed for particularly small chronic wounds that require advanced wound care management. It delivers NPWT at a constant pressure level over several days without any required adjustments by the patient or clinician.</description>
