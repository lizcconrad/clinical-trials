      Clinically demonstrated efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone in MM subjects as well as the
      confirmed inhibitory effect of dasatinib on several tyrosine kinase receptors and pathways
      implicated in the pathophysiology of MM. Additionally, as a SRC inhibitor, dasatinib plays an
      important role on bone metabolism through inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption
      in vitro. Dasatinib could, thus, be beneficial on bone density of patients on study, through
      blockage of osteolysis and control of bone lesions.

      Primary Objective: To determine whether the combination of dasatinib with melphalan and
      prednisone provides therapeutic benefits and is safe in patients with relapsed/refractory
      Multiple Myeloma.

      Study design, dose and mode of administration, and duration of treatment: Multicenter,
      open-label, single arm, two-stage, Phase II study of dasatinib in combination with melphalan
      and prednisone (D-MP) in advanced, refractory MM patients. The three drugs will be
      concurrently administered through 6 cycles; each cycle will be 28 days long (1 cycle = 4
      weeks), for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment schedule will be the following:

        -  Melphalan 0,18 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles;

        -  Prednisone 1,5 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles;

        -  Dasatinib 100 mg QD continuously (from day 1 to day 28). After the 6 cycles of D-MP
           treatment, Dasatinib will be continuously administered alone as maintenance, until
           occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal.

      This is a two-stage Phase II trial according to Simon with a bivariate endpoint design, by
      which treatment efficacy and safety are jointly evaluated. This design allows the trial to be
      early stopped after the first stage if the number of observed partial responses (PR) is
      inadequate and the number of observed toxicities is too high. In the first stage of the
      protocol 17 patients are required.

               2. have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

               3. are pregnant or breastfeeding. Sexually active women of childbearing potential
                  (WOCBP) must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the
                  study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study
                  enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of
                  avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for
                  an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior
                  to first receiving dasatinib. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must
                  not receive dasatinib and must not be enrolled in the study.
