      This non-interventional observational study is designed to gain data for Neupro® in restless
      legs syndrome (RLS) under real life conditions in line with the summary of product
      characteristics (SmPC) related to effectiveness, tolerability and switching practice from
      other dopaminergic drugs as well as titration schemes.

    <textblock>
      There is a total of 64 subjects recorded as having discontinued due to Adverse Events.
      Documentation of Visit 2 and Visit 3, where the reason for discontinuation was documented,
      was not available for all subjects. From the documentation on the Adverse Events page in the
      Case Report Form, it is known that 100 subjects discontinued due to Adverse Events.

      The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was utilized for all outcomes.
