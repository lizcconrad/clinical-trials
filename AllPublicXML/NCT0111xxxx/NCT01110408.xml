      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of doripenem compared to
      cefepime in children hospitalized with complicated urinary tract infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor patient
      knows the name of the assigned study drugs), double-dummy (all patients are given both a
      placebo [salt solution] and study drug in alternating periods of time during the study),
      active comparator-controlled (compare the 'test' treatment to standard-of-care therapy),
      multinational, multicenter study to establish the safety and tolerability of the antibiotic
      doripenem compared with the antibiotic cefepime administered by intravenous (iv) infusion
      (slow injection of drug solution into the vein over a period of time) in children ages 3
      months to less than 18 years hospitalized with a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI).
      The study includes 3 periods: a pretreatment (screening) period that will occur within 2 days
      prior to randomization (assignment of study drug); a treatment period of 10 to 14 days where
      the patients will receive study drug treatment, and a posttreatment period consisting of 2
      study visits. The maximum duration of study drug therapy is 14 days. The total duration of
      the study is approximately 7 to 8 weeks for each patient. Safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated by examining the incidence, severity, and type of adverse events, changes in
      clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and findings from physical examinations
      that are recorded as adverse events during treatment and at each posttreatment visit. An
      independent monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established for this study to ensure that the
      safety of patients is not compromised. The IDMC will consist of individuals who are not
      associated with the conduct of the study, and will include but will not be limited to
      individuals with expertise relevant to the care of pediatric patients, and including at least
      one infectious disease physician and at least one statistician. IV study drug therapy
      (Cefepime [50mg/kg up to 2g/dose] and doripenem placebo or doripenem [20mg/kg up to
      500mg/dose] and cefepime placebo will be administered once every 8 hours for up to 14 days.
      After receiving a minimum of 3 days of IV study drug therapy, patients may be discharged from
      the hospital and continue PO antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium,
      ciprofloxacin, or alternative antibiotic therapy.
