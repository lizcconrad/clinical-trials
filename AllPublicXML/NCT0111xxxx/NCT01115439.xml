  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Afghanistan, studies over the past 15 years have shown a high degree of Plasmodium
      falciparum resistance to chloroquine (80%) and more recently an increasing degree of
      resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine monotherapy (12%). In 2003 the high failure rate of
      chloroquine against falciparum malaria led the national malaria treatment programme to switch
      its recommended first line drug treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria to
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the form of
      Artesunate/Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP). Second line drug treatment is oral quinine (7
      days). The aim of this study is to conduct ongoing monitoring of the efficacy of the new
      combination against P. falciparum in a group of sentinel sites in Afghanistan.

      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      Artesunate/Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum
      infections in Nangarhar, Kunar, Thakhar, Faryab malaria control centers in Afghanistan.

      This is an observational study. Patients will receive the recommended treatment for P.
      falciparum malaria in Afghanistan (Nangarhar, Kunar, Thakhar, Faryab malaria control
      centers). The participants will be febrile children above six months of age and non-pregnant
      adults with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Patients will be treated with
      AS+SP according to standard dosing regimens. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be
      monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The study will be
      conducted during the transmission season of falciparum malaria, i.e. October 2009 to January
      2010 and September-December, 2010. Patients will be assessed clinically and via laboratory
      tests, particularly focussing on whether recurrences are recrudescences of the original
      infection or reinfections. All bio-medical findings will be recorded in specific patient case
      record forms and the electronic form of analyzed data as well as a final report will be sent
      to WHO-Afghanistan and National malaria control program offices for further actions. The
      patients will receive reasonable transportation costs for follow-up visits as well as one
      insecticide treated bed-net at the end of enrolment. The results of this study will be used
      to assist the Ministry of Health of Afghanistan in assessing the current national treatment
      guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
