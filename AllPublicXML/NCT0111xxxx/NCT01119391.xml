    <textblock>
      Many women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) ask their doctor if there are any
      behaviors they should avoid, or any behaviors they should emphasize during their IVF cycle.
      This study examines the effects of health habits surrounding exercise, smoking, alcohol,
      sleep, caffeine, herbal medications, acupuncture, and diet on pregnancy rates during IVF
      cycles. The purpose of this study is to determine if lifestyle behaviors have a significant
      impact on pregnancy rates during treatment with IVF.

      This is an observational study conducted at a private academically-affiliated infertility
      clinic and includes 118 women ages 44 and below scheduled to undergo IVF treatment. All
      subjects were asked to complete a health history survey at the time of enrollment and a daily
      survey during each day of their IVF cycle. The primary outcome is clinical pregnancy rate.
