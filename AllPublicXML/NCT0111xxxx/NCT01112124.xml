      The purpose of this study is to assess the typical behavior of children ages 15 months to
      five years around a microwave oven. The UCH Burn and Complex Wound Center has observed scald
      burn injuries in young children operating and/or removing hot liquids from microwave ovens.
      The knowledge we hope to gain is the developmental age that a child is able to open and/or
      operate a microwave oven safely. This work may influence future microwave oven design to
      protect young children from microwave-related scald burn injuries. These injuries have
      resulted in visits to the emergency room, stays in the hospital and debridement and skin
      grafting procedures in the operating room.
