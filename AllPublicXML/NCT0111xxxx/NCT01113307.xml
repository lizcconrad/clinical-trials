      The primary objective of the study is to define procedures for the use of CureXcellTM in the
      community through Clalit Health Services. Secondary objective is to evaluate the blinding
      method in a subgroup of patients, which will be used in a future study named: a
      multinational, multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study for the
      evaluation of the tolerability, safety and efficacy of CureXcell™ therapy plus adequate ulcer
      treatment, in diabetic patients with ulcers in the lower extremities.

      Adults with chronic ulcers; pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers or post
      operative ulcer will be recruited to the study. Patients that have been recruited for the
      study will be treated as required for their medical condition. As required, cultures will be
      taken, IV or PO antibiotics will be given and debridement will be carried out. Patients will
      be referred to catheterization, revascularization, or amputation as required and the decision
      to do so will not be affected in any way by the study. CureXcellTM will be used as adjunct
      treatment to good ulcer care (GUC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients between 18 and 90 years of age with one ulcer that has not shown signs of
             normal healing (according to physician experienced in wound therapy) for more than 3
             weeks

          2. The patient suffers from diabetic ulcer, decubitus ulcer, venous insufficiency ulcer
             and post operative wound.

          3. In patients with suspected malnutrition albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dL in blood tests performed
             within the last three weeks.

          4. Patients with adequate blood perfusion: palpated distal pulses TP or DP or if not
             palpable, arterial pressures during rest ABI &gt; 0.6.

          5. Patients without edema over +2 (patient's edema must be controlled by medical and/or
             bandaging or lympha press).

          6. Use of elastic bandaging in wounds due to venous insufficiency (when there is no
             involvement of an arterial problem).

          7. Wound condition does not immediately jeopardize the extremity.

          8. The patient's life is not at risk (for any reason).

          9. The Patient has a life expectancy of at least one year.

         10. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use reliable methods of birth
             control.

         11. Willing and able to sign an informed consent form and attend the follow up according
             to the treating staff instructions until complete wound closure.

        Inclusion criteria in the 'treatment blinding guessing test':

          1. A patient suffering from diabetes and a chronic ulcer in the lower extremity (ankle
             and below) and is CureXcell™ -naive.

          2. Signing an appendix to the consent form for the 'treatment blinding guessing test'.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             even cast or wheel chair for the treatment period)

          3. Neoplastic ulcer

          4. A patient with active malignant disease during the last five years, except for a
             patient suffering from adequately treated Basal Cell Carcinoma which does not present

          5. Sepsis

          6. Confirmed osteomyelitis

          7. Patients suffering from significant immunosuppression.

          8. INR &gt; 3 in patients receiving anticoagulation drugs, in blood tests performed within
