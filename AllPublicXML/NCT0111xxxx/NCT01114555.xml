  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find how good and how safe the combination of irinotecan,
      temozolomide and bevacizumab is for patients with resistant or recurrent neuroblastoma. These
      drugs have each been given separately to patients, but they have never been given all
      together. Irinotecan and temozolomide are two drugs that have been used together to treat
      neuroblastoma in many people. These drugs are considered chemotherapy. Bevacizumab is another
      drug used to treat cancer. It is made by a company called Genentech. Bevacizumab is an
      antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are found in the blood and can attach themselves to
      bacteria and viruses. Bevacizumab attaches itself to a special protein in the bloodstream.
      This protein helps tumors grow new blood vessels. Blood vessels carry nutrients to feed the
      tumor. Bevacizumab is thought to block this growth of new blood vessels and starve tumors. It
      has been used for the treatment of many cancers in adults. It is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of adults with colon cancer and other cancers but not for people with
      neuroblastoma. There is only a small amount of information known on using this drug in
      children. It has been used with irinotecan before to treat cancer but not in children with
      neuroblastoma.

    <description>Patients will initially receive bevacizumab IV at 15mg/kg/dose (this is defined as Day 1 Three days later (starting day 4), they will receive concurrently, IV irinotecan at 50mg/m2/day x 5 days plus PO temozolomide 150mg/m2/day x 5 days. A second dose of bevacizumab will be administered 14 days after the first one(day 15). The treatment schedule may require minor adjustment as clinically indicated (e.g., due to PDH closure for holidays).</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have the diagnosis of NB in accordance with the International Criteria,
             i.e., either histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or BM
             involvement plus elevated urinary catecholamines.

          -  Must have a history of tumor progression or recurrence or failure to achieve complete
             response with standard therapy.

          -  Patients must have evaluable (microscopic marrow metastasis, MIBG or PET scans) or
             measurable (CT, MRI) disease.
