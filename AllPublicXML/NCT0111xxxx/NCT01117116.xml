        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  20 subjects males or females 18-65 years of age with physician diagnosed asthma
             Diagnosis of asthma &gt; 12 months Currently on 2 puffs SABA bid. Baseline percent FEV1
             of greater than 60% and less than or equal to 100% 12% reversibility in the previous
             12 months 12% reversibility at Screening Visit Positive MTC (≤ 8mg/ml) at the end of 2
             week Run-In Currently symptomatic with ACT score less than 19 at the end of run in on
             ICS ≥ 200 and ≤ 400 ug/day Non-smoker or ex-smoker with &lt; 10 pk year who stopped &gt; 1
             year ago

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Asthma exacerbation, significant airflow obstruction, or respiratory infection between
             Visits 0 and 2. Patients who fail screening because of one of these events may be
             re-screened once (at least 4 weeks after recovery from the event).

        Pre-existing lung disease other than asthma, including active infections Clinically
        significant medical disease that is uncontrolled despite treatment or is likely in the
        opinion of the investigator to require a change in therapy during the study Noncompliance
        or inability to participate in all assessments. Current smoker or former smoker with a
        lifetime smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years. A current smoker is defined as someone who has
        smoked one or more cigarettes per day (or marijuana or a pipe or cigar) for &gt;/= 30 days
        within the 24 months prior to Visit 1.

        Any individual who smokes (cigarettes, marijuana, pipe, or cigar) occasionally, even if for
        &lt; 30 days in the 24 months Prior to Visit 1, must agree to abstain from all smoking from
        the time of consent through completion.

        History of substance abuse that may impair or risk the patient's full participation in the
        study, in the judgment of the investigator.

        Participation in another interventional clinical trial (including a trial of an approved
        drug or an interventional study that does not include medication) within 30 days or 5
        half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.

        Women with a positive urine pregnancy test.
