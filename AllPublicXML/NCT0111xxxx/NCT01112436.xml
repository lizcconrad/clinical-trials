  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of periarticular
      multi-drug regimen injection on the relief of pain in patients undergoing partial hip
      replacement.

      Total 258 patients will be randomized into one of two groups (groupC or groupI) based on
      Excel number generation.

      Patients in group C will receive no medication intraoperatively, and patients in group I will
      receive oral oxycodone and celecoxib preoperatively and a periarticular injection of
      multi-drug regimen during operation.

      Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption and the frequency at which patients
      pushed the button (FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system will be recorded at 1, 4, 7
      postoperative day.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in group I will receive oxycodone SR 10 mg, and celecoxib 200 mg with 10 ml of water
      1 hour before surgery.

      And patients in group I will receive periarticular injection of 50 ml solution which contains
      ropivacaine 15 mg, epinephrine 0.3 mg, cefmetazole 1000mg, ketorolac 30 mg and morphine HCL
      10mg before closure of surgical wound.

      Patients in group C will receive no medication.

    <measure>Visual analogue scale 1day</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Op 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be assessed for pain using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). It is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end; left side end which represents 0 is 'No pain', right side end with 100 is 'Very severe pain'. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.
To check the severity of pain VAS will be measured at post op 1day.</description>

    <time_frame>Post Op 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be taught to push the button of the PCA system, which delivered a bolus of drug, each time pain occurred. In the case of persistent pain greater than a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score of 30 mm, an additional 50 μg of fentanyl will be injected intra-venously by nursing staff until the pain was relieved to a level less than a VAS pain score of 30 mm. And sum of delivery from PCA system and additional opioid fom immediately after operation to post op 1daywill be measured.</description>
