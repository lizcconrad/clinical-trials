  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong association between smoking and schizophrenia with prevalence rates ranging
      from 74% to 90%, versus a national average of 30% in nonschizophrenic individuals. A number
      of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relationship between high smoking rates and
      schizophrenia, mostly relating to self-medication primarily for the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia. Smoking cessation rates among schizophrenic patients are considerably lower
      than for other psychiatric disorders. The negative health effects of smoking increase the
      morbidity and mortality in schizophrenic patients. Currently, the efficacy of bupropion HCl
      in the treatment of smoking by schizophrenic subjects is inconclusive, and there have not
      been any published studies of the efficacy of varenicline in schizophrenic subjects. As
      varenicline appears to be a promising treatment in non-psychiatric patients, it would be
      useful to expand these studies to examine its effects in schizophrenic patients. Identifying
      effective and safe means of smoking cessation for this vulnerable population has the
      potential to reduce morbidity and mortality among individuals with schizophrenia.

      There is a strong association between smoking and schizophrenia with prevalence rates ranging
      from 74% to 90%, versus a national average of 30% in nonschizophrenic individuals. A number
      of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relationship between high smoking rates and
      schizophrenia, mostly relating to self-medication primarily for the negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia. Smoking cessation rates among schizophrenic patients are considerably lower
      than for other psychiatric disorders. The negative health effects of smoking increase the
      morbidity and mortality in schizophrenic patients. The smoking cessation agent bupropion HCl
      has been tested in schizophrenics, but the results on its efficacy are inconclusive. Recent
      works by different laboratories have shown the safety and efficacy of varenicline, a partial
      alpha4beta2 and full alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, as a smoking cessation
      agent. However, to date, no published studies have tested the safety and efficacy of
      varenicline in treatment of nicotine dependence in schizophrenic patients. As varenicline
      appears to be a promising treatment in non-psychiatric patients, it would be beneficial to
      examine its effects in schizophrenic patients. The central hypothesis of this application is
      that treatment with varenicline will safely increase smoking abstinence rates in
      schizophrenic patients when compared to those receiving placebo. This central hypothesis will
      be tested and the objectives of this application accomplished by pursuing two Specific Aims:
      1) Treatment with varenicline or bupropion HCl for a period of three months will increase
      smoking abstinence rates in schizophrenic patents when compared to placebo; and 2) Treatment
      with varenicline or bupropion HCl for a period of three months will not increase psychosis in
      schizophrenic patients when compared to placebo. For our General Investigational Plan, we
      will employ a double-blind randomized placebo controlled study to assess varenicline's safety
      and efficacy. It is our expectation that we will demonstrate that varenicline is safe and
      effective in decreasing smoking rates in schizophrenic patients without exacerbating
      psychotic symptoms. Such outcomes will be significant, because they will offer a new
      treatment for smoking cessation in this vulnerable population.

    <measure>General Psychopathology</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), an 24-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology, and affective symptoms commonly used for schizophrenia with each item rated on a scale of 1-7 with 1=not present and 7=severe. The minimum score is 24 and the maximum score is 168. We have used five subscales as recommended by Dingemans et al., 1995: Positive subscale (minimum score 6; maximum score 42); Negative subscale (minimum score 5; maximum score 35); Depressed subscale (minimum score 5; maximum score 35); Mania subscale (minimum score 6; maximum score 42); and Disorientation subscale (minimum score 2; maximum score 14) . For both the total score and the subscale scores, the higher the score, the greater the symptom severity. We used the BPRS version 4.0. Dingemans PMAJ, Linszen DH, Lenoir ME, Smeets RMW, 1995.

    <measure>Hit Reaction Time - CPT</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The hit reaction time is the average speed of correct responses for the entire test given in milliseconds. The higher the score, the slower the speed. The standard error is a measure of response speed consistency. The higher the overall standard error, the greater inconsistency in the response speed. The values below were measured at week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variability of Standard Error - CPT</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Variability of Standard Error (VSE) is a measure of response speed consistency. VSE measures &quot;within respondent&quot; variability. That is, the amount of variability the individual shows in 18 separate segments of the Continuous Performance Test in relation to his or her own overall standard error. Although VSE is a different measure than Overall Standard Error, typically the two measures produce comparable results. The higher the VSE, the greater the inconsistency in the response speed. The values shown below are the VSE for Week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Detectibility (d') of Continuous Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The value d' is a measure of the difference between the signal (non-X) and noise (X) distributions. As such, d' provides a means for assessing an individual's discriminative power since, in general, the greater the difference between the signal and noise distributions, the better the ability to distinguish and detect X and non-X stimuli. The lower the score, the better the detectability. Values shown below are for week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Style Indicator (Beta) for CPT</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Beta represents an individual's response tendency: Some individuals are cautious and choose not to respond very often. Conceptually, such individuals want to make sure they are correct when they give a response. Higher values of Beta reflect this response style. The emphasis is on avoiding commission errors. Other individuals respond more freely to make sure they respond to most or all targets, and they tend to be less concerned about mistakenly responding to a non-target. Lower values of Beta are produced by this response style. Values shown below were obtained at week 12.</description>

    <measure>Abstinence Related Symptoms - WISDM</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) consists of 68 items regarding smoking. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (not true of me at all) to 7 (extremely true of me) leading to a minimum score of 68 and a maximum score of 476. The higher the score, the greater the dependence. Four of the items are grouped into a Craving subscale (minimum 4, maximum 28), the greater the score, the greater the craving. Five of the items are grouped into a Cognition subscale (minimum 5, maximum 35), the higher the score, the greater reliance on cigarette smoking for cognitive enhancement. WISDM scoring based on the original article by Piper et al., 2004. A multiple motives approach to tobacco dependence: the Wisconsin inventory of smoking dependence motives (WISDM-68). Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 72:139-154.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urge to Smoke - MNWS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) includes two items where individuals are asked to 1) declare the percentage of time they had an urge to smoke (MNWS % Urge to Smoke); and 2) declare the percentage of time they had a strong urge to smoke (MNWS % Strong Urge). For each case, percentages range from 0% to 100% - the higher the percentage, the greater urge to smoke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Movements - AIMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), to assess abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs. There are 10 questions, based on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). Items 11-14 are yes/no questions that have no impact on the score. The Total Score is the sum of questions 1-7 (minimum = 0; maximum = 28). The severity index consists of one question (item 8; rated 0=none to 4=severe) based on the rater's observation of abnormal movements The AIMS Global Score is the sum of three questions (each item rated 0=none to 4=severe) regarding abnormal movements overall (minimum score 0, maximum score 12). For the total score and subscores, the higher the score, the greater the severity of abnormal movements. Scoring is based on the chapter: Guy W (2000), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), in: Handbook of Psychiatric Measures (Rush AJ Jr, et al., eds). APA Publishing: Washington DC: pp. 166-167.</description>

        <title>Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia - SANS</title>
        <description>Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) a well-established test, used to assess the presence of psychosis or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 25 questions rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 5 (severe). With a total score range of 0 to 125 points. There are 6 subscales: Affective Flattening or Blunting - (minimum, 0; maximum 35); Inappropriate Affect (minimum, 0; maximum 5); Alogia (minimum 0; maximum 25); Avolition-Apathy (minimum 0; maximum 20); Anhedonia-Asociality (minimum 0; maximum 25); Attention (minimum 0; maximum 15). Each subscale (except for Inappropriate Affect) contains one additional question as a Global Rating - or overall measure for that particular subscale. The sum of these questions constitutes the Total Global Score (minimum 0, maximum 25). The global questions are included within the Total Composite score. In each case, the larger the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

          <title>Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia - SANS</title>
          <description>Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) a well-established test, used to assess the presence of psychosis or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 25 questions rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 5 (severe). With a total score range of 0 to 125 points. There are 6 subscales: Affective Flattening or Blunting - (minimum, 0; maximum 35); Inappropriate Affect (minimum, 0; maximum 5); Alogia (minimum 0; maximum 25); Avolition-Apathy (minimum 0; maximum 20); Anhedonia-Asociality (minimum 0; maximum 25); Attention (minimum 0; maximum 15). Each subscale (except for Inappropriate Affect) contains one additional question as a Global Rating - or overall measure for that particular subscale. The sum of these questions constitutes the Total Global Score (minimum 0, maximum 25). The global questions are included within the Total Composite score. In each case, the larger the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

        <description>Impulsivity and inattention will be measured using the continuous performance test. Individuals were tasked with 359 items divided six blocks (59 in block 1, 60 in blocks 2-6). Omissions result from the failure to respond to target letters. CPT% Omissions measures the percentage of responses that qualify as omissions made during the test. Higher scores indicate increased inattention. Commissions result from responses given to non-targets. CPT% Commissions measures the percentage of responses that qualify as commissions made during the test. Higher scores indicate increased inattention. Perseverations result from reaction time less than 100 ms. CPT% Perseveration % measures the percentage of responses that qualify as perseverations made during the test. The higher the score, the greater impulsivity.</description>

          <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), is a survey intended to quantify the severity of suicidal ideation and behavior. The questionaire for suicidal ideation consists of 5 questions with yes (1) /no (0) answers. If answers to questions 1 and 2 are no, questions 3-5 are skipped. Minimum of 0; Maximum of 5. The questionaire for suicidal behavior consists of seven questions rated 0 for no and 1 for yes. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 7. In each case, the higher the score, the greater the severity.</description>

        <description>Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), a well-established test, used to assess the presence of psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. There are 34 items rated on a scale of 0-5 with 0=none and 5=severe for a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 170. There are 4 subscales: Hallucinations (minimum score 0; maximum score 35); Delusions (minimum score 0; maximum score 65); Bizarre Behavior (minimum score 0; maximum score 25); Positive Formal Thought Disorder (minimum score 0; maximum score 45). Each subscale contains one additional question as a Global Rating - or overall measure for that particular subscale. The sum of these questions constitutes the Total Global Score (minimum 0, maximum 20). The values for the Global items are included in the Total Composite score. In each case, the higher the score, the greater the severity of symptoms.</description>

The minimum score is 24 and the maximum score is 168. We have used five subscales as recommended by Dingemans et al., 1995: Positive subscale (minimum score 6; maximum score 42); Negative subscale (minimum score 5; maximum score 35); Depressed subscale (minimum score 5; maximum score 35); Mania subscale (minimum score 6; maximum score 42); and Disorientation subscale (minimum score 2; maximum score 14) .

        <description>Variability of Standard Error (VSE) is a measure of response speed consistency. VSE measures &quot;within respondent&quot; variability. That is, the amount of variability the individual shows in 18 separate segments of the Continuous Performance Test in relation to his or her own overall standard error. Although VSE is a different measure than Overall Standard Error, typically the two measures produce comparable results. The higher the VSE, the greater the inconsistency in the response speed.

        <description>The value d' is a measure of the difference between the signal (non-X) and noise (X) distributions. As such, d' provides a means for assessing an individual's discriminative power since, in general, the greater the difference between the signal and noise distributions, the better the ability to distinguish and detect X and non-X stimuli. The lower the score, the better the detectability. Values shown below are for week 12.</description>

          <title>Detectibility (d') of Continuous Performance Test</title>
          <description>The value d' is a measure of the difference between the signal (non-X) and noise (X) distributions. As such, d' provides a means for assessing an individual's discriminative power since, in general, the greater the difference between the signal and noise distributions, the better the ability to distinguish and detect X and non-X stimuli. The lower the score, the better the detectability. Values shown below are for week 12.</description>

        <description>Beta represents an individual's response tendency: Some individuals are cautious and choose not to respond very often. Conceptually, such individuals want to make sure they are correct when they give a response. Higher values of Beta reflect this response style. The emphasis is on avoiding commission errors. Other individuals respond more freely to make sure they respond to most or all targets, and they tend to be less concerned about mistakenly responding to a non-target. Lower values of Beta are produced by this response style. Values shown below were obtained at week 12.</description>

        <title>Abstinence Related Symptoms - WISDM</title>
        <description>The Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) consists of 68 items regarding smoking. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (not true of me at all) to 7 (extremely true of me) leading to a minimum score of 68 and a maximum score of 476. The higher the score, the greater the dependence. Four of the items are grouped into a Craving subscale (minimum 4, maximum 28), the greater the score, the greater the craving. Five of the items are grouped into a Cognition subscale (minimum 5, maximum 35), the higher the score, the greater reliance on cigarette smoking for cognitive enhancement. WISDM scoring based on the original article by Piper et al., 2004. A multiple motives approach to tobacco dependence: the Wisconsin inventory of smoking dependence motives (WISDM-68).

        <title>Abnormal Movements - AIMS</title>
        <description>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), to assess abnormal involuntary movements associated with antipsychotic drugs. There are 10 questions, based on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). Items 11-14 are yes/no questions that have no impact on the score. The Total Score is the sum of questions 1-7 (minimum = 0; maximum = 28). The severity index consists of one question (item 8; rated 0=none to 4=severe) based on the rater's observation of abnormal movements The AIMS Global Score is the sum of three questions (each item rated 0=none to 4=severe) regarding abnormal movements overall (minimum score 0, maximum score 12). For the total score and subscores, the higher the score, the greater the severity of abnormal movements. Scoring is based on the chapter: Guy W (2000), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), in: Handbook of Psychiatric Measures (Rush AJ Jr, et al., eds). APA Publishing: Washington DC: pp. 166-167.</description>
