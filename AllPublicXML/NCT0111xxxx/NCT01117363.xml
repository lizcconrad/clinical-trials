  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute hunger-reducing effects (8h) has been documented for rye porridge breakfast compared
      with iso-caloric referenced refined wheat reference breakfast. The primary aim of the current
      study is to investigate whether this effects remains at regular consumption. A secondary aim
      is to compare the orocecal transit time (OCTT) between the two breakfasts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is randomised and cross-over. During two 3-wk periods, separated by a 3-4-wks wash
      out, subjects will consume test breakfasts. During one of the periods test breakfast includes
      rye flake porridge and during the other period test breakfast include bread made from sifted
      wheat. The breakfast meals will be similar in calorie-, protein-, carbohydrate- and fat
      content. For all other days but 1, 8 and 22 of respective test period, the breakfast foods
      will be handed out to the participants along with instructions to exchange their ordinary
      breakfast with the test foods. During day 1, 8 and 22 the breakfasts will be served at the
      study centre.

      Following measurements will be made:

        1. Subjective ratings of hunger, satiety and desire to eat during 24 h after breakfast on
           day 1, 8 and 22 during each 3-wk intervention period.

        2. on day 8 during each intervention period, orocecal transit time and breath hydrogen will
           be measured after intake of the breakfast.

        3. 3 day weighed food diaries will be taken at three occasions: at baseline and during the
           second week of each dietary intervention period.

    <description>Salazopyrin (two 500 mg tabelts) is taken after breakfast. The substance passes the stomach and small intestine unabsorbed and is broken down by microbial fermentation in the colon to sulphapyridine and 5-ASA. Sulphapyridine appearance in the blood is then measured as an indicator of colon arrival time.</description>
