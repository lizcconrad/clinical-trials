    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that combination of endoscopic therapy with vasoconstrictor is better
      than either vasoconstrictor or endoscopic therapy alone in achieving the successful
      hemostatsis of acute variceal bleeding. The rationale of using vasoconstrictor is to enhance
      the efficacy of hemostasis by endoscopic therapy. Nowadays, endoscopic variceal ligation
      (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as the endoscopic treatment of
      choice in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. EVL alone can achieve
      hemotasis up to 97% even in cases of active variceal hemorrhage. However, early rebleeding
      due to ligation-induced ulcer may be encountered. It appears that prevention of esophageal
      ulcers and bleeding by a proton pump inhibitor may be more logical than using a
      vasoconstrictor after cessation of bleeding by EVL.

      Previous studies showed that combination of endoscopic therapy with vasoconstrictor is better
      than either vasoconstrictor or endoscopic therapy alone in achieving the successful
      hemostatsis of acute variceal bleeding. The rationale of using vasoconstrictor is to enhance
      the efficacy of hemostasis by endoscopic therapy. Nowadays, endoscopic variceal ligation
      (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as the endoscopic treatment of

      due to ligation-induced ulcer may be encountered. It appears that prevention of esophageal
      ulcers and bleeding by a proton pump inhibitor may be more logical than using a
      vasoconstrictor after cessation of bleeding by EVL.

      Thus, we designed a controlled trial to compare the initial hemostasis, early rebleeding rate
      in cirrhotic patients presenting with acute variceal bleeding receiving either emergency EVL
      plus somatostatin infusion or losec infusion for 5 days.

      AIMS:

      To investigate whether the combination of EVL and somatostatin is superior to the combination
      of EVL and losec in terms of efficacy in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal bleeding
      and very early rebleeding.
