  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate the non-opioid (non-narcotic) pain-relieving
      medications clonidine and gabapentin to see if they decrease the amount of opioid pain
      medications needed after surgery, thereby reducing opioid-related side effects, and time
      required to return to normal activities of daily living after surgery.
