  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable variation in scarring, within and between people, and between different
      ethnic groups. Individuals with more pigmented skin are more prone to severe scarring than
      those traditionally termed white. Prevascar is being developed by Renovo for use as a
      potential treatment for reducing scarring.

      Renovo's histological analysis of wounds and scars in human non drug studies demonstrates an
      increase in wound and scar width in subjects of African Caribbean ancestry over a 12 month
      period.

      It is hypothesised that IL-10 may be a potentially beneficial therapy for the reduction of
      scarring in Non Caucasians of African-Caribbean ancestry.

      This Renovo clinical trial will be carried out primarily to establish the effects of four
      doses of Prevascar on 1cm incisional and excisional scars in subjects of African Continental
      Group ancestry, as compared to placebo, and to further investigate the safety and tolerance
      of intradermally injected Prevascar in wounds.
