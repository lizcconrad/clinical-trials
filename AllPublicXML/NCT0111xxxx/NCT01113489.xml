  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it is well known that the presence of uncontrolled inflammation in upper airways may
      compromise the control of asthma and may favor the progression of asthma toward more severe
      grades of disease, few studies addressed whether therapies aimed to control both upper and
      lower airway inflammation may be more effective in controlling asthma. Markers of oxidative
      stress and of inflammation such as Nitrotyrosine and IL-5 are increased in the airways of
      children with atopic asthma and correlated with the levels of oral and nasal FeNO, and with
      the grade of atopy. We hypothesize that the treatment with Beclometasone nebulized with a
      facial mask (for treating both upper and lower airways) will be able to reduce the production
      of oxidants as well as of IL5 in both districts thus promoting clinical and functional
      improvements in mild intermittent asthmatic children. The results provided by this study will
      contribute to further clarify the relationship between nasal and bronchial inflammation.
