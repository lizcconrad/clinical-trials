  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of oral
      probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus versus oral placebo for reducing colonization by MRSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare-associated infections are an important threat to patient safety. Currently,
      between 5 and 10 percent of patients admitted to acute care hospitals acquire one or more
      infections; healthcare-associated infections affect approximately 2 million patients each
      year in the United States, result in 90,000 deaths, and are associated with an added cost of
      $4.5 to $5.7 billion per year. Seventy percent of healthcare-associated infections are caused
      by antimicrobial resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA), resulting in increased antimicrobial usage, morbidity and mortality, making
      prevention of multiresistant bacteria essential.

      Eradication of colonization has been shown to greatly reduce infection; however, there are no
      reliable means of providing sustained eradication of colonization. No effective means of
      eradicating MRSA colonization exist.

      Probiotics containing strains of lactobacilli represent a novel approach to the prevention
      and control of antimicrobial resistance and have been studied extensively for a variety of
      infections. Even though various studies have shown probiotics to be effective for prevention
      of vaginal infections, urinary tract infections, etc no studies have examined the potential
      of probiotics to eradicate colonization by resistant pathogens, such as MRSA.
