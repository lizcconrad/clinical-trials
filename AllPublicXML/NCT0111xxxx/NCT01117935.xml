      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy,
      that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and
      cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies intensity-modulated external beam radiation therapy in
      treating patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that patients can safely receive IMRT teletherapy using the proposed IMRT
      fractionation schedule without experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment efficacy through the surrogate measures of PSA nadir and biochemical
      failure-free survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5
      days a week, for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease may also receive concurrent and adjuvant or
      long-term androgen deprivation therapy for up to 36 months. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for
      2 years, and then annually until year 5.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate are eligible for protocol
             enrollment when the following criteria are met; patients must have low, intermediate
             or high-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as defined by the National Comprehensive
             Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria

          -  A diagnostic CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be obtained to rule out regional
             disease (maximum of 60 days prior to registration) for high-risk patients only

          -  A bone scan showing no evidence of metastatic disease is also required for patients
             whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is greater than 20 ng/ml, Gleason's sum is
             greater than 7, or T-stage is greater than T2b

          -  Alkaline phosphatase within 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) is required for all
             patients beginning hormone therapy

          -  AST within 1.5 x ULN is required for all patients beginning hormone therapy

          -  Bilirubin within 1.5 x ULN is required for all patients beginning hormone therapy

          -  Karnofsky Performance score &gt;= 80

          -  Prior to registration, patients having received no more than three months treatment
             with anti-androgen, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, or a
             combination of the two remain eligible for protocol treatment; the qualifying PSA for
             these patients will be the value recorded prior to the initiation of the hormone
             therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of inflammatory bowel disease, or who require steroid or
             cytotoxic therapy for collagen vascular disease

          -  Patients with a history of cancer other than skin cancer within five years of the
             initiation of protocol treatment

          -  Patients with a history of pelvic irradiation for any reason
