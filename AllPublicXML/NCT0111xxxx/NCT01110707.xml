  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomized, Phase II, comparative study with a parallel control for
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of recombinant human follicle
      stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH). The combined
      treatment was administered at the middle of the follicular phase in subjects undergoing
      in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and transfer of
      embryos (ET).

    <measure>Mean Number of Metaphase II (M-II) Oocytes Retrieved</measure>
    <time_frame>36 hours post r-hCG administration</time_frame>
    <description>Mean number of M-II oocytes were calculated for subjects undergoing ovum pick up for Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). ICSI is an in-vitro fertilization procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg under a microscope. Metaphase II stage of the oocyte was classified as the time at which the first polar body was observed microscopically. Metaphase II oocytes are a sub-group of the total number of oocytes.</description>

    <measure>Number of Fertilized Oocytes (2 Pronuclei [2PN])</measure>
    <time_frame>36 hours post r-hCG administration</time_frame>
    <description>Oocytes were fertilized using Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) technique which is an in-vitro fertilization procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg under a microscope. The appearance of 2PN is the first sign of successful fertilization as observed during in vitro fertilization, and is usually observed after ICSI. The zygote is then termed 2PN.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Embryos</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2-3 post r-hCG administration</time_frame>
    <description>Embryos were classified into 5 different grades (1 to 5) based on their capacity of implantation. Grade 1 embryos were those with best capacity of implantation and Grade 5 embryos were those with worst capacity of implantation. Mean number of embryos for each of the 5 grades were reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Embryo Implantation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>35-42 days post r-hCG administration</time_frame>
    <description>Embryo implantation rate was measured as the number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>Mean number of M-II oocytes were calculated for subjects undergoing ovum pick up for Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). ICSI is an in-vitro fertilization procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg under a microscope. Metaphase II stage of the oocyte was classified as the time at which the first polar body was observed microscopically. Metaphase II oocytes are a sub-group of the total number of oocytes.</description>
