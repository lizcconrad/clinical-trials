      The primary objectives of this study are to determine safety and pharmacokinetics of ABT-348
      as monotherapy and when given in combination with azacitidine. The secondary objectives are
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of ABT-348 when
      administered as monotherapy and when given in combination with azacitidine in subjects with
      advanced hematologic malignancies.
