  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if patients being treated with second generation
      antipsychotics and with clinically meaningful elevations/levels in any metabolic syndrome
      elements will have better access to medical treatment more quickly if they are randomized to
      one of the following conditions: 1) a primary care provider located in the community mental
      health center where mental health treatment is provided (IMBED), 2) a medical care manager to
      help coordinate treatment with an outside primary care provider (Liaison) or 3) the standard
      practice of advising the patient to see a primary care doctor (Treatment as Usual).

      Individuals will be identified for participation based upon baseline laboratory values
      obtained at the local Community Mental Health Clinic (CMHC) as part of the standard
      monitoring procedures for individuals on Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs). Following
      randomization, a research assistant will be assigned to obtain information on primary care
      provider visits, medications and lab tests conducted outside of the CMHC using a signed
      release for from the patient. Variables collected include: date and time of all physician or
      practitioner visits, type of practitioner, all medication prescriptions, and all laboratory
      values and vital signs related to metabolic syndrome parameters. Data will be put into an
      access data base for analysis. Data from private pharmacies will be obtained using a separate
      signed consent form.

    <description>We will compare the efficacy of IMBED, Liaison and Treatment as Usual for improving utilization of care. The primary outcome variables are time to contact with primary care practitioner, number of primary care visits, receiving appropriate medications, receiving appropriate labs, and receiving dietary and life style counseling.</description>

    <description>A medical assistant will provide feedback on and educational materials describing the meaning of lab values to individuals identified as needing follow-up for metabolic syndrome, and will provide educational materials regarding healthy eating and exercise. The psychiatrist will recommend that the individual contact a primary care physician to follow-up on out of range values, and alter behaviors (over eating, being sedentary) to help improve health.</description>

    <description>After identifying individuals through routine screening that need medical follow-up for metabolic syndrome, these individuals will be scheduled to see the on site primary care provider. Rapid scheduling (within 2 weeks) will be attempted. Patients will be seen by the primary care provider monthly or as needed as determined per patient. The primary care provider will prescribe medications for metabolic syndrome, discuss the patient with psychiatry staff and recommend follow-up appointments for physical problems based upon recommended guidelines and clinical judgment of necessity and urgency. Referral to a specialist will be made according to standard primary care practice guidelines. During the Metabolic Syndrome Clinic, if individuals bring up other medical conditions, they will be referred for treatment of these conditions to an outside primary care provider.</description>

    <description>Patients will be seen by the MCM bi-weekly or as needed as determined per patient. The MCM will discuss findings of the labs with the patient, work to get the individual an appointment with a primary care doctor, get releases of information to discuss treatment coordination between the primary care and psychiatric teams, obtain necessary records from primary care, and communicate findings to the treating psychiatrist. The MCM will also assist the patient in getting to primary care appointments by providing bus passes or other transportation, and with obtaining medications prescribed by the primary care provider. This may necessitate enrolling the patient in specific care plans as needed.</description>
