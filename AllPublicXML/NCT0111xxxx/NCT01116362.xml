  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of injuries to major nerve trunks in the hand and upper extremity remains a major
      and challenging reconstructive problem. Our goal was to compare primary versus secondary
      repair of median and\or ulnar nerve by electrodiagnostic assessment and clinical examination.

    <description>identification of motor level were done based on British Medical Research Council guided.The abductor pollicis brevis (APB) was used for the median nerve and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) for the ulnar nerve. as follows: 0, M0, M1 and M2; 1, M3; 2, M4.</description>

    <description>identification of motor and sensory level were done based on British Medical Research Council guided.The abductor pollicis brevis (APB) was used for the median nerve and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) for the ulnar nerve. The results scored as follows: 0, S0, S1 and S2; 1, S3; 2, S4 and S5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>nerve conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 18 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>For electrodiagnostic assessment, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was tested as motor and sensory. The results categorized according to the Yale sensory scale and the severity of sensation and function of the nerves was scored as follows: 0, no sensation; 1, decreased or abnormal sensation; 2, normal sensation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>at 18 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>For an EMG, a needle electrode was inserted through the skin into the muscle which injured nerve supplied. The presence, size and shape of the waveform registered and the ability of the muscle to respond when the nerves were stimulated. Also these results scored as follows: 0, no activity; 1, few or single movement; 2, partial activity; 3, full activity.</description>
