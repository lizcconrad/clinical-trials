  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors at MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) are doing a research study to learn if a
      gluten free-dairy free (GFCF) diet is helpful in improving gastrointestinal symptoms
      associated with autism.

      Hypothesis: The gluten free/casein free diet (GFCF) will result in a higher proportion of
      subjects having reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms associated with autism spectrum
      disorders (ASD).

      Primary Study Objective:

        -  To assess the effect of a GFCF diet on GI symptoms associated with ASD.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess if improvements in GI symptoms result in improvements in autistic behavior
           when using a GFCF diet in the dietary management of GI symptoms associated with ASD

        -  To determine the nutritional impact of a GFCF restrictive diet

        -  To assess the role of food allergies in the manifestation of GI symptoms

      This is a 14-week study that requires between 5 &amp; 9 office visits. All study related
      activities -including physical exams, blood samples and allergy testing - and an amino acid
      based supplement drink, are at no cost. Research study visits will take place at MGHfC in
      Boston, or at Newton Wellesley Hospital in Newton, or at Lurie Center/LADDERS in Lexington.
