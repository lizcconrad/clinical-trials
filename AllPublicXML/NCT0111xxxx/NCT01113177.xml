  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis is known to alter the mandibular development in
      children diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In a number of cases a genuine
      breakdown of cartilage and bone is seen in the affected joint which leads to asymmetric
      mandibular growth in the affected side. In cases of unilateral TMJ involvements severe
      mandibular asymmetric mandibular growth deviations are seen. We hypothesize that these growth
      deviations can be minimized and controlled by the use functional orthodontic appliance
      therapy.

      This is a retrospective study design with the aim to evaluate the clinical procedures we have
      used the last 15 years to treat JIA patients with unilateral TMJ arthritis. More
      specifically, the purpose is to evaluate the mandibular growth in all JIA patients with
      unilateral TMJ arthritis and an asymmetric mandibular growth pattern treated with
      non-surgical distraction splint therapy between 1994 and 2010 at the dep. of Orthodontics,
      Aarhus University, Denmark. The evaluation is based on radiological examinations at the
      beginning of their non-surgical distraction treatment as well as after the patients have
      finished their distraction-splint therapy.

    <measure>Mandibular growth in children with unilateral TMJ arthritis treated with an acrylic distraction splint</measure>
    <time_frame>average treatment with splint is 6.4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The craniofacial dimensions are measured radiologically prior to the start of the treatment with the distraction splint. Second measurements of the craniofacial dimensions are evaluated after the patients have ended the treatment with the distraction splint. In that way we are able to evaluate the craniofacial growth in the affected side compared to the craniofacial growth in the &quot;healthy&quot; side in JIA patients with unilateral TMJ arthritis. The succces of the distraction splint treatment is decided based the splints ability to normalize the craniofacial growth in the affacted side.</description>

    <description>After the diagnosis of unilateral TMJ arthritis with clinical asymmetric mandibular growth deviations the JIA patients are offered treatment with a distraction splint. The appliance consists of an acrylic splint (distraction splint) covering the occlusal surfaces of the teeth in the upper or lower dental arch. The height of the splint is thereafter gradually increased every 6th to 10th weeks in order to optimize the mandible growth in the affected side and thereby reduce the overall asymmetric mandibular growth pattern(non-surgical distraction of the TMJ and mandibular condyle).</description>
