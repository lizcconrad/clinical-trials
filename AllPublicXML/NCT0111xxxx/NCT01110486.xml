      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and maximum
      tolerated dose of ABT-348 as monotherapy and when given in combination with carboplatin or
      docetaxel. The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety at the recommended Phase
      2 dose and evaluate preliminary efficacy data regarding objective response rate time to
      progression, duration of overall response, and ECOG performance status of ABT-348 as
      monotherapy and when given in combination with carboplatin or docetaxel.
