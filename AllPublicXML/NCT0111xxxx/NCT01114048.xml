      In this study, the investigators will analyze the long-term outcomes of remission and
      survival, and identify those with primary resistant disease as more likely to benefit from
      CTD (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone) and early intensification of Vel-CD
      (bortezomib and CD) as induction chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell
      transplantation for the patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy and toxicities of CTD and Vel-CD induction followed by
      high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for the
      patients with multiple myeloma.The investigators already investigated the thalidomide-based
      chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM. The combined regimen consisted of
      cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) for induction treatment. CTD
      chemotherapy resulted in a favorable response with 79.4% overall response rate including
      42.6% complete response (CR) or very good partial complete response (VGPR), and tolerable
      toxicity in MM patients. Moreover, CTD chemotherapy did not affect the yield of the stem cell
      collection.The investigators also published that the clinical efficacy and safety of a
      four-drug combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone was
      assessed for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma Vel-CTD chemotherapy.
