    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this non-interventional study is to evaluate daily symptom
      variability in COPD patients. The secondary objectives are; to evaluate effects of COPD
      symptoms on the morning activities of patients, to determine therapeutic expectations of
      patients and physicians in COPD, to determine which and how frequent non-drug approaches are
      recommended in order to prevent COPD exacerbations, to define COPD patient profiles about the
      below-mentioned issues: Demographic characteristics, Disease characteristics, Concomitant
      diseases and implemented drug treatments. All patients, who apply to the study physicians and
      fulfill all patient selection criteria during patient enrolment period, will be included.
      Patients, who provide all of the following measures will be included in the study: To apply
      to a physician for outpatient treatment for any reason, Age over 45 years, being diagnosed
      with COPD, being a smoker or used to be a smoker once (&gt; 10 package years), to give consent
      for the use of their medical data. The patients that exhibit the following exclusion criteria
      will be excluded from the study: COPD exacerbations still on-going or experienced in the last
      3 months (Exacerbation is defined as worsening of COPD symptoms leading to antibiotic and/or
      short-term oral steroid treatment and/or hospitalization or admission to the emergency
      unit.); Presence of lung cancer or an important respiratory disease such as bronchiectasis,
      pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis; Participation
      in an interventional clinical trial at present and Enrollment in this study once. In this
      study, patients will be recorded at their visit to the physician and there will be no
      follow-up thereafter.
