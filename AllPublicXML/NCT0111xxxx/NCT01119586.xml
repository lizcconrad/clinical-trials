      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood or tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in DNA samples from patients with newly
      diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To perform pooled DNA sequencing in 56 genes from the genomic DNA of unaffected children
           and matched non-tumor and blast DNA from patients with high-risk (HR) acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enrolled on COG HR ALL protocols.

        -  To identify loci enriched for genetic variation between DNA of unaffected children and
           DNA of these patients.

        -  To individually validate novel, putatively functional single nucleotide polymorphisms
           (SNPs) identified via pooled sequencing with another genotyping platform.

        -  To correlate HR ALL with clinical phenotypes, co-morbidities, toxicities, outcomes to
           the genes or pathways found to harbor a significant increase in genetic variation.

      OUTLINE: DNA specimens from unaffected children (pool 1) and from patients with non-tumor
      (pool 2) and leukemia blasts (pool 3) are analyzed for genetic pathophysiology of pre-B acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia by microarray and PCR assays. Sequencing is performed on each of the 3
      PCR pools of DNA.
