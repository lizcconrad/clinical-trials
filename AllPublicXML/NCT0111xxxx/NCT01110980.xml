    <textblock>
      -  Background:

      Oral nutrition appears to be a challenge for patients with head and neck cancer after
      radiotherapy. Many patients desire to (their) `normal food intake` and return to oral
      nutrition with normal consistency without modifications and diet formulas. Due to the
      dysphagia experienced post treatment this seems tremendously difficult. Referral to a
      speech-language therapist for swallowing therapy is no standard procedure.

        -  Study design:

      A prospective randomized study in patients with a tumor in Oral cavity, Nasopharynx,
      Oropharynx, Hypopharynx or Larynx with stage II-IV (UICC TNM-tumor classification), â‰¥ 18
      years, eligible for primary treatment with (chemo)radiation or adjuvant radiotherapy with
      curative intent.

        -  Intervention:

      Individually tailored swallowing therapy by an experienced speech-language therapist in
      cooperation with individual dietary counselling (by an experienced dietician, `usual care`)
      pre-, per- and post treatment (until 6 months after treatment). This might improve `normalcy
      of food intake`, quality (no food modifications) and quantity of food intake and besides
      decrease the use of tube feeding and/or nutritional supplements. Also patients quality of
      life and nutritional status may be influenced positively.

        -  Study hypothesis:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combined individual swallowing therapy and
      individual dietary counselling in patients with head and neck cancer receiving
      (chemo)radiotherapy can improve 'normal food intake'. Food intake without modifications and
      tube feeding and/or nutritional supplements.
