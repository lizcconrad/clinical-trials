    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) of patients
      with triple negative breast cancer randomised to treatment with standard adjuvant
      chemotherapy alone or to standard adjuvant chemotherapy followed by 1 year of Capecitabine
      (Xeloda) metronomic therapy.

      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease without tumor-specific
      treatment options. Patients with triple-negative disease had an increased likelihood of
      distant recurrence and death within 5 years of diagnosis. Median time to distant recurrence
      was significantly shorter. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition
      of Capecitabine to standard adjuvant therapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either standard chemotherapy (according to NCCN
      guideline), or standard chemotherapy followed by 1 year of metronomic Capecitabine (650mg/m2,
      twice every day). The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months, and the target sample
      size is 432 individuals.Disease-free Survival (DFS) will be primary end point.
