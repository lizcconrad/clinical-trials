  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test whether beta-endorphin, a substance our bodies make in response
      to painful and stressful stimuli, plays a causative role in radiation-induced fatigue that
      cancer patients receiving radiation therapy commonly experience. If this is so, the
      investigators' hope is to direct efforts at treating radiation-induced fatigue using agents
      that block the action of beta-endorphin with the aim of improving quality of life for
      patients undergoing radiation therapy

    <textblock>
      Participants will be breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy at Massachusetts
      General Hospital. There will be two groups of patients: those receiving adjuvant radiation
      therapy alone following surgical tumor resection, and those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy following surgical tumor resection. Patients receiving any radiation
      regimen detailed below in section 2b are eligible for the study. In this study the
      investigators will be drawing blood for beta-endorphin measurement prior to, at various times
      during, and following patients' treatment regimens. In addition, at each blood draw, patients
      will complete questionnaires that assess fatigue, mood, and pain. These questionnaires have
      all been validated for use in cancer patients (see &quot;Procedures Involving Human Participants
      section below), and for our study, the investigators have formatted them onto computer
      tablets for ease of patient completion and data analysis. This study will progress as
      follows:

      Patients: Patients expected to receive adjuvant radiation therapy at Massachusetts General
      Hospital will be approached for enrollment onto this study. Two groups of patients, a
      chemotherapy group and a non-chemotherapy group, will be enrolled as follows:

        1. Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy

        2. Adjuvant radiation therapy without chemotherapy

      The enrollment goal for each group is 50 patients (total of 100 patients for the study). This
      calculation is based on the approximate number of 30 patients the investigators will need to
      achieve a sensitivity of β-endorphin changes of 5 pM being statistically significant to a
      p-value of&lt;0.05 with 95% power. Based in our finding in mice, the investigators expect
      β-endorphin levels to vary between individuals, and the investigators have increased sample
      size by 70% from our calculations to account for deviations from our β-endorphin levels
      estimations. Additionally, the investigators have added patients to account for a number of
      patient dropping out of the study, since this is a long trial for patients requiring multiple
      blood draws.

             irradiation.

          2. No planned chemotherapy for this tumor

        Eligibility for the RT + chemotherapy (CT) group will include:

          1. Planned 3-D conformal radiation therapy to the whole breast (2 tangential fields,
             unilateral or bilateral) via standard or Canadian fractionation (photons followed by a
             photon, electron, or mixed photon/electron boost), +/- regional nodal irradiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Continuous/chronic treatment with opiate/opioid analgesics for 3-6 months prior to
             enrollment. In addition, patients receiving radiation therapy alone who have taken
             opiate analgesics from their surgery within 72 hours of the post-surgery/pre-radiation
             therapy blood draw (at 1-6 weeks prior to the start of radiation therapy) will be
             removed from the study. Patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy who have
             taken opiate analgesics from their surgery within 72 hours of the blood draw prior to
             cycle 1 of chemotherapy will be removed from the study.

             Tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium, benzodiazepines,
             barbiturates, drugs acting on the 5-HT receptors. Patients meeting these criteria may
             still enroll in the study if they are on a chronic, stable, low-dose regimen for at
             least 3 months prior to enrollment, as determined by the on-site PIs and
             co-investigating physicians. Patients having to begin on a regimen of any of these
             medications while on the study may continue on the study.

             scores on the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI): Average score for question #s 1-4 &gt; 5;
             and/or Average score for question #s 5-11 &gt; 5. Patients with Hct&lt;33% but who have no
             baseline fatigue (as indicated by baseline scores on the FSI as follows: average score

             participate.

          7. Endocrine disorders that can cause fatigue: Addison's disease, uncorrected
             hypothyroidism (patients taking thyroid replacement therapy for at least 3 months

             within 3 months of cancer diagnosis or patients with previously stable thyroid disease
             who have experienced symptoms or have had to change their medication doses within 3
             months of cancer diagnosis. Patients with stable disease who have no had to change
             medication doses within 3 months of cancer diagnosis. Patients with stable disease who
             have not had to change medication doses within 3 months of cancer diagnosis may enroll
             as long as baseline fatigue scores do not meet criteria for exclusion. Patients
             enrolled in the study who have to alter doses of thyroid medications or who are newly
