    <textblock>
      To validate the use of Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) blood assay in
      subjects who are referred for the work-up of coronary artery disease. The study will evaluate
      the clinical utility of a gene expression test Corus CAD (Age, Sex, Gene Expression Score -
      ASGES) in subjects referred for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) work-up for suspected
      obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). The Corus CAD (ASGES) is a gene
      expression test that quantify the expression of multiple genes from circulating peripheral
      blood cells to detect the presence of clinically significant obstructive CAD in patients with
      chest pain.

      This prospective, multicenter study obtained peripheral blood samples for gene expression
      score (GES) before MPI in 537 consecutive patients Patients with abnormal MPI usually
      underwent invasive coronary angiography; all others had research coronary computed
      tomographic angiography, with core laboratories defining coronary anatomy A total of 431
      patients completed GES, coronary imaging (invasive coronary angiography or computed
      tomographic angiography), and MPI Mean age was 56±10 years (48% women) The prespecified
      primary end point was GES receiver-operating characteristics analysis to discriminate ≥50%
      stenosis (15% prevalence by core laboratory analysis) Area under the receiver-operating
      characteristics curve for GES was 0 79 (95% confidence interval, 0 73-0 84; P&lt;0 001), with
      sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of 89%, 52%, and 96%, respectively,
      at a prespecified threshold of ≤15 with 46% of patients below this score The GES outperformed
      clinical factors by receiver-operating characteristics and reclassification analysis and
      showed significant correlation with maximum percent stenosis. Six-month follow-up on 97% of
      patients showed that 27 of 28 patients with adverse cardiovascular events or
      revascularization had GES &gt;15 Site and core-laboratory MPI had areas under the curve of 0 59
      and 0 63, respectively, significantly less than GES.

    <description>The primary endpoint for the COMPASS study is to assess whether the Corus CAD (ASGES) gene expression test performance is superior to an AUC of 0.5. The endpoint will be evaluated based on the current gold standard test for CAD, invasive coronary angiography, or a research CCTA after the subjects have undergone both the Corus CAD (ASGES) and MPI tests. Superiority will be assessed based upon demonstration of p&lt;0.05 testing of the Corus CAD (ASGES) AUC versus an AUC of 0.50.</description>
