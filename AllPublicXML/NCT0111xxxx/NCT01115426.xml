    <textblock>
      This study evaluates prospectively the effects of an anti-angiotensin II regimen on renal
      outcome in patients with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis followed-up for 10 years.

    <textblock>
      After signing informed consent, enrolled patients started treatment with ACEi. We decided to
      prescribe to all patients the same drug (ramipril) at the same dosage (5 mg/day). All
      patients were examined every 2 months during the first year of follow-up and every 6 months
      thereafter. At each visit, they underwent a complete physical examination. If the target
      blood pressure of &lt;140/90 mmHg was not achieved with ramipril monotherapy, addition of other
      antihypertensive drug(s) was allowed. Patients complaining adverse side effects attributed to
      ramipril were switched to losartan (50 mg/day). The patients were also prescribed a normal
      protein (1 gram/kg/day) and moderately salt-restricted (6-8 grams/day) diet throughout the
      study.

    <description>In particular, the end points of the study were a loss &gt;20% of basal GFR and a decrease of basal daily proteinuria &lt; 20% at the end of first year of observation.
GFR was calculated using both the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and measured creatinine clearance. For each patient, a time-averaged (TA) proteinuria were calculated as an average of the mean of every-6month period's 24-hour proteinuria measurements.</description>
