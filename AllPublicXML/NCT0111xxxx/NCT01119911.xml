      We hypothesize that peripheral venous catheter used for fluid administration can replace
      venipuncture blood sampling for selected basic analytes and thus reduce pain in infants under
      2 years of age.

      Multiple venipunctures in hospitalized children result in physical and emotional distress.
      Recently, we have found that blood sampling via peripheral venous catheter used for fluid
      administration in children significantly reduces pain and, except for glucose, can replace
      venipuncture for determining complete blood count and basic chemistry analytics, including
      white and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, mean corpuscular volume,
      mean corpuscular hemoglobin level, red blood cell distribution width, platelet count, mean
      platelet volume, and sodium, potassium, chloride, and urea levels (Berger-Achituv S,
      Budde-Schwartzman B. Ellis MH, Shenkman Z. Erez I. Blood Sampling through Peripheral Venous
      Catheters for Selected Basic Analytes in Children. Pediatrics. In press).

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether blood sampling via peripheral venous
      catheter used for fluid administration can significantly reduces pain and replace
      venipuncture for determining complete blood count and basic chemistry analytics in infants
      under 2 years of age.

    <description>Venipuncture is performed on the opposite limb of the peripheral venous catheter. Within 3 minutes, a second sample is taken from existing peripheral venous catheter used for fluid administration. Intravenous fluids are then stopped for 30 seconds and a tourniquet applied proximal to the device for another 30 seconds. A 2-mL syringe is attached and 0.5 mL of blood aspirated and discarded. Thereafter, 2 mL blood is slowly drawn during about 15 seconds, into a different 2-mL syringe, to allow a gentle pumping action that may reduce vacuum in the syringe and thus hemolysis rates. Afterwards, the intravenous device is flushed with 2 mL normal saline and infusion restarted.</description>
