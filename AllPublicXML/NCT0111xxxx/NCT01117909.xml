  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to determine if standard therapy including joint mobilizations of the ankle
      performed 3 times per week for 2 weeks will increase self-reported function and decrease pain
      in patients with mild lateral ankle sprains.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to assess the effects of grade IV anterior to posterior joint
      mobilization on self-reported function, dorsiflexion range of motion and talar glide on
      subjects suffering from lateral ankle sprain in the past 2-10 days and exhibit 5 degree
      dorsiflexion deficit in range of motion or a restriction in posterior glide of the talus.

    <description>Subjects will lie on their back as if they were receiving the joint mobilization treatment and the therapist will place their hands in a position as if to perform the mobilization but no movement will occur. Standard therapy will consist of ankle strengthening exercises with elastic bands, balance, active ROM, and 20 minutes of ice bag application, elevation and compression</description>

    <description>This group will receive three 60-second bouts of posterior joint mobilizations applied to the ankle joint during each treatment session, in addition to standard therapy.
