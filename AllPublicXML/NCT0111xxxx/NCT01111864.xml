  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants and children under two years are the group with the highest rates of iron deficiency
      anemia. Provision of sufficient dietary iron to this age group is a challenge, and in-home
      iron fortification of complementary foods using micronutrient powders can be an effective
      approach. However, WHO has recently cautioned against untargeted use of in-home micronutrient
      powders that contain the entire iron RDA for a child in a single dose in areas with high
      rates of infections from malaria and diarrheal disease. Therefore, in this study, we will
      investigate the effect on the infant gut microbiota of a low dose (ca. 25% of the RDA) of
      highly bioavailable iron, provided by a micronutrient powder added to a complementary food.

      The study aim is to determine if in-home fortification using an iron-containing micronutrient
      powder in Kenyan infants will improve iron status and/or modify the composition and metabolic
      activity of the gut microbiota. Active surveillance will be done weekly to monitor the health
      of the infants.

      Our study will be done in a subgroup (n=160) of a larger double-blind controlled feeding
      trial in which 330 infants will be randomized to receive a micronutrient powder containing
      either 2.5 mg iron or no iron for 1 year. In our substudy, the infants will be studied only
      over the first 6 months of the 1 year intervention. Blood samples, taken at baseline and
      after 6 months will be used to define the iron status and the anemia level of the infants.
      Stool samples (2 at baseline before intervention, 6 throughout the study and additional
      samples in case of diarrhea) will be obtained for analysis of the gut microbiota. In the
      entire study (n=330), we will measure changes in iron status over 1 year.
