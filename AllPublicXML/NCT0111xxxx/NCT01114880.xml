    <textblock>
      Study of the efficacy and safety of adalimumab compared with placebo in adult Chinese
      participants with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to or who
      are intolerant to one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive
      treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) or matching placebo, given
      subcutaneously (SC), in the 12-week double-blind (DB) phase. Randomized participants received
      one SC injection of the appropriate DB study medication (adalimumab 40 mg or matching
      placebo) at Week 0 and then eow until Week 10. Participants who completed the DB phase could
      enter the 12-week open-label (OL) phase, during which all participants received treatment
      with adalimumab 40 mg eow, starting at Weeks 12 through 22. No study drug was administered or
      injected at the final study visit (Week 24). A follow-up visit occurred 70 days after the
      last dose of study drug (in DB or OL phases) to obtain information on any ongoing or new
      adverse events (AEs).

    <description>A BASDAI50 responder had at least a 50% improvement from Baseline in BASDAI score.

How long does your morning stiffness last from the time you wake up?) Responses range from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;very severe&quot; or from 0 hours to 2 or more hours for morning stiffness.

Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a better health state.</description>
