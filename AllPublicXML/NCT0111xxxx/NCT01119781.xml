  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose
      of PEGylated Interferon Beta-1a (BIIB017) administered subcutaneous in participants with
      renal impairment and in participants with normal renal function (healthy participants). A
      secondary objective of this study in this study population is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a single dose of PEGylated Interferon Beta-1a administered subcutaneous.

      This study is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, serial-group study to estimate the
      effect of renal impairment on BIIB017 PK/PD. The study will be conducted at approximately 3
      sites in the US and will enroll approximately 35 participants: 6 healthy volunteers (normal
      renal function), 9 with mild renal impairment, 6 with moderate renal impairment, 8 with
      severe renal impairment, and 6 participants with end stage renal disease who require
      hemodialysis 2 to 3 times a week.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have stable renal disease (i.e., no change in disease status within the
             last month) as determined by the Investigator with laboratory and clinical findings
             that support the diagnosis of renal impairment.

          -  Must have body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2 inclusive.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically unstable (in the past 6 months prior to screening) cardiac,
             endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, dermatologic, and psychiatric, or other major disease as determined by the
             Investigator.

          -  Any evidence of clinically significant findings on screening evaluations, which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator would pose a safety risk, or would interfere with
             appropriate interpretation of safety or PK data, or other unspecified reasons that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen Idec, make the subject unsuitable for
             enrollment
