    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      VFIX device in maintaining vaginal apical support for at least 6 months in women with
      symptomatic apical prolapse (upper vaginal or uterine prolapse).

      Assuming success of the VFIX anatomical observational study (protocol 300-08-009), in this
      pilot study approximately 20 subjects (excluding the Device Run-In (DRI) subjects) will
      undergo the VFIX procedure to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VFIX device in
      maintaining apical support for at least 6 months, in women with symptomatic apical prolapse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

             prior to the procedure and subject has completed childbearing

          -  Subject with apical prolapse at stage II or more and requiring treatment (C should be
             at least -1 cm)

          -  On reduction of the apical prolapse, leading edge of prolapse should be at or above
             the hymen

          -  If applicable, subject has small/normal size uterus and there is no elongation of the
             cervix as determined by clinical assessment

          -  The vaginal apex can reach the Sacrospinous Ligament (SSL) on exam

          -  Subjects are allowed concurrent incontinence procedure as required

          -  Concurrent perineal repairs and excision of excess vaginal tissue repairs as required

          -  Agrees to participate in the study, including completion of all study-related
             procedures, evaluations and questionnaires, and documents this agreement by signing
             the Ethics Committee approved informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Additional surgical intervention for POP repairs concurrent to the VFIX procedure
             (including, but not limited to sacrocolpopexy, paravaginal repair, colporrhaphy, mesh
             repair, etc)

          -  Experimental drug or experimental medical device within 3 months prior to the planned
             procedure

          -  Active genital, urinary or systemic infection at the time of the surgical procedure.
             Surgery may be delayed in such subjects until the infection is cleared.

          -  Previous hysterectomy within 6 months of scheduled surgery.

          -  Coagulation disorder or on therapeutic anticoagulant therapy (except aspirin) at the
             time of surgery

          -  Nursing or pregnant

          -  Presence of cancers of the vagina, cervix, or uterus

          -  In the investigator's opinion, any medical condition or psychiatric illness that could
             potentially be life threatening or affect their ability to complete the study visits
             according to this protocol
