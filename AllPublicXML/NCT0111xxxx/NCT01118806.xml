      the study aims to messure the vitamin D levels in medical staff in the hospital. The
      physicians in the course of their internship who work indoors and work many night shifts have
      limited sun exposure in all seasons. Nursing staff who work shifts and work indoors are at
      the same risk of liltle sun exposure. The study addresses the amount of sun exposure,
      assessed by a sun exposure questioner, age, gender,work load related to number of shifts in
      the physicien group and in nursing group the job percentile we also adress religion (clothing
      cover)as a factor.

      The population in Israel is heterogeneous in the aspect of skin exposure to the sun. Women in
      the Moslem community with traditional long sleeve dress code whose sun exposure to the sun
      even in the summer months is limited.

      The physicians in the course of their internship who work indoors and work many night shifts
      and nurses with their shift work have limited sun exposure in all seasons.

      The study addresses the amount of sun exposure, assessed by a sun exposure questioner, age,
      gender,number of shifts in the physicien group and in nursing group the job percentile
      religion (clothing cover).

      The standard for measuring vitamin D status is 25(OH) D levels in the serum. The staff
      members from which blood will be drawn will be have an explanation about the aim of the study
      and will sign an informed consent.
