      During this study the investigators will compare the use of two treadmill tests in people
      diagnosed with cancer. The STEEP treadmill protocol is often used to evaluate the endurance
      of people diagnosed with cancer, however, since it is based on step increases in speed or
      ramp, it may not related to normal function. The new test, which is based on the body
      response to increased activity has not been used with people with cancer but may provide a
      better approximation of endurance demands during daily function. Our question is whether the
      new treadmill test can be used to evaluate aerobic function with people with cancer better
      than the STEEP treadmill test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are required to be adults (age 16 or over),

          -  Diagnosed with cancer, at any stage of treatment (during or after treatment),

          -  Able to follow instructions in English, and provide informed consent.

          -  Participants need to be considered &quot;well&quot; to participate. A &quot;well participant&quot; has
             been defined as a cancer survivor who is living at home, able to ambulate
             independently without a gait aid (single point cane is acceptable), has no acute
             medical conditions, and passes pre-exercise safety screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cancer survivors with metastatic disease.

          -  Cancer survivors who are defined as unwell.
