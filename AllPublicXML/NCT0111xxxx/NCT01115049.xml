      Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a new mouthwash in treating oral
      lesions due to removable prostheses.

      Methods: The present prospective randomized clinical trial was performed on 44 patients. The
      experimentation lasted for 4 weeks and 4 operators participated. The effects of the mouthwash
      were evaluated subjectively and objectively, with questionnaires, Visual Analogic Scales and
      clinical examinations. The results were statistically analyzed. The following variables were
      recorded: presence of mucosal lesions due to incongruous removable prostheses and lasting of
      pain after rinsing.

      The aim of the present prospective, randomized, triple-blind controlled clinical trial was to
      evaluate the efficacy of an innovative mouthwash (emulsion) in the treatment of lesions of
      oral mucosae due to removable prostheses. The tested preparation contained two active
      molecules: a topical antiseptic (0.1% hexetidine) and a local anesthetic (0.5%
      chlorobutanol).
