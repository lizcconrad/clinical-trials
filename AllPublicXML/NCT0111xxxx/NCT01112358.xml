  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomised, comparative with parallel control, Phase 2 exploratory
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of mid follicular Luveris in 60 women at risk of poor
      response undergoing COS prior to ICSI with Gonal-f and Cetrotide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large protocols have been dedicated to overcome the problem of poor ovarian response and
      encouraging results have obtained. This proposal was to complement COS with follitropin alfa
      by adding lutropin alfa at the time of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist
      administration to prevent endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) surge. The reasons were:

        -  Recombinant-follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH) will promote follicular growth and by
           aromatase activation will stimulate estradiol (E2)synthesis.

        -  Recombinant-human LH (r-hLH) besides acting on theca cells to provide androgens to be
           converted to E2, will finalize the maturation of granulosa cells from developed
           follicles and, at the same time, will produce atresia of less developed follicles
           lacking of mature granulosa cells.

        -  The use of GnRH antagonist strongly suppresses serum LH levels thus the exogenous
           administration of lutropin alfa.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess the efficacy of the simultaneous addition GnRH antagonist and r-hLH versus no
           addition of r-hLH, in subjects at risk of poor response aged &lt; 38 years undergoing COS
           with r-hFSH prior to ICSI, in terms of oocyte number and quality as well as follicular
           development, oocyte fertilisation, embryo quality and pregnancy rates

        -  To assess the safety of using r-hLH in combination with r-hFSH in a protocol of COS with
           GnRH antagonist, including incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and
           adverse events (AEs) as well as local tolerance.

      The study was organised on an outpatient basis. All subjects underwent COS according to
      centre´s standard protocol (but Luveris) when a GnRH antagonist was going to be used. The COS
      was started on day 2-3 of the cycle with an initial dose of follitropin alfa ranging from 225
      to 450 IU/day depending on subjects' baseline profile. Then the daily dose was adjusted
      according to ovarian response. When detected a follicle ≥ 14 mm or serum E2 levels &gt; 200
      pg/ml, then both 0.25 mg/day of Cetrotide and 150 IU/day of Luveris were initiated.
      Randomisation to Luveris supplementation or not took place at any time between the fourth day
      of COS (S4) and the first dose of Cetrotide, which were administered in the morning. Once COS
      completed, follitropin alfa, lutropin alfa, and Cetrorelix were stopped and recombinant-human
      choriogonadotropin (r-hCG) administered within the following 24 hours. Standard criteria for
      r-hCG administration were the presence of at least of one follicle ≥18 mm and two addition
      follicles &gt; 16 mm together with appropriate E2 levels for the follicular number and size.
