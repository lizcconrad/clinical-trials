      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended release (ER)
      tramadol hydrochloride (HCl)/acetaminophen compared with placebo in participants with chronic
      (lasting a long time) low-back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers nor the
      participants know what treatment the participants is receiving), randomized (study drug is
      assigned by chance), placebo-controlled, parallel group (a medical research study comparing
      the response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving different interventions
      [treatments]) and up-titration study in participants with chronic low back pain. The study
      will consist of 6 visits (Day -7 to Day -1 [Visit 1], Day 1 [Visit 2], Day 3 [telephone
      visit], Day 8 [Visit 3], Day 15 [Visit 4] and Day 29 [Visit 5]) and 2 phases: a screening
      phase and treatment phase. Screening phase will be of 7 days during which, participants will
      receive stable dose of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or COX-2 selective
      inhibitors (NSAID that specifically inhibits an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase-2) for pain
      therapy. On the basis of average pain intensity over the last 48 hours which will be measured
      at baseline (at the end of screening period), participants will enter the treatment phase.
      Treatment phase will be of 28 days which includes 7-days of dose titration period. In
      treatment phase all participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatments:
      tramadol HCl 75 milligram (mg)/acetaminophen 650 mg ER tablet treatment or the equivalent
      placebo (an inactive substance) treatment until study completion, Day 29. Participants will
      receive 1 tablet of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen ER or its equivalent placebo, once daily for 3
      days. After the first 3 days, the participants will receive a telephone inquiry monitoring
      the occurrence of adverse events and will be given additional administration instructions for
      the next 4 days (1 tablet twice daily for 4 days). From Day 7, participants will receive 1 or
      2 tablets twice a day depending on the degree of pain relief required. Participants will
      visit the center on the Day 8 (Visit 3), Day 15 (Visit 4), and Day 29 (Visit 5) after
      starting study drug. The efficacy will be assessed by measuring extent of reduction in pain
      intensity on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Reduction in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with extent of reduction in pain intensity greater than or equal to 30 percent was reported. Pain intensity change rate was calculated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at baseline minus VAS score at Day 29 divided by VAS score at Baseline. VAS is a 10 centimeter (cm) scale. Intensity of pain range: 0 cm=no pain to 10 cm=worst possible pain.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain intensity experienced by participants over the last 48 hours was measured on Day 29 against Baseline with VAS. VAS is a 10 cm scale. Intensity of pain range: 0 cm=no pain to 10 cm=worst possible pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 15 and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was measured in 6 stages to assess the participant's pain relief. Extent of pain relief was measured on a scale ranging from 4 to -1, where 4=complete disappearance, 3=fair relief, 2=moderate relief, 1=slight relief, 0=no change and -1=pain worsening. Relief more than 'slight relief (1)' was considered as pain relief success.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form (SF)-36 Score at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life of participants was evaluated by SF-36 Korean version questionnaire. It is composed of 8 domains: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. Participants answered to the questionnaire of 36 questions; and physical, social, and psychological health status were assessed. It ranges 0 to 100, and higher score indicates better quality of life, But in &quot;Reported (Rptd.) Health Transition&quot; domain higher score indicates worse quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Korean Version Score at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI Korean version was used to assess the participant's functionality. The ODI is a low back pain-specific, validated instrument that consists of questions related to limitations in performing specific activities of daily living and 1 question related to pain intensity. The ODI is a self-administered questionnaire consists of 10 sections. Each section consists of 6 statements ranked from 0 to 5 (0=good to 5=worse). Total score is the sum of score obtained in each section and ranges from 0 to 50. A higher score represents greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment on Investigational Product</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Global assessment on investigational product was done by investigator on how well the investigational product controlled chronic (lasting a long time) low back pain. Assessment was done by categories 'Very bad (-2)' 'Bad (-1)' 'Not changed (0) 'Good (1)' and 'Very good (2)'. Assessment better than &quot;Good&quot; was considered as pain improvement success. Percentage of participants with pain improvement success is reported here.</description>

          <description>The ODI Korean version was used to assess the participant's functionality. The ODI is a low back pain-specific, validated instrument that consists of questions related to limitations in performing specific activities of daily living and 1 question related to pain intensity. The ODI is a self-administered questionnaire consists of 10 sections. Each section consists of 6 statements ranked from 0 to 5 (0=good to 5=worse). Total score is the sum of score obtained in each section and ranges from 0 to 50. A higher score represents greater disability.</description>
