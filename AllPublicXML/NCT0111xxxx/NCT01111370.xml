      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the G4 System when
      worn for up to 7-days by subjects &gt;18 years-old with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin.

      Device performance will be primarily evaluated in terms of the proportion of G4 System values
      that are within ±20% of YSI reference value for glucose levels &gt;80 mg/dL and ±20 mg/dL at
      meter glucose levels &lt;80 mg/dL. These G4-YSI matched pairs will be collected during in-clinic
      sessions on Days 1, 4, and 7 of Sensor wear. The proportion of matched pairs from this study
      (PTL-900360) meeting the above criteria will be compared to the proportion of such points
      observed in the DexCom clinical study that supported approval of the SEVEN PLUS System (PTL
      300012).

      Safety data of the G4 System will also be collected and safety will be characterized by the
      incidence of Adverse Device Effects, Serious Adverse Device Events, and Unanticipated Adverse
      Device Effects experienced by study participants.

      This will be a non-randomized, single-armed study conducted in the United States. Following
      screening, a minimum of 60 to a maximum of 80 subjects at up to 4 clinical sites will be
      enrolled. All participants will wear the G4 Sensor for one 7-day wear period (~168 hours). A
      subset of 20-30 subjects will wear two G4 Systems (one of which will be blinded) during the
      7-day wear period for the purposes of assessing precision. During home use, subjects will be
      asked to use the meter provided to them to take fingersticks for calibration and diabetes
      management. Subjects will also be asked to confirm high and low G4 System glucose
      alerts/alarms by taking a comparative fingerstick immediately after receiving an alert/alarm.

      All subjects will participate in one, 8-hour in-clinic session on Day 1, 4, or 7 of the study
      to collect accuracy information against a laboratory standard (YSI) and against SMBG. During
      the in-clinic session, subjects will have venous blood draws for evaluation of the YSI blood
      glucose measurements. Carbohydrate consumption and insulin dosing may be manipulated during
      the in-clinic session to ensure a wide range of glucose values. For the duration of this
      study, subjects will be instructed to use G4 System information as an adjunct to (and not as
      a replacement for) standard SMBG guidance of diabetes self-management.

      Subjects will perform G4 Sensor insertions at the clinic under supervision of study staff.
      Sensor insertion sites will be examined after removal of the Sensor(s). Study staff will
      document any irritation and/or Adverse Device Effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older;

          2. Have been diagnosed with insulin-requiring diabetes and are on multiple daily
             injections (MDI) or Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) insulin therapy;

          3. Willing not to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump insertion set within 3 inches
             from the Sensor site during Sensor wear;

          4. Willing to use only the blood glucose meter provided to them for self-monitoring of
             blood glucose (SMBG) during Sensor wear;

          5. Willing to participate in one, 8-hour in-clinic session and be willing to take 4
             fingersticks per hour and have 4 blood draws per hour for the entire 8-hour duration;

          6. Willing to take a minimum of 6 fingersticks per day during home use (2 for calibration
             purposes, 4 for comparative purposes);

          7. Willing to refrain from the use of acetaminophen during the Sensor insertion period
             and for at least 24-hours prior to Sensor insertion;

             scan, or x-ray, for the duration of the study;

             (e.g. extensive psoriasis, recent burns or severe sunburn, extensive eczema, extensive
             scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis herpetiformis) at the proposed wear sites;

          2. Subjects who have a known allergy to medical-grade adhesives;

          4. Have a hematocrit that is less than 30%, or greater than 55%;

          5. Current participation in another investigational study protocol (if a subject has
             recently completed participation in another drug study, the subject must have
             completed that study at least 30 days prior to being enrolled in this study);
