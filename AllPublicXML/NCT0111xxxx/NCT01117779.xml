  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TRACE is an observational, open-label, single-arm, multi-center registry of subjects who have
      undergone renal lesion cryoablation per their physician's standard of care. Patients 18 years
      of age or older who have been determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation will
      be offered enrollment into the registry. Subjects will be observed for five years from the
      date of their cryoablation procedure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry is non-interventional; it will neither direct the cryoablation procedures
      performed nor define the post-surgery follow-up of each subject. A subject's participation in
      the registry will not influence or direct subject treatment procedures or follow-up care.
      Physicians will use their discretion and personal standards of care to select subjects,
      perform the cryoablation procedures and define appropriate follow-up visit schedules for
      their subjects; it is anticipated that subjects will be seen at least once per year during
      the five-year follow-up period of TRACE. Subjects may be followed by the physician performing
      the cryoablation procedure or by their local/personal physician. The enrolling physician will
      be responsible for providing the follow-up data to the registry and will, as appropriate,
      work with a subject's local/personal physician to collect the follow-up data.
