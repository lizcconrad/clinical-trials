  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol is one of the most widely used analgesics in the world especially for chronic
      pain in the elderly. The metabolism of paracetamol occurs in the liver and involves the use
      of glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine (Glutathione (GSH)). Medications such as paracetamol, may
      reduce the reserves of GSH because it is used for detoxification and elimination. It is well
      known that the concentration of GSH decrease after administration of paracetamol in humans
      and animals.

      Aging is associated with decreased concentration of GSH in cells and tissues. In the elderly,
      a decrease of GSH concentration in plasma or red blood cells is associated with decreased
      physical and mental health.

      We wish here to determine, in subjects aged over 70 years, the blood concentration of
      glutathione (GSH) and urinary loss of cysteine in the detoxification of paracetamol, when
      taking paracetamol treatment repeated.
