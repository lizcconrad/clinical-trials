    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled pilot trial in 70 patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (ARDS) ventilated with low tidal volumes and limitation on airway pressure at 35 centimeters
      of water (cmH2O), to compare two different methods of selecting the level of Positive
      End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) to be applied: according to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
      needed or individualized according to the best compliance. Primary objective was evolution of
      arterial oxygenation during the 28 days. Secondary objectives were to measure its effects on
      hemodynamic parameters, 28-day mortality, number of ventilator-free days at day 28, Intensive
      Care Unit (ICU) and hospital stay, number of multiple-organ dysfunction-free days and a
      multivariate analysis of 28 day-mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome the use of Positive End-Expiratory
      Pressure (PEEP) avoids atelectrauma, improves gas exchange and induces alveolar
      recruitment.Although it has side effects as inducing alveolar overdistension and circulatory
      depression.

      There are several methods to determine the level of PEEP to be applied. We conducted a study
      to test the hypothesis that an individualized level of PEEP, set et the best compliance, when
      compared with a fixed level according to the fraction of inspired oxygen applied, improves
      oxygenation and reduces mortality rate at 28 days.

    <description>Positive End-Expiratory Pressure(PEEP) level was set daily, according to the method described by Suter in 1978. Static compliance (Cst) was calculated at different levels of PEEP at a constant tidal ventilation of 6-8 ml/kg of predicted body weight. Cst was determined by dividing tidal volume by the difference between the pressure at the end of inflation hold and the PEEP. The maximum value of Cst in individual patients was considered as the best PEEP.</description>
