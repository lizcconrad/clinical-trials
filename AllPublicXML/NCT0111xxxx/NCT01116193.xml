  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the oral administration of
      lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in the treatment of adult patients with
      refractory or relapsed non-Ph+ B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two periods, an initial treatment period and an extended treatment
      period. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will receive: Lenalidomide 25 mg p.o. once
      daily on days 1-21 plus Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each
      28-day cycle (4-weeks cycles) until CR achievement, progression of disease or intolerable
      toxicity. The daily dose of Lenalidomide and that of Dexamethasone will remain fixed. No dose
      adaptations are allowed according to the hematologic toxicity. However, in case of
      non-hematologic grade &gt; 2 toxicity, the next cycle may be delayed up to 21 days after the
      onset of the event until the adverse event has returned to baseline or ≤ grade 1. Patients
      may be allowed to receive a pre-treatment with high doses of dexamethasone for initial
      hyperleukocytosis at the discretion of the investigator. The use of hematopoietic growth
      factor (HGF) during the initial or extended treatment period is also let at the discretion of
      the investigator. At the end of the initial treatment period, all responding patients
      (without HLA compatible donor) or patients showing sufficient clinical activity will be
      allowed to receive extended treatment with cycles identical to the first cycle. Patients may
      continue to receive treatment as long as the patient is tolerating the treatment well and the
      patient's physician believes the patient is receiving some benefit. The severity of adverse
      events will be graded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Any
      life-threatening adverse effects that are observed during the initial or extended treatment
      period, which are possibly or probably related to study drug, will require the subject to
      discontinue study treatment.

               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused
                  study drug to the investigator

        Female subjects of childbearing potential must :

          -  Understand that the study medication is expected to have a teratogenic risk

          -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout the entire duration of
             study drug therapy (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of
             study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject
             commits to absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The
             following are effective methods of contraception

               -  Implant

               -  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot

               -  Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be
                  confirmed by two negative semen analyses

               -  Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

               -  If not established on effective contraception, the female subject must be
                  referred to an appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive
                  advice in order that contraception can be initiated

          -  Understand that even if she has amenorrhea, she must follow all the advice on
             effective contraception.

             mIU/mL on the day of the study visit or in the 3 days prior to the study visit once
             the subject has been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This requirement
             also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued
             abstinence. The test should ensure the subject is not pregnant when she starts
             treatment

          -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks
             after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization.

        Criteria for women of non-childbearing potential

        potential unless she meets at least one of the following criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer
             therapy does not rule out childbearing potential.)

          -  Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist

          -  Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy
