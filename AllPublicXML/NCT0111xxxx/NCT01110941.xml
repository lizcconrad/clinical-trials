  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine with demonstrated efficacy on gastric cancer and colorectal
      cancer. The new regimen with Oxaliplatin and leucovorin is expected to achieve more
      encouraging efficacy on colorectal cancer. This study is to explore the feasibility of the
      SOL regimen on efficacy and tolerability on Chinese colorectal cancer patients.
