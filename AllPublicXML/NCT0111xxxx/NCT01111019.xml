        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female children with hypochondroplasia defined by a disproportional short limb
             height and a X-ray evidence of shortening of the long bones and failure of increase in
             the interpedicular distance between lumbar vertebrae L1 and L5

          -  Result of genetic analysis for mutation of gene FGFR3 already known or ongoing
             analysis at the beginning of the study

          -  Previous or ongoing treatment with any therapy that may directly influence growth,
             including Growth Hormone (GH), Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) and long
             duration corticosteroids therapy
