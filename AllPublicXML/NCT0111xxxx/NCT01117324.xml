  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone density was found to be impaired among lage babies and infants of diabetic mothers as
      found in small group studies. The assumption is that large weight decreases fetal movements
      and causes decreased bone mineralization.The aim of the study is to compare 2 study groups -
      of large infants and infants of diabetic mothers to each other and to controls.
