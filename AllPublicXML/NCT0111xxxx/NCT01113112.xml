      The purpose of this study is to understand relationships between behavioral factors,
      hormones, and chemicals produced by the body that may help tumor growth in ovarian cancer.

    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer. Because of low rates of survival
      for the majority of ovarian cancer patients, identification of factors contributing to tumor
      progression is of paramount importance. Epidemiologic studies have suggested an association
      between biobehavioral factors such as life stress, depression, low social support and cancer
      progression. Direct links have been demonstrated between biobehavioral factors and cytokines
      supporting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that enhance tumor growth and
      progression. However, little is known regarding tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and
      interactions between TAM tumor cells in a way that favors tumor growth, but there is
      preliminary data indicating that ovarian cancer patients with higher levels of depressive
      symptoms and life stress have greater TAM production of matrix metalloproteinase-9, a key
      molecule promoting angiogenesis and tumor invasion. We also have preliminary data that
      ovarian cancer patients with high levels of depressive symptoms accompanied by low social
      support have greater tumor expression of a number of genes related to inflammation and tumor
      progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
             carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer; FIGO stage I to IV defined surgically at the
             completion of the initial abdominal surgery and with appropriate tissue available for
             histologic evaluation.

          -  Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma not
             otherwise specified. However, the histologic features must be compatible with primary
             Mullerian epithelial adenocarcinoma.

          -  GOG performance status 0-3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (formerly: tumors of
             low malignant potential&quot; or recurrent invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal,
             or fallopian tube cancer treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy previously are
             excluded.

          -  Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
             fallopian tube carcinoma are excluded.

          -  Non-epithelial ovarian cancers or metastases to the ovaries from organs are excluded.

          -  Previous cancer diagnosis except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin or history of
             lymphoma.

          -  Pregnancy or age &lt;18 years old

          -  Use of systemic glucocorticoids such as prednisone or decadron in the last 30 days

          -  Comorbid conditions: Addison's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis
             C, AIDS or HIV, lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid
             arthritis.

          -  Inability to accurately answer questions (e.g. a condition such as dementia)
