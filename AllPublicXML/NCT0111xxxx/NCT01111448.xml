      The goal of this Pilot-study is to evaluate the response of unselected MDS patients to
      temsirolimus a drug approved for the treatment of renal cell cancer. It is planned to give
      temsirolimus at a weekly dose of 25 mg as intravenous infusion for a maximum duration of 12
      months. Regular bone marrow biopsies are planned for controlling MDS response.

          -  Age &gt;18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form;

          -  Patients able to understand the consequences of participating in this trial and not
             having any disorders or other circumstances (i.e. being in ward or imprisoned) which
             keeps them from giving written informed consent;

          -  cytologically or histologically established diagnosis of de novo or therapy-related
             MDS according to the FAB-classification, either previously treated or untreated,
             presenting with:

               -  Group I (low-risk): Low- or INT-1 risk features according to IPSS and requiring
                  at least 4 units of red blood cells within the last 8 weeks prior to screening
                  visit or presenting with neutropenia (&lt;1 Gpt/l neutrophils) or

               -  Group II (high-risk): INT-2 or HIGH-risk IPSS refractory or intolerant to
                  5-Azacytidine.

        CMML patients of dysplastic phenotype (WBC &lt; 13 Gpt/l) may be included in both arms
        according to IPSS. CMML patients showing proliferative phenotype (WBC &gt;=13 Gpt/l) will be
        included in the high risk arm;

          -  not eligible for an immediate allogeneic HSCT or conventional chemotherapy;

          -  all previous MDS specific therapies (except supportive approaches like transfusions or
             antibiotics) must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment;

          -  ECOG performance status of &lt;= 3 at study entry;

          -  laboratory test results within these ranges:

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;= 177 µmo/l (&lt;= 2.0 mg/dL);

               -  total bilirubin &lt;= 3 x ULN;

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;= 3 x ULN;

                  Risk according to IPSS;

          -  signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For Patients with LOW- or INT1-Risk according to IPSS: Thrombocytopenia below 25 Gpt/l
             (INT2- and HIGH-IPSS patients may be included irrespective of platelet count);

          -  known hypersensitivity to temsirolimus, sirolimus or any components of the infusion

             80, polyethylene glycol 400, dehydrated alcohol);

          -  known hypersensitivity to macrolid antibiotics (because of structural similarities
             between this class of antibiotics and study medication);

          -  any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study;

          -  known positive for HIV or any other uncontrolled infection;

          -  presence of any other malignancy being not in complete remission for at least 3 years
             (previous chemotherapy for other malignancies is not an exclusion criteria);

                  hysterectomy);regular and correct use of contraceptives with a PEARL Index of &lt;
                  1% (e.g. implants, depot formulations of hormones, oral contraceptives, intra
                  uterine device - IUD);

               -  sexual abstinence;
