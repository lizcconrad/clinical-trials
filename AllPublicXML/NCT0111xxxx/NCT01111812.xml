    <textblock>
      The 'Meir children's sport and health center' runs a multi-disciplinary intervention program
      for the treatment of overweight and obese children and adolescents. The program includes
      physical activity, dietary guidelines, medical supervision and behavioral treatment. The
      participants are routinely weighed once a week, at the same day and time, in order to
      supervise their progress. According to our experience, the child can predict his weight
      change, based on his &quot;behavior&quot; in the previous week. To our knowledge the overweight/obese
      child's ability to predict his weekly weight change, while participating in a
      multi-disciplinary intervention program, has never been tested.

      The aim of this study is to examine whether a child participating in a multi-disciplinary
      intervention program for treatment of the overweight and obese in Meir medical center, can
      predict his weight change during intervention before the actual weighing.

      This study will include 1000 weight measurements of children and adolescents, boys and girls,
      ages 5-18 years. A patient might be measured several times.

      The data will be collected during 6 mounts. in this period the program participants will be
      asked, discretely, before being weighed if, in there opinion, they had lost or gained weight
      in the past week, and how mach and why.
