  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this exploratory randomized controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of a
      disease specific Expert Patient Programme compared to usual care in patients with
      bronchiectasis. Hypothesis: Disease specific EPP will increase self efficacy compared to
      usual care.
