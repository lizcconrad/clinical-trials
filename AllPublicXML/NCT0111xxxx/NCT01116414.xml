      The purpose of this study is to develop an integrated view of molecular mechanisms underlying
      CF lung disease severity.

      BACKGROUND:

      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in CF transmembrane
      conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CF has multi-organ involvement, but respiratory disease is
      the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The median age of survival in CF is only 37
      years, but there is a broad range of disease severity in the lung, even among patients with
      identical CFTR genotypes, including deltaF508 homozygotes.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This project holds great promise for defining a robust molecular phenotype for CF lung
      disease, which relates to prognosis, and new targets for therapy. By using a large and
      well-defined population of deltaF508 homozygotes who also have whole genome single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) data, and by studying gene expression across the whole transcriptome in a
      large number of samples of two relevant tissues (respiratory epithelium and transformed
      lymphocytes), we will be uniquely positioned to develop an integrated view of molecular
      mechanisms underlying CF lung disease severity.
