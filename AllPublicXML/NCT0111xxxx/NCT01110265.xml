    <textblock>
      Research has consistently found attentional biases towards negative weight-related stimuli in
      individuals with eating disorders. It has been suggested that these biases may act as a
      vulnerability factor for the development and maintenance of body dissatisfaction and may
      therefore be an important target for intervention. Previous studies have demonstrated the
      capacity to modify the patterns of attention allocation to threatening stimuli in a variety
      of anxiety disorders, with a subsequent and sustained reduction in anxiety symptoms. Thus,
      the present study aimed at testing the efficacy of attention training in reducing attentional
      biases and eating disorder symptoms in individuals with elevated levels of body image
      disturbance and eating disorder symptomatology of clinical severity. Thirty-two participants
      were randomly allocated to receive eight sessions of a 10-minute computer task aimed at
      training their attention away from weight-related stimuli or a control placebo training
      condition. Results showed that participants in the attention training group had a
      significantly greater reduction in their attentional bias and body dissatisfaction from pre-
      to post-training relative to the placebo condition. At follow-up, both groups showed a
      significant decrease in body dissatisfaction from their pre-training levels. The only
      significant difference between groups in eating disorder symptoms at follow-up was in terms
      of the attention training group experiencing a greater reduction in weight and shape
      concerns.
