      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of zinc and/or vitamin A
      supplementation in reducing the risk of placental malaria and its associated adverse
      pregnancy outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria accounts for a major proportion of the disease burden in Tanzania with 14 to 18
      million new malaria cases being reported each year resulting in 100,000-125,000 deaths.
      Malaria results in impaired productivity for those between 15-55 years and lost learning
      opportunities in the 5-25 year age group. Dar es Salaam is characterized as an area with
      endemic and perennial malaria, with transmission occurring during the entire year. P.
      falciparum accounts for more than 95% of malaria infections. A number of interventions have
      contributed to reducing the burden of the disease in some settings in Tanzania and beyond,
      including vector control measures, bed nets, and prophylaxis and treatment of malaria.
      However, malaria remains a serious problem among pregnant women and children. We will examine
      the efficacy of micronutrient supplements as a means of enhancing immune response to malaria
      in pregnancy and reducing the risks of associated adverse clinical outcomes. If successful,
      such a low-cost intervention would be added to the armamentarium against this disease.

      NOTE: The time frames listed for the maternal malaria and hemoglobin outcomes were updated on
      4/22/15. This record initially indicated that maternal malaria anemia and hemoglobin would be
      measured at several specific time points throughout the study. Instead, maternal malaria was
      measured throughout pregnancy and hemoglobin was measured only at delivery. Due to an
      oversight, we did not update this record when this protocol change took effect at the start
      of the study.
