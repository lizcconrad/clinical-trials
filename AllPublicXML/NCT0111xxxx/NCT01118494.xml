    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) that results in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major
      international health problem. Many clinical markers such as urine protein or eGFR(evaluated
      glomerular filtration rate),can estimate the renal function, but not sensitive. As
      well-known, the crucial role of angiotensin II (AngII), the major effector of the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS), in the development of renal fibrosis that results in ESRD is
      widely recognized.Abundant researches find that intrarenal RAS takes an important role on the
      progression of CKD. At present, no clinical marker is available to evaluate intrarenal AngII
      activity because it is difficult to measure it directly in patients. So find and establish a
      bio-marker of local renal RAS activation maybe a breakthrough in early detection and
      treatment of CKD. Angiotensinogen(AGT) is the only known substrate for renin and the level of
      AGT in humans is close to Km value for renin. Thus , changes in AGT levels can control the
      activity of the RAS, and its up-regulation may lead to activity of Ang levels. Then we
      hypothesis that the AGT is a early bio-marker of local renal RAS activation as well as CKD.

      1. Screening: Select CKD(3-4) patients from outpatients, Urine routine examination and
           Renal B-mode ultrasonography and so on.

        2. Confirm: Sign consent with the patients who meet the inclusion criteria, then these
           patients are included in the study.

        3. Create patients records and complete related-inspections.

        4. Clinical follow-up: Follow-up once every six months, and we will record every patient's
           disease progress every time. Each follow-up, the patient needs to leave 5 ml blood
           samples and 20 ml of urine samples, used for the following study.

        5. Detection, Observation and Evaluation: Patients are divided into two groups according to
           AGT levels: higher than the normal group and the normal group. Observe the changes in
           eGFR of different group. Statistics judge whether AGT can be as a early warning
           indicators of renal function decline.
