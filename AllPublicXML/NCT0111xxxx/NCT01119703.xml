    <textblock>
      This study evaluated whether it is possible in healthy elderly participants to generate
      baseline biomarker-based prediction rules (PdR) for vaccine response (post baseline absolute
      serum antibody titer) using each of the protocol selected vaccines separately; and examined
      the rank correlation coefficients of pairs of post vaccination antibody titers within the
      same elderly individuals.

    <measure>Antibody Titer Responses to Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBV sAg) Vaccine, Measured and Predicted Based on Pre-vaccination Biomarkers in Healthy, Elderly Participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month after final vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy elderly participants were simultaneously vaccinated at baseline with hepatitis vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccine, and cholera vaccine. Antibody titers to HBV sAg were then measured 1 month after final vaccination, based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and are defined as standardized &quot;international units&quot; of reactivity converted from optical densities, transformed to natural log (ln). In order to predict antibody responses blood samples were collected prior to vaccination at baseline, to measure a wide variety of biomarkers by messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling, biochemical and flow cytometric assays. These biomarkers were then used in a machine-learning (random-forest based) model to predict antibody titers, transformed to natural log (ln).</description>

        <title>Antibody Titer Responses to Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBV sAg) Vaccine, Measured and Predicted Based on Pre-vaccination Biomarkers in Healthy, Elderly Participants.</title>
        <description>Healthy elderly participants were simultaneously vaccinated at baseline with hepatitis vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccine, and cholera vaccine. Antibody titers to HBV sAg were then measured 1 month after final vaccination, based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and are defined as standardized &quot;international units&quot; of reactivity converted from optical densities, transformed to natural log (ln). In order to predict antibody responses blood samples were collected prior to vaccination at baseline, to measure a wide variety of biomarkers by messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling, biochemical and flow cytometric assays. These biomarkers were then used in a machine-learning (random-forest based) model to predict antibody titers, transformed to natural log (ln).</description>

          <description>Healthy elderly participants were simultaneously vaccinated at baseline with hepatitis vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccine, and cholera vaccine. Antibody titers to HBV sAg were then measured 1 month after final vaccination, based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and are defined as standardized &quot;international units&quot; of reactivity converted from optical densities, transformed to natural log (ln). In order to predict antibody responses blood samples were collected prior to vaccination at baseline, to measure a wide variety of biomarkers by messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling, biochemical and flow cytometric assays. These biomarkers were then used in a machine-learning (random-forest based) model to predict antibody titers, transformed to natural log (ln).</description>

        <title>Antibody Titer Responses to Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBV sAg) Vaccine, Measured and Predicted Based on Early Post-vaccination Biomarkers in Healthy, Elderly Participants.</title>
        <description>Healthy elderly participants were simultaneously vaccinated at baseline with hepatitis vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccine, and cholera vaccine. Antibody titers to HBV sAg were then measured 1 month after final vaccination, based on ELISA, and are defined as standardized &quot;international units&quot; of reactivity converted from optical densities, transformed to natural log (ln). In order to predict antibody responses blood samples were collected at 7 days post-baseline vaccination to measure a wide variety of biomarkers by mRNA profiling, biochemical and flow cytometric assays. These biomarkers were then used in a machine-learning (random-forest based) model to predict antibody titers, transformed to natural log (ln).</description>

        <population>Healthy participants 65 years of age and older who were treated with all three vaccines, and had their post-vaccination titers measured. Results from comparing titers and biomarker responses between younger and older cohorts are exploratory, and therefore not reported.</population>

        <description>Healthy elderly participants were simultaneously vaccinated at baseline with hepatitis vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccine, and cholera vaccine. Antibody titers to cholera were then measured 3 weeks after final vaccination, based on ELISA, and are defined as standardized &quot;international units&quot; of reactivity converted from optical densities, transformed to natural log (ln). In order to predict antibody responses blood samples were collected 7 days post-baseline vaccination to measure a wide variety of biomarkers by mRNA profiling, biochemical and flow cytometric assays. These biomarkers were then used in a machine-learning (random-forest based) model to predict antibody titers, transformed to natural log(ln).</description>
