    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves debilitating symptoms of movement disorders when
      conventional medical therapies and novel surgical therapies fail. Despite the remarkable
      efficacy of DBS, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. There is controversy regarding
      whether the therapeutic effects of DBS are associated with inhibition or excitation of target
      neurons, the introduction of new activity into the network, or a combination of these
      mechanisms. Additionally, it is unclear why stimulus frequency plays an important role in the
      clinical response to therapy. The fundamental hypothesis of this proposal is that unilateral
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in PD alters neuronal activity in the bilateral basal
      ganglia-thalamic-cortical motor system in a manner that is dependent on stimulation
      frequency.
