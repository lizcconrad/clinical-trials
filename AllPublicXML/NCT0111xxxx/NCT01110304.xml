  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromio-clavicular (AC) joint dislocation corresponds to 8.6% of all joint dislocations and
      represents a major injury to the shoulder girdle. The nature of the treatment is decided
      according to the severity of the lesion.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the surgical treatment is required or not
      for type III AC joint dislocations.

    <measure>Functional results of injured shoulder on Constant score</measure>

    <description>Based on the patient's subjective and objective answers to the Constant and Murley questionnaire, data are collected and calculated over a 100 points to measure the functional score of the injured shoulder.
Also, to measure shoulder strength, the Isoforce system from MDS® is used.</description>

    <measure>Radiologic assessment on the Zanca and axillary views</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Zanca view allows control of the superior displacement. It will be expressed in percentage of the CC distance compared to the non-injured side.
Axillary view allows control of the posterior displacement. It will be expressed in percentage of the AC distance compared to the non-injured side.
Both views will assess degenerative changes, subacromial osteolysis, distal clavicle osteolysis (all expressed in percentage of patients per group).</description>

    <description>Patients selected for this treatment will wear a light brace for pain release and analgesics will be prescribed. They can move the elbow, the wrist and the fingers immediately. After two weeks, they will begin a training program to restore shoulder motion and strength, and they will be asked to take off the brace progressively. They are allowed to start working and sporting activities when they feel comfortable.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hook plate by Synthes</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient is in a beach-chair position with injured arm slightly out of the table, on a bracket. The incision is longitudinal, from the distal third of the clavicle to the lateral border of the acromion. The deltoid is detached anteriorly to present the clavicle and the AC joint. The width of the hook depends on the depth of the acromion. The plate will always be 5 holes 3.5mm hook plate (Synthes®), left or right. The hook is inserted after visual reduction of the AC joint at the posterior border of the distal end of the clavicle, under the acromion. Reduction is then maintained by a davier and fixation with three 3,5mm cortical screws is achieved. After washing, deltoid is reinserted. CC ligaments are not directly repaired. Wound closure and bracing for two weeks.</description>
