  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled non-blinded double arm study examining the effect of
      routine postoperative oral antibiotic therapy in preventing postoperative surgical site
      infections after breast reconstruction. The investigators hypothesize that use of
      prophylactic antibiotics after breast reconstruction does not reduce surgical site
      infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections occur in up to one-third of patients who undergo implant-based
      breast reconstruction following mastectomy for cancer; most of such cases require subsequent
      prosthetic removal. This elevated risk relative to other surgical procedures and patient
      populations has been attributed to cancer-related immunocompromise, foreign body placement,
      postoperative drainage tube maintenance, and chemoradiotherapy administration. The use of
      extended postoperative prophylactic antibiotics is prevalent amongst plastic surgeons despite
      lack of evidence supporting efficacy of such practice. Further, the National Surgical Care
      Initiative Project (SCIP) as sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)
      mandates discontinuation of antibiotics by 24 hours after surgery, as further extension not
      only fails to reduce infection risk in the general surgical population, but also may
      contribute to bacterial resistance. The primary objective of this study is to compare the
      risk of surgical site infection in implant-reconstruction patients who receive extended
      prophylactic antibiotics with those who do not. In this randomized-controlled trial, women at
      a single institution who undergo implant-based breast reconstruction will be assigned to
      receive either less than 24 hours or 7 days of prophylactic postoperative antibiotics.
      Primary outcome measures will include development of superficial incisional, deep incisional,
      and organ/space surgical site infections at one year as defined by the Centers for Disease
      Control (CDC). Following adjustment for patient age, body mass index, comorbid disease,
      reconstructive timing, disease stage, adjuvant therapy, implant volume, drain use, and other
      procedural variables, relative risk of postoperative infection with use of extended
      prophylactic antibiotics will be estimated. Secondary outcome measures will include
      prosthetic explantation and, in cases of infection, bacteriology and antibiotic
      susceptibilities.
