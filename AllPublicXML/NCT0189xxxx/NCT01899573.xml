      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Subjects with clinically significant mitral regurgitation (MR 2+ and above)

          -  Ejection Fraction ≥ 25%

          -  Stable cardiac medical regimen for heart failure for at least 1 month

          -  Stable NYHA Classification for at least 1 month

          -  Subject is eligible for cardiac surgery

          -  The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions,
             and has provided written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myocardial infarction within 90 days of the intended treatment with the device

          -  Prior surgical, transcatheter, or percutaneous mitral valve intervention

          -  Any intervention for coronary artery disease (CAD) within the last 30 days prior to
             treatment, or unrevascularized multivessel coronary disease

          -  Hemodynamic instability or the need for emergent surgery

          -  Non-ambulatory NYHA Class IV symptoms of heart failure or subjects requiring IV
             inotropic support

          -  Subjects in whom sufficient quality of echocardiography (TTE and TEE) cannot be
             obtained

          -  Echocardiography evidence of primary mitral valve disease causing MR or MS,

          -  Evidence of mitral valve stenosis with an estimated valve area less than 3.0 cm2

          -  Mitral valve prosthesis or pathology that would prevent adequate function of the GDS
             Accucinch System

          -  Estimated GFR of &lt;30ml/min/1.73m2

          -  Greater than mild mitral annular calcification observed by fluoroscopy

          -  Presence of aortic valve prosthesis

          -  Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis or calcification observed by echocardiography
             or fluoroscopy

          -  Severe aortic arch calcification or mobile aortic atheroma observed by
             echocardiography or fluoroscopy

          -  Active bacterial endocarditis

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  History of stroke within the prior 6 months

          -  Subjects in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated

          -  Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased
             risk with the placement of the device.

          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Currently participating in an investigational study

          -  Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g.
             severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic failure, immunological
             abnormalities, and hematological abnormalities)

          -  Subjects with indication for concomitant surgery such as coronary artery bypass graft
             (CABG), aortic valve reconstruction or replacement, tricuspid repair or replacement,
             left ventricular remodeling surgery and congenital repair

          -  Any cardiac resynchronization therapy within the last 3 months prior to treatment

          -  Subjects on high dose steroids or immunosuppressant therapy

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, of child bearing potential or lactating

          -  Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with the follow-up schedule and
             requirements
