  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop a validated French version of the IBDQ in a cohort of
      patients suffering from Inflammatory bowel diseases, namely Crohn's disease and Ulcerative
      Colitis.

      Importance of measuring subjective aspects of the patient's health, often referred to as
      quality of life (QoL), become increasingly recognized and integrated into healthcare. For
      this purpose, The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a widely used
      questionnaire for QoL assessment specific for patients who suffer from inflammatory bowel
      diseases. However, the IBDQ was originally developed in a cohort of Canadian patients in
      English language. Since QoL is impacted by underlying cultural trends, any translation of the
      IBDQ should be reassessed in relation to its validity, reliability, and sensitivity to detect
      change in the new language and cultural context. While the linguistic French translation of
      the original IBDQ has been validated, the French IBDQ has never been tested adequately on a
      French cohort of patient that we aim to perform.
