      To evaluate the influence of virtual reality and vibrational therapy in reducing pain
      intensity secondary to breast cancer before and after application of treatment protocols,
      through biomedical instrumentation.

      After physiotherapy assessment individuals will be randomly divided into three groups: Group
      Virtual Reality - Cinesioterapia (G1), Group Vibration Therapy - Cinesioterapia (G2) and
      Control Group (G3), which will be submitted to the respective treatment protocols. Group
      Virtual Reality Cinesioterapia (G1) participate in this group 20 women will be treated
      through the games Xbox 360 ®, attributed to this, customized applications using virtual and
      augmented reality to be developed. Vibration Therapy Group - Cinesioterapia (G2) - will
      participate in this group 20 women who will undergo 15 minutes of continuous vibration
      through the blanket vibrating members higher, with frequency 40 Hz, 3 function and intensity
      tolerable, keeping the limb supported and elevated to 120 º. At the end held muscle
      stretching exercises, dissociation of shoulder girdle and upper limb exercises assets.
      Control group (G3) - participate in this group 20 women who are treated with conventional
      cinesioterapia through muscle stretching exercises for flexors, extensors, adductors and
      abductors shoulder for 20 seconds each; dissociation girdle; financial assets and Active
      assisted for groups flexors, extensors, abductors and adductors of the upper limbs, which
      will be performed three sets of 10 repetitions for each exercise. Implementation of treatment
      protocols for the groups G1, G2 and G3 will run for two weeks, being Monday through Friday
      feira.totalizando 10 consecutive treatment sessions lasting 30 minutes each session. You will
      be prompted to patients groups G1, G2 and G3 to respond individually and without any aid the
      visual numeric scale of pain, 10 minutes pre-therapy, 15 minutes after the start and 10
      minutes after the end of therapy. Patients will undergo the assessment of pain,
      electromyographic activity of muscles, muscle strength, range of motion analysis and
      perimetry in the first day of treatment, and after completing all the sessions patients were
      reassessed.
