    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study is designed to assess the following: safety and tolerability of
      BIW-8962, Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended Phase 2
      Dose (RP2D) in Phase 1 in subjects with advanced/recurrent lung cancers or mesothelioma and
      preliminary efficacy in Phase 2 in subjects with advanced/recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer.

    <time_frame>First 3-week cycle of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1 -Adverse Event collection and assessment will be done for all potentially treated subjects to assess the safety, tolerability, and determine the DLTs, maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>

    <measure>Phase 2 - To assess the objective response rate(Partial Response and Complete Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until Progressive Disease (PD) determined</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2 - Tumor response and progression will be evaluated every 6 weeks using RECIST v 1.1. Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) will be confirmed 4 weeks after first detection of response.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose, and Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 15 in Cycle 1 and 3, Pre-dose in Cycle 2, 4, 5,and up to Cycle 6</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1 - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as Maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), minimum concentration(Cmin), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (t1/2), clearance (CL), and etc., are assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 3 weeks, until 45days after the last dose or within 7 days prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2 - All safety information will be collected and then evaluated.</description>

    <description>Phase 1 - Dose escalation based on the BIW-8962 tolerability and safety data obtained from three subjects enrolled in a cohort (first cycle of treatment), enrollment at the next dose level or additional subjects into the ongoing cohort will occur

    <description>Phase 1 -With a standard 3+3 dose escalation design, the enrollment in Phase 1 will proceed until the MTD has been defined or the highest dose level has been reached. BIW-8962 will be administered intravenously on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.
Phase 2 - RP2D of BIW-8962 determined in phase 1 portion will be administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.</description>
