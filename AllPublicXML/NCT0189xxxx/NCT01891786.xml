  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the CORDIA study is to use an effective evidence-based
      self-management intervention (SMI) for type 2 diabetes, with and without a novel test to give
      a personalised genetic and lifestyle risk of coronary heart disease, to examine their
      capacity to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and improve diabetes management
      in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes. The effect of these interventions on clinical,
      behavioural and psychological outcomes will be investigated.

    <description>Psycho-social impact of the intervention conditions will be assessed using questionnaires designed to measure risk perception, self-efficacy, and motivation. Feelings of anxiety and depression will also be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of the intervention conditions on health behaviours including diet, exercise and smoking behaviour will be assessed in addition to a range of diabetes self-care behaviours such as foot care and blood glucose self-monitoring.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The participant will provide a saliva sample for analysis. They will attend an appointment with their nurse to receive personalised results on their combined genetic and lifestyle risk for developing CHD in the next 10 years. They will then be asked to attend the 4 week SMI programme.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Self-Management Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The SMI will incorporate a discussion to introduce self-management and why it is important, and about problems associated with reducing CHD risk and managing type 2 diabetes. Specific topics addressed will include health behaviours to reduce CHD risk and manage diabetes including diet and exercise, as well as behaviours specific to managing diabetes, including medication adherence and self-care behaviours (e.g. footcare). Sessions are patient-directed and employ a shared decision-making approach, such that participants work with one another and the practice nurse facilitator to identify specific problems that they wish to address, and to identify solutions and approaches to managing their diabetes and CHD risk</description>
