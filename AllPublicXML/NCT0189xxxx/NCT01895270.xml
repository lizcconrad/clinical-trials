      This application seeks to address the problem of opioid withdrawal by examining the utility
      of the L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) isradipine as an adjunct to BUP detoxification.
      This project will address the need for improved detoxification strategies by assessing the
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of adjunct isradipine during a BUP detoxification in
      opioid-dependent participants. This pilot clinical trial will determine the potential utility
      of the L-type CCB isradipine to improve treatment outcomes in up to 60 opioid-dependent
      individuals undergoing a BUP detoxification procedure. Specifically, this study will
      determine the efficacy of isradipine to reduce withdrawal symptoms, craving, and illicit use
      of opioids in opioid-dependent individuals undergoing BUP detoxification and determine the
      tolerability and safety of controlled-release isradipine (10 mg/day) in opioid-dependent
      individuals undergoing BUP detoxification. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for
      opioid withdrawal are the opioid agonists methadone and BUP, both of which have abuse
      liability. Our findings, if positive, will support a larger phase II clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid dependence continues to be a serious public health problem, particularly with the
      dramatic rise in prescription opioid abuse. Traditional methods of detoxification from
      opioids, including tapering off the opioid agonist methadone or buprenorphine (BUP) and
      supportive treatment of symptomatology with the alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonists, are
      limited by the high relapse rate and/or lack of efficacy in relieving subjective symptoms. In
      addition, transitioning individuals from methadone to BUP maintenance has been limited by the
      need to drastically taper the methadone maintenance dose of methadone-maintained individuals
      prior to switching to BUP maintenance, which can precipitate opiate withdrawal and relapse.
      This application takes a novel approach to address the problem of opioid withdrawal by
      examining the utility of the L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) isradipine as an adjunct to
      BUP detoxification. L-type CCBs have been shown to alleviate opioid withdrawal in
      opioid-treated nonhumans, to be safe and effective in alleviating withdrawal symptoms in
      human detoxification trials, and to have low abuse potential. Moreover, isradipine was the
      most effective of several CCBs tested and was more effective than the alpha2-adrenergic
      agonist clonidine in blocking naloxone-induced behavioral effects without producing
      self-reported effects associated with high potential for abuse. Thus, this project will
      address the need for improved detoxification strategies by assessing the tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of adjunct isradipine during a BUP detoxification in opioid-dependent
      participants. The aim of this 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial is
      to determine the potential utility of the L-type CCB isradipine to improve treatment outcomes
      in up to 60 opioid-dependent individuals undergoing a BUP detoxification procedure. The
      specific aims are to (Aim 1) determine the efficacy of isradipine to reduce withdrawal
      symptoms, craving, and illicit use of opioids in opioid-dependent individuals undergoing BUP
      detoxification and (Aim 2) determine the tolerability and safety of controlled-release
      isradipine (10 mg/day) in opioid-dependent individuals undergoing BUP detoxification.
      Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for opioid withdrawal are the opioid agonists
      methadone and BUP, both of which have abuse liability. Our findings, if positive, will
      support a larger phase II clinical trial. Ultimately, this work could impact the addiction
      field by providing another pharmacological tool that is efficacious for treating opioid
      withdrawal while having minimal abuse liability. This would shift clinical practice,
      establishing an effective adjunct regimen for BUP detoxification as well as having the
      potential to enhance transition to naltrexone therapy.

    <description>Isradipine controlled-release formulation, 10 mg/day maintenance dose, will be administered according to the following dose procedures: Isradipine ingestion will occur under supervision 6 days per week, and a take-home dose will be given on Saturday for participants to take on Sunday. The initial dose of isradipine or placebo will be given on Day 3 of Week 1. The initial dose of isradipine will be 5 mg/day; the dose will increase to 10 mg/day on Day 3 of Week 3 and will continue through Day 2 of Week 7. On Day 3 of Week 7, isradipine will be decreased to 5 mg/day for 7 days. On Days 3-5 of Week 8, all participants will receive placebo. If ISR side effects are too severe at the 10-mg dose, isradipine will be decreased to 5 mg/day. If ISR side effects are too severe at 5 mg/day, isradipine will be discontinued and the participant will be discharged from the study and referred to local treatment agencies.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Availability to attend clinic 6 days a week for approximately 30-60 minutes per day.

          2. Participants must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. These criteria will
             be ascertained in the following manner: the physician will determine whether the
             individual is appropriate based on several clinical assessments that are routinely
             employed by methadone program physicians, including history and severity of opioid
             use, presence of track marks, prior treatment history, self-reported and/or observed
             signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If any individual's degree of opioid
             dependence is questionable, that person will be excluded from further consideration as
             a participant.

          3. Participants must submit a urine sample negative for drugs of abuse other than opioids
             or marijuana prior to starting the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable medical condition or stable medical condition that would interact with study
             medications or participation.

          2. History of major psychiatric disorder (psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar)

          3. Pregnancy or plans to become pregnant or inadequate birth control (adequate birth
             control includes abstinence, condoms, birth control pills, etc).

          4. Present or recent use of over-the-counter psychoactive drug, prescription psychoactive
             drug or any drug that would have major interaction with drugs to be tested.

          5. Liver function tests greater than 3 times normal; BUN and Creatinine outside normal
             range.

          6. EKG abnormalities including but not limited to: bradycardia (&lt;60 bpm); prolonged QTc
             interval (&gt;450 msec); Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome; wide complex tachycardia; 2nd
             degree, Mobitz type II heart block; 3rd degree heart block; left or right bundle
             branch block.

          7. Physical dependence on alcohol or drugs other than opioids, marijuana or tobacco (as
             determined by physician assessment).

          8. Pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing.

          <description>Isradipine controlled-release formulation, 10 mg/day maintenance dose, will be administered according to the following dose procedures: Isradipine ingestion will occur under supervision 6 days per week, and a take-home dose will be given on Saturday for participants to take on Sunday. The initial dose of isradipine or placebo will be given on Day 3 of Week 1. The initial dose of isradipine will be 5 mg/day; the dose will increase to 10 mg/day on Day 3 of Week 3 and will continue through Day 2 of Week 7. On Day 3 of Week 7, isradipine will be decreased to 5 mg/day for 7 days. On Days 3–5 of Week 8, all participants will receive placebo. If ISR side effects are too severe at the 10-mg dose, isradipine will be decreased to 5 mg/day. If ISR side effects are too severe at 5 mg/day, isradipine will be discontinued and the participant will be discharged from the study and referred to local treatment agencies.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Results are limited by the high dropout rate. Because opioid dependent individuals tend to have relatively low pressure, the feasibility of using an immediate-formulation of a calcium channel blocker is unclear.</limitations_and_caveats>
