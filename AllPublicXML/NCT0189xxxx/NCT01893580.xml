  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Improved surgical techniques combined with effective adjuvant chemotherapy, has
      led to a better survival in individuals with NSCLC. The treatment of NSCLC and other cancer
      diseases are after all still complex and potentially lethal.

      Study aim: The rationale for the study PROLUCA is to identify the optimal timing of exercise
      to improve recovery after surgery in patients operated for lunge cancer with focus on
      physical capacity and quality of life.

      Who can participate? Patients above 18 years and diagnosed with lung cancer and referred for
      operation. Participation in this study is not possible if the participants by a doctor are
      advised not to do strenuous exercise.

      What does the study involve? The intervention consists of a combination of (1) exercise
      before surgery and (2) exercise after surgery for lung cancer.

        1. Exercise before surgery is a home-based exercise program is individually designed and
           must be performed for at least 30 minutes every day until surgery. The home-based
           exercise program varies in length due to number of days until surgery, and the intention
           is not exceed 14 days.

        2. The exercise initiated two weeks and 6 weeks after surgery consists of a 12 weeks
           rehabilitation program and three individual counseling sessions. Special needs in terms
           of smoking cessation, nutritional counseling or patient education, this is also offered.
           The exercise consists of individually prepared supervised strength - and fitness
           exercise in a team, two sessions of 60 minutes/week.

      What interventions will be compared? A home-based post-operative exercise program, combined
      with exercise initiated two weeks after surgery, will be compared with usual care (exercise
      initiated six weeks after surgery).

      Will all participants receive the same treatment?

      By draw it is decided which of the 4 groups the participants will attend to in the study:

        -  Group 1: Home-based exercise before surgery and rehabilitation initiated as early as two
           weeks after surgery

        -  Group 2: Home-based exercise before surgery and rehabilitation initiated six weeks after
           surgery

        -  Group 3: Rehabilitation initiated as early as two weeks after surgery

        -  Group 4: Rehabilitation initiated six weeks after surgery (Usual practice as control
           group) What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? There are no risks or
           side- effects of participating other than muscle soreness and exercise is beneficial
           when it comes to recover from an operation from lung cancer.

    <measure>Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2peak)</measure>
    <time_frame>VO2peak is assessed at baseline, the day before surgery, post-intervention (14/18 weeks after surgery), six months after surgery, and one year after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>VO2peak is evaluated by an incremental test using an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Lode Corival Ergometer©). Inspired and expired gases are analyzed breath-by-breath by a metabolic cart (JAEGER MasterScreen CPX©). Subjects begin pedaling at seven watts and resistance increases after a predefined 10 watts ramp protocol until exhaustion or a symptom-limited VO2peak is achieved (pain, dizziness, anxiety etc.).</description>
