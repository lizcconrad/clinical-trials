      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of alkali administration on bicarbonate
      and potassium levels in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and depressed serum
      bicarbonate levels. The study is a prospective non-blinded evaluation of tolerability and
      efficacy of alkali repletion with 4 weeks of observation and two sequential 4 week courses of
      escalating oral sodium bicarbonate treatment.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effect of alkali administration on bicarbonate and potassium levels in patients
      with SCD and depressed serum bicarbonate levels.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the effect of alkali administration on improvement in hemolysis and on sequelae of
      impaired kidney function, ie, LDH, Hgb, reticulocyte count, red cell half-life, and muscle
      strength, Vitamin D levels, and markers of bone turnover, respectively.

      To assess the influence of alkali administrations on markers of kidney tubule inflammation.

      To evaluate intraparenchymal iron in patients with SCD and renal dysfunction. Safety and
      adverse events of alkali patients with sickle cell disease will be monitored. This research
      will supplement current knowledge about management of the clinically important subset of
      people with SCD who have renal insufficiency and acid-base perturbation.

    <description>Oral sodium bicarbonate tablets administered at a starting dose of 0.6 mEQ/Kg body weight and will be escalated once, at 4 weeks, to 0.9 mEQ/Kg body weight.
Weekly schedule:
0-4 weeks: Serial Measurement at baseline, without therapy 4-8 weeks: *~0.6 mEq/kg of ideal body weight of Sodium Bicarbonate tablets divided into TID dosing 8-12 weeks: *~0.9 mEq/kg of ideal body weight of Sodium Bicarbonate tablets divided into TID dosing
* to the closest dose of 650 mg (7.74 mEq)
Ideal Body Weight is defined by the following formulas (Devine Calculation):
Ideal Body Weight (men) = 50 + 2.3 (Height (in) - 60) Ideal Body Weight (women) = 45.5 + 2.3 ( Height (in) - 60)</description>
