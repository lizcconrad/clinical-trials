      The proposed study seeks to test the efficacy of an intervention to reduce suicide behaviors
      in Veterans. The Veterans Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP-VA) is an
      innovative, telephone-based intervention that combines elements of individual therapy, case
      management, and significant other/family therapy and is designed to be integrated into a VA
      system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a leading cause of death for military personnel, and for the first time in
      recorded history, rates of military suicides are exceeding civilian rates. Despite public and
      patient health costs associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, existing efforts haven't
      appreciably reduced rates of suicidal behavior in the military. Consequently, finding novel,
      efficacious, and acceptable methods to reduce suicide behaviors is imperative. The Veteran's
      Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP-VA) is a unique suicide reduction
      intervention that directly targets high-risk patients at the time of hospital discharge. It
      is one of the few empirically-developed and promising interventions (e.g., strong pilot data)
      for individuals hospitalized for suicide behavior.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of the CLASP intervention
      compared to a treatment as usual plus Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (SAFE)
      control condition. Efficacy will be determined by primary outcomes including: number of
      attempts, number of re-hospitalizations, severity, and chronicity of suicidal ideation. A
      secondary objective is identifying the types of patients who receive the most benefit from
      the CLASP-VA intervention.
