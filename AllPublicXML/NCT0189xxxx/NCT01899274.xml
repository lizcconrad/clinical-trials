  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether an electronic self-management tool,
      specifically an iPhone application entitled bant, can improve glycemic control in Adolescents
      who have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children,
      adolescents and adults. While intensive patient self-management can optimize Blood Glucose
      (BG) to near-normal levels, it is a challenge for many TIDM patients to continuously achieve
      this. These difficulties are compounded in the adolescent population, who struggle with daily
      self-management and therefore may increase their risk of T1DM complications.

      Due to this observation an electronic self-management tool, in the form of an iPhone
      application called bant, was developed. This app guides the analysis of BG data and suggests
      changes in treatment, while also using social network and rewards to encourage and reinforce
      self-care behaviors, such as frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels (SMBG). By
      primarily measuring changes in HbA1C levels, the study will assess if bant and its features
      are associated with improved glycemic control in the adolescents who use it.

    <measure>Changes in Hemoglobin A1C levels</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month RCT duration</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1C levels are a common and important measure of diabetes control, and will be collected at baseline, regular 3-month research follow-ups, a final 12-month research visit. Primary Outcome will be based on comparison of A1C values at baseline to A1C values at RCT completion (12 months).
In order to assess the potential durability of the intervention, A1C values will also be recorded (from clinical visits) 6-months and 12-months post-RCT completion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month RCT duration</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemic events will be measured at baseline, and every following 3 months (for 1 year). These will include both severe hypoglycemic events (requiring assistance of another individual with a BG &lt;2.8 mmol/l and/or reversal of symptoms with oral or intravenous carbohydrate/glucose) and mild hypoglycemic events (BG &lt;3.4mmol/L).</description>
