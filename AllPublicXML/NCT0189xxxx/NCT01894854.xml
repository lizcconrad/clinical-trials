  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to further investigate the clinical and radiological importance of
      design changes in cementless hip prosthesis. The investigators have earlier evaluated the
      classical Furlong HAC total hip prosthesis and a first design change Furlong Active. Now a
      further development, Furlong Evolution, is to be evaluated. This prosthesis, furthermore,
      comes with and without a collar, and the investigators are going to randomize between the
      two. The investigators hypothesize that the new design will be easier to implant and will
      present equal or less migration than the older designs which would imply a favourable outcome
      in the long term. The investigators further hypothesize that the collar play no major part
      for the long term migration and bone remodelling.

    <time_frame>14 days postoperatively and after 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This will measure the change in bone density around the prosthesis during the first important year. This will tell if there is a bone resorption around the stem or cup.</description>
