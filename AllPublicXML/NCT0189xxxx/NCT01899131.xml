      1. To investigate the hard and soft tissue adaptation and maintenance to the Laser-Lok®
           microchannels permanent abutment/ new Laser-Lok® implant assembly by performing clinical
           and radiographic evaluations.

        2. To investigate the effect of inter-implant spacing (minimum of 2 or 3 mm) on hard and
           soft tissues.

        3. To perform clinical and radiographic evaluations on these abutment/implant assemblies up
           to 2 years.
