      The purpose of this study is to first determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine
      given alone or in combination with valproic acid during preoperative short-course
      radiotherapy (Phase 1). The next part of the study (Phase 2)will explore whether the addition
      of valproic acid or the addition of capecitabine to short-course radiotherapy, before optimal
      radical surgery might increase the pathologic complete tumor regression rate in patients with
      low-moderate risk rectal cancer.
