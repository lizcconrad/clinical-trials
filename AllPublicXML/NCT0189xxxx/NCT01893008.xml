  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREPARE study is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      hypothesis that preoperative inspiratory muscle training leads to decreased pulmonary
      complications in patients undergoing esophageal resection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Esophageal resection is associated with high incidences of postoperative pulmonary
      pneumonia. Numbers of 30% are reported in literature. Postoperative complications can result
      in prolonged hospital stay and increased health care costs. In cardiac surgery patients a
      reduction of postoperative pneumonia of 50% is reported as a result of a preoperative
      inspiratory muscle training program. While in some surgical centers IMT is already used in
      the preoperative phase in patients undergoing esophageal resection, the effect of this
      promising intervention has not yet been investigated in a randomised and controlled study
      design in large surgical populations other than cardiac surgery.

      Primary objective: Investigate the effect of a preoperative inspiratory muscle training
      program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal
      resection.

      Study design: Prospective multicenter randomised controlled clinical trial.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: A significant reduction in incidence of postoperative
      pneumonia.

    <description>The IMT protocol is tailored individually. Inspiratory load is set at 60% of the measured maximal inspiratory pressure (Pimax). The load is incrementally increased based on the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) scored on a scale from 0 to 10 which is scored by the patient after each training session. When patients score an RPE below 7, patients increase the inspiratory load of the threshold device with 5% to guarantee overload during each training session. Patients have to complete 30 dynamic inspiratory efforts twice daily.
Patients will be instructed to train at home 7 days a week until surgery with a minimum of 2 weeks.
Training will be started after the chemoradiation period (if applicable).</description>
