      A continuous peripheral nerve block—also termed &quot;perineural local anesthetic
      infusion&quot;—involves the insertion of a tiny tube (a &quot;catheter&quot;) through the skin and adjacent
      to a peripheral nerve, followed by local anesthetic (numbing medicine) administration via the
      catheter, providing pain control following surgery. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be
      provided in the hospital setting, but the use of lightweight, portable pumps permits infusion
      at home as well. However, it remains unknown if the concentration of the local anesthetic
      influences the block effects; or, is it rather simply the total dose of medication that is
      important. If it is the latter, then the concentration of local anesthetic could be
      increased, allowing a decreased basal infusion rate, which would allow patients at home to
      receive twice the duration of potent pain control since their infusion pump local anesthetic
      reservoir would last twice as long as current practice. In addition, if one
      concentration/dose combination results in less muscle weakness, but with at least equivalent
      analgesia, then the risk of falling might be decreased as well.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that providing ropivacaine at different
      concentrations and rates (0.1% at 8 mL/hour vs. 0.4% at 2 mL/hour)—but at an equivalent total
      basal (8 mg/hour)—produces comparable effects when used in a continuous popliteal-sciatic
      nerve block.

      A continuous peripheral nerve block—also termed &quot;perineural local anesthetic
      infusion&quot;—involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter adjacent to a peripheral nerve,
      followed by local anesthetic administration via the catheter, providing anesthesia/analgesia.
      Continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be provided in the hospital setting, but the use of
      lightweight, portable pumps permits ambulatory infusion as well. This technique's most-common
      application is providing analgesia following surgical procedures, and it has enjoyed
      explosive growth in the past decade due multiple factors, including the simplicity of
      ultrasound-guided catheter insertion, the ability to provide analgesia with concurrent
      administration of various anticoagulants (unlike epidural infusions), and a relative lack of
      complications associated with the technique. Importantly, ambulatory infusion has experienced
      logarithmic increases in growth due to the fact that oral analgesics often provide
      insufficient analgesia following painful outpatient surgical procedures.

      The optimal local anesthetic (predominantly ropivacaine in the United States) concentration
      remains unknown, but the overwhelming percentage of investigators use 0.2% (&gt;98% of reports).
      It is at this concentration that the basal infusion rate of 4-8 mL/h has been reported.
      However, recent evidence suggests that for continuous femoral nerve blocks, it is the local
      anesthetic dose that determines infusion effects, and not concentration. This raises the
      tantalizing possibility that a basal infusion at half the standard rate with ropivacaine of
      twice the standard concentration results in equivalent analgesia, since the total dose
      remains unchanged (rate [volume] x concentration determines total dose).

      The study suggesting that it is dose, and not rate/concentration, that determines perineural
      effects involved femoral catheters. However, femoral infusions are rarely provided to
      outpatients due to their inducing thigh muscle weakness and a resulting high risk of falls.
      In contrast, the other perineural catheter locations such as popliteal-sciatic are often
      provided to outpatients because there is less fall risk (patients often avoid &quot;walking&quot; on
      their operative foot with the use of crutches). If this relationship holds true for other
      catheter locations, it would mean that adequate postoperative analgesia could be provided
      with a fraction of the basal infusion rate—and, therefore, a fraction of the local anesthetic
      volume. In addition, if one concentration/dose combination results in less muscle weakness,
      but with at least equivalent analgesia, then the risk of falling might be decreased as well
      for those patients who DO ambulate postoperatively on their operative foot.

      The result: portable infusion pumps' local anesthetic reservoir volume be consumed at a lower
      rate, greatly increasing the duration of post-operative analgesia provided by ambulatory
      perineural infusion; and, the risk of postoperative falls might be decreased.

      In fact, there is currently evidence that a low-rate, high-concentration continuous
      ropivacaine popliteal-sciatic block decreases the incidence of an unwanted insensate
      extremity compared with a high-rate, low-concentration infusion. However, this study in
      outpatients was not powered to determine analgesia equivalence, and was criticized for
      relying on subjective endpoints. More importantly, subjects self-administered bolus doses,
      making it impossible to determine the total dose that each actually received and confounding
      the results.

      The investigators therefore propose a volunteer-based clinical trial testing the hypothesis
      that providing ropivacaine at different concentrations and rates (0.1% at 8 mL/hour vs. 0.4%
      at 2 mL/hour)—but at an equivalent total basal dose (8 mg/hour)—produces comparable effects
      when infused for a continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block. The primary endpoint will be
      tolerance to cutaneous electrical current applied on the plantar aspect of the foot. This is
      an objective endpoint that has been validated in multiple previous publications and
      correlates with intra- and post-operative pain.

      Ethics of Inclusion of Volunteers: Currently, there are no data investigating this hypothesis
      for popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks. The study cannot be done without the volunteer model that
      we describe for the following reason. Of note, the study itself is investigating the
      principle of whether or not the local anesthetic concentration/rate/dose within continuous
      popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks affects both the sensory and motor effects. To test our
      hypothesis does not require including patients with post-surgical acute pain. We need to
      determine whether or not—and to what extent—these local anesthetic factors have any an affect
      on sensory and motor block. An acute pain model is not necessary in this case. We are not
      trying to ascertain which concentrations/rates/doses of local anesthetic optimize
      postoperative analgesia—which would require an acute pain model. Rather, we are trying to
      determine if these factors have any affects on the resulting sensory and/or motor blockade.
      This is a theoretical question of immense importance that both can be answered involving
      healthy volunteers; and, cannot be answered using an acute pain model (explanation below).

      In post-surgical patients, the surgical pain must be treated—it is unconscionable (and
      unethical) to NOT treat this pain. Previous clinical studies (all unpublished failures—the
      P.I. knows of from discussing with colleagues) attempting to answer the same questions the
      proposed volunteer study will answer have all failed for this reason: when a surgical patient
      has pain, an analgesic MUST be provided. This confounds the collected data. For example, if a
      perineural infusion is provided as a basal dose at 4 mL/h, and the patient has surgical
      breakthrough pain, then a bolus of local anesthetic must be administered to provide
      analgesia. Given that we are trying to determine the relative effects of concentration and
      dose upon block effects, the extra bolus doses on top of the basal infusion confound the
      results: if a patient has lower pain scores, is that because of the intervention or because
      s/he treated any discomfort with additional bolus doses of local anesthetic and therefore a
      higher total dose of local anesthetic when combined with the basal infusion? In the proposed
      volunteer model there will be no surgical pain, and therefore the treatment groups receiving
      only a basal infusion will not require bolus doses. Only in this way will we be able to
      discern the relative effects of concentration and dose.

      This is a critical question to answer given that providing a continuous popliteal-sciatic
      nerve block results in some degree of muscle weakness (as well as femoral nerve sensory
      deficit which provides the post-surgical analgesia); and muscle weakness increases the risk
      of falls;5 and falls may result in catastrophic post-operative complications. The problem is
      that many foot/ankle procedures—such as bunionectomy—are very painful and require potent
      postoperative analgesia—and only a continuous femoral nerve block will provide this potent
      analgesia (on top of oral and intravenous analgesics such as COX-2 inhibitors and opioids).
      Insurance companies will not pay for in-hospital stays for nearly all foot/ankle procedures,
      and therefore patient have no choice but to return home with either insufficient analgesia
      with oral analgesics; or, they receive a perineural popliteal-sciatic nerve block using a
      portable infusion pump. Unfortunately, at the relatively high rate that is currently used to
      deliver the local anesthetic, the infusion pump reservoirs do not outlast the
      moderate-to-severe surgical pain. So, we must find a way to extend the analgesia of
      continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks while minimizing the resulting motor block.
      Answering this vital question will help healthcare providers administer continuous
      popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks (as well as catheters in other anatomic locations) in a safer
      manner, yet still optimize postoperative analgesia.

      Only with a volunteer study can these critical questions be answered; and the answers are
      critically important to maximize the care that literally hundreds-of-thousands of patients
      are receiving annually in the United States, and millions across the World (continuous
      peripheral nerve blocks are used in Europe and Australia even more than in the United States
      because of earlier adoption of the technique in the 1990s).

      This investigation will be a randomized, observer-masked, controlled, split-body,
      human-subjects clinical trial.

      Enrollment. Subjects will be volunteers of both sexes, age 18 and older. Volunteers will be
      solicited using newspaper advertisements, fliers, and an existing database of volunteers (IRB
      approved). If a volunteer meets inclusion/exclusion criteria and desires study participation,
      written, informed consent will be obtained. Selection for inclusion will not be based on race
      or socioeconomic status. The study population of interest includes men and women of all races
      and socioeconomic status. A urine pregnancy test will be administered to all women of
      childbearing age following written informed consent but before any study interventions. This
      urine test will be administered by CTRI nursing staff using standard, FDA-approved urine
      pregnancy testing devices.

      Inclusion criteria for the trial will be: (1) age ≥ 18 years; and (2) willing to have
      bilateral femoral perineural catheters placed with a subsequent ropivacaine infusion and
      motor/sensory testing for 6 hours, requiring an overnight stay in the UCSD GCRC/CTRI to allow
      dissipation of local anesthetic infusion effects by the following morning. Exclusion criteria
      for the trial will be: (1) current daily analgesic use; (2) opioid use within the previous 4
      weeks; (3) any neuro-muscular deficit of either femoral nerves and/or quadriceps muscles; (4)
      morbid obesity [weight &gt; 35 kg/m2]; (5) pregnancy (as determined by a urine pregnancy test
      prior to any study interventions); and (6) incarceration. We expect to recruit a maximum of
      30 healthy volunteers; with a target goal of 24 for the analysis. Selection for inclusion
      will not be based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status. The study population of interest
      includes men and women of all races and socioeconomic status. There will be no participants
      from vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, children, or prisoners

      Perineural catheter insertion. Following written, informed consent, subjects will be admitted
      to the UCSD CTRI and have demographic/morphometric data recorded (e.g., age, weight, height).
      An intravenous line will be placed in an upper extremity, followed by external monitors
      (pulse oxymeter, blood pressure, and EKG), and oxygen by nasal cannula. Sedation will be
      provided with intravenous fentanyl (50 mcg) and/or midazolam (1 mg), or oral valium (10 mg)
      and/or dilaudid (4 mg), as necessary. Subjects will then have bilateral popliteal-sciatic
      perineural catheters placed using standard UC San Diego techniques as previously published by
      the current P.I.7,8

      Treatment Group Assignment. Subjects will have the right-sided catheter randomly assigned to
      one of two treatment groups: a ropivacaine concentration of 0.1% or 0.4%. Subjects will act
      as their own controls, with the contralateral side receiving the alternative concentration.
      The Investigational Drug Service will prepare the randomization list as well as the two
      ropivacaine reservoirs and two electronic infusion pumps (SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System,
      Baxter Healthcare International, Deerfield, IL) used to infuse the ropivacaine. All pumps
      will be FDA approved for infusion of local anesthetic. The basal rate of each infusion will
      be determined by the ropivacaine concentration in each pump reservoir: 0.1% (8 mL/h) or 0.4%
      (2 mL/h). While the basal rate and bolus volume will differ for each concentration, the total
      dose of local anesthetic will be the same for both treatments (8 mg/h). The local anesthetic
      reservoirs will be contained within an opaque bag prepared by the Investigational Drug
      Service, and the infusion rates displayed on the pumps covered, ensuring masking for both the
      subjects and observers (clinical research nurse taking the measurements). Following 6 hours
      (48 mg), the infusions will be discontinued and the catheters removed.

      Treatment Group Basal Rate (mL/h) Basal Dose (mg/h) Total Dose (mg in 6 h) Ropivacaine 0.1% 8
      8 48 Ropivacaine 0.4% 2 8 48

      The tubing from the pumps to the subjects will be gently wound at least 5 rotations and
      covered with opaque tape, masking which perineural catheter is receiving which treatment
      (ropivacaine is clear, so the flow through the clear tubing from the tape to the perineural
      catheters will not be visually distinguishable). Subjects will remain within the CTRI until
      the following morning at least until Hour 22 for the final measurement; or, until their
      perineural infusion sensory and motor effects have resolved. If a subject requests early
      withdrawal from the study, they will remain in the CTRI until their perineural infusion
      sensory and motor effects have resolved.

      Outcome Measurements. The selected measures have established reliability and validity and
      minimal inter-rater discordance. Measurements will be performed at Hour 0 (baseline), and on
      the hour until Hour 14, as well as the following morning at Hour 22. In all cases,
      measurements will be taken in the supine position with the dominant side measured first,
      followed by the non-dominant side.

      Tolerance of transcutaneous electrical stimulation: Sensory perception—depth of
      analgesia—will be evaluated using tolerance of transcutaneous electrical stimulation with the
      same quantitative procedure validated and used in multiple clinical trials. Electrocardiogram
      pads are placed on the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of the foot which is covered by
      the sciatic nerve distribution; and, the tolerance to cutaneous electrical current is
      obtained using a nerve stimulator. The current is increased from 0 mA until subjects detect
      the electrical current (up to a maximum of 80 mA), at which time the current is recorded and
      the nerve stimulator turned off.

      Muscle strength: We will evaluate muscle strength with an isometric force electromechanical
      dynamometer to measure the force produced during a maximum voluntary isometric
      plantar-flexion (muscles innervated by the sciatic nerve). The dynamometer will be placed
      against the bed's foot board (immobile) and the subject will be asked to take 2 seconds to
      come to maximum effort contracting the target muscles, maintain this effort for 5 seconds,
      and then relax. The measurements immediately prior to perineural ropivacaine administration
      will be designated as baseline measurements, and all subsequent measurements will be
      expressed as a percentage of the pre-infusion baseline.

      Food and Drink: Both food and accompanying beverages/water will be provided by the hospital
      and served by the nursing staff immediately following catheter insertion. Meals will be
      provided without charge to the study subjects. There is no restriction on oral intake
      following catheter insertion.

      Statistical Analysis. Sample size calculations are based on the primary aim of determining
      the relationship between perineural ropivacaine concentration and continuous
      popliteal-sciatic nerve block effects. To this end, we will perform an equivalency trial with
      the primary endpoint designated as the maximum tolerance to transcutaneous electrical
      stimulation at Hour 6. We will aim to demonstrate that differing the concentration (0.1% vs.
      0.4%) applied to different legs of each subject, but providing an equal total dose (8 mg/h)
      of ropivacaine through a popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter does not result in a
      significant difference in tolerance between legs at Hour 6. We will conclude that the
      interventions are equivalent if the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in
      tolerance between legs is contained within the pre-specified tolerance interval of +/- 10 mA.
      This value is used as the minimally clinically-relevant current since it approximates the
      tolerated electrical current range at baseline of the general population—in other words,
      natural variability and therefore a relatively small amount of current to detect.4 Based on
      previously-published data,1,4 we assume the standard deviation of tolerance difference
      between legs is SD=13 mA. With n=24 subjects, we will correctly conclude equivalence with
      approximately 80% probability (&quot;power&quot;). Alternatively, if the population difference is 10
      mA, we will correctly reject equivalence with probability 5%. The mean difference between
      treatments will be estimated by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), using baseline tolerance
      difference as a covariate. Subjects will receive each of the two treatments applied randomly
      to the left and right legs.

      The same analyses will be applied to the secondary endpoints. Profiles of the responses over
      time will be examined with spaghetti and mean plots. Further secondary analyses will include
      mixed-effects modeling of the repeated measures. These models account for the hierarchical
      correlation of paired measures from each subject over time, and will be used to test the
      effects of subject characteristics, including sex, height, weight, body mass index, and age.
      The model will also allow simultaneous analysis of all observations while accounting for
      within-subject correlation, which can improve the standard errors of the estimated
      differential at each time point. The within-subject correlation will be modeled via a
      subject-specific random intercept. This is similar to a compound symmetric correlation
      structure without a random effect. The change from baseline, Y, for subject i and time t will
      be modeled with the linear mixed-effect model:

      Yi(t¬j) = Yi(0) β0 + 1{t¬j=1}β1 + … + 1{t¬j=9}β9 + bi + eij

      where 1{t¬j=k} is 1 if t¬j=k and 0 otherwise. The subject-specific random intercepts bi and
      residuals eij are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. We will present the estimated
      difference at each hour with unadjusted p-values, and p-values adjusted using the single-step
      method for simultaneous inference from parametric models.

      Analyses will be executed using R version 2.12 (http://www.r-project.org). Additional
      analyses will include the Mann-Whitney U for nonparametric comparisons and Fisher's exact
      test for categorical variables (InStat, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, United
      States).
