  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is designed to examine the effectiveness of strategies to increase access to
      treatment for tobacco use and dependence among rural Veteran smokers. In addition, it will
      examine whether tailored treatment that is designed to address common comorbid conditions
      that are related to cigarette smoking enhances success with quitting relative to enhanced
      standard of care. The investigators hypothesize that participants assigned to the tailored
      tobacco cessation intervention will report greater cessation rates at six months. The
      investigators also anticipate more favorable outcomes on measures of depressive symptoms,
      alcohol use, and body weight.
