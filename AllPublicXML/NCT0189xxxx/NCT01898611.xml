  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome leading to physical deterioration including muscle wasting
      (sarcopenia) and unintentional weight loss. There are currently no approved therapies for
      frailty. Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite centers in the
      brain. The investigators already know that a single dose of Ghrelin improves food intake
      immediately after the dose in frail older people. In addition, exercise programs have been
      shown to improve strength and function in older people. In this study, the investigators are
      trying to find out if a joint intervention of ghrelin and resistance training will improve
      walking, balance and leg strength in frail elderly people.

    <description>The SPPB includes three components: gait speed on a 15-foot walk, standing balance testing, and time to rise from a chair 5 times. Each test is rated on a five-level categorical score, with 0 representing inability to complete the test and 4 representing the highest level of performance, and summed to create a score ranging from 0 to 12.</description>
