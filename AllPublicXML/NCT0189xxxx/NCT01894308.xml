    <textblock>
      This study is a continuation of previous studies done in healthy volunteers to prove the
      efficacy of delivering Testosterone, the male hormone, rapidly across intact skin in s series
      of doses from low to high in men with low-to-no natural testosterone production to measure
      their response to the varying doses. The results of this study will inform further studies
      which will be longer in length, as to the starting doses. The study will be conducted in
      London, U.K. at the Advanced Therapies Centre, The London Clinic.

      48 Patients will be enrolled following 2 independent verifying blood tests of their diagnosis
      of Hypogonadism. there will be 4 cohorts of 12 subjects, each receiving doses of the trail
      materials, titrated by means of number of sprays applied. Doses will range from 10 to 70 mgs
      Testosterone.
