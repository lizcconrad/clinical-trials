  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is a routine procedure in pregnant
      women. The assessment of Hb involves several steps, including a needle stick, blood
      collection, blood sample analysis in the laboratory, and waiting for the results.

      Pronto-7 (manufactured by Masimo, CA, USA) is a new portable device that allows a quick
      bedside Hb spot check. A finger clip probe, similar to the standard oxygen finger clip probe,
      provides hemoglobin values in less than 60 seconds.

      In this prospective observational study the investigators will assess the clinical accuracy
      of Pronto-7 derived Hb values compared to the gold standard laboratory Hb values in obstetric
      patients. We will be calculating the mean difference between Pronto-7 and laboratory Hb
      values. We plan to recruit 55 pregnant women admitted for vaginal or cesarean delivery at BC
      Women's Hospital.

      Serum hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is one of the most common laboratory tests measured when
      a pregnant woman (parturient) is admitted for a vaginal or cesarean delivery. The Hb
      concentration is normally measured from a venous blood sample in clinical laboratories using
      co-oximetry.

      A new point-of-care pulse co-oximeter, the Pronto-7 (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA), is
      a portable device that offers a non-invasive and quick spot-checking of Hb (SpHb).
      Measurement with the Pronto-7 takes about 60 seconds and does not require the transfer of
      blood samples to a laboratory. In addition to SpHb, the device provides a perfusion index
      (PI) value (a numeric estimation of the pulse strength at the measurement site), heart rate,
      oxygen saturation, and finger temperature. Potential advantages of the Pronto-7 include
      reduced staff work, decreased exposure to potential biohazards, and reduced pain and
      discomfort to the patient.

      A similar technology is used in Radical-7 pulse co-oximeter (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA,
      USA) for non-invasive Hb measurement. Radical-7 has been evaluated in human volunteers
      undergoing hemodilution, in patients undergoing spine surgeries, major urological procedures,
      and in critically ill patients. However, the results regarding the accuracy of this
      technology are conflicting.
