  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our central hypothesis is that dietary limitations introduced by food allergy will contribute
      to increased food insecurity in households with food allergic children when compared to food
      insecure households without food allergic children.

      Specific Aim 1 To describe food insecurity in families of the pediatric allergy population,
      specifically comparing the prevalence of food insecurity rates between households of food
      allergic patients and households of allergic patients without food allergy.

      Specific Aim 2 To examine health literacy in parents of patients in the pediatric allergy
      population, comparing food insecure patients with and without food allergy to food secure
      patients with food allergy.

      Specific Aim 3 To examine quality of life in food allergic patients' households using the
      food allergy impact scale, comparing food allergic patients' households with food insecurity
      to food allergic patients' households without food insecurity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of food insecurity within an atopic population</measure>
    <time_frame>1.25 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable of interest is the presence of food insecurity (patients with Low Food Security or Very Low Food Security). A chi-square test of independence will be used to test the association between food insecurity and food allergy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Literacy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1.25 years</time_frame>
    <description>A logistic regression analysis will be done to test the effect of food allergy and food insecurity on the health illiteracy rates after adjusting for confounding variables such as demographics. Appropriate contrasts for the interaction effect between food allergy and food insecurity will also be used to compare health literacy rates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life of families with food allergic members</measure>
    <time_frame>1.25 years</time_frame>
    <description>The average quality of life score taken across all six items in the quality of life questionnaire will be the outcome variable of interest. The mean average quality of life score between the food secure households with food allergy and the food insecure households with food allergy will be compared between the two groups using an ANCOVA method.</description>

        Families with children who have allergy appointments at Arkansas Children's Hospital
        between 1-17 years of age. We will recruit 325 families with patients in the food allergy
        group and 325 families with patients in the without food allergy group.
