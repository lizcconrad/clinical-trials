    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the value of dual time point PET/CT in lymphoma. Since FDG
      uptake is linked to glucose metabolism, PET imaging is also used to detect suspected sites
      for infectious and inflammatory disorders. In a clinical setting, it is a challenge to
      distinguish between FDG uptake in benign and malignant lesions and this gives rise to a
      considerable quantity of false positive results and decreased positive predictive values.
      Performing FDG-PET imaging sixty minutes after injection is common practice in the staging
      and surveillance of lymphoma but this procedure may not be optimal, especially not in
      settings where benign inflammatory lesions are of clinical concern.

      In an attempt to find an alternative method for this discrimination, dual time point FDG-PET
      was introduced. This technique has shown itself to be a potentially promising method in
      FDG-PET imaging for distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions using SUV values. The
      reason for the different FDG uptake patterns between inflammatory and malignant lesions is
      unclear. Several factors may contribute to this phenomenon on a cellular basis. It has been
      shown that cancer cells exhibit increased numbers of glucose transporter and low level of
      glucose-6-phosphatase. Varying levels between different cancer cell types may explain the
      different FDG uptake curves. Because various cell types exhibit varying rates of FDG uptake
      we believe that kinetic investigation may prove to be of value in understanding different
      types of lymphoma and identifying how to perform precise imaging for staging and
      surveillance.
