    <textblock>
      Early and effective control of severe bleeding is critical to survival of trauma patients.
      The iTClampâ„¢50 is a Health Canada approved medical device for temporary wound/skin closure
      that quickly controls bleeding by sealing the skin. Similar to a clip, the device seals the
      skin edges within a pressure bar, enabling the creation of a hematoma where blood collects
      under pressure to form a stable clot until definitive repair. The iTClamp50 is indicated for
      use as a skin closure device for short-term soft tissue approximation, including use in
      trauma wounds, lacerations, junctional bleeds or surgical incisions. The purpose of this
      prospective clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the iTClamp50 in
      the ambulance (pre-hospital) and emergency department setting. This will be accomplished by
      observing patients with the device applied from the pre-hospital through to patient
      discharge. The hypothesis is that the iTClamp50 will be safe and effective at providing
      temporary wound closure to control hemorrhage in the pre-hospital and emergency department
      setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The device is indicated for use to control external hemorrhage from all compressible
             areas and to close wounds on the torso (chest and abdomen). The final decision to
             apply the device will be left with the care provider; however, their rationale will be
             reviewed in the post-use questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The device is contraindicated for application to specific regions (e.g., eyes and
             genitals), application on patients less than the size of maturity, and wounds in which
             the skin edges cannot be approximated.
