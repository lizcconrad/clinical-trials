  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disease, associated with cardiovascular disease,
      cerebrovascular disease, and many other medical conditions. Therefore the precise diagnosis
      and treatment are important. With drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), the three-dimensional
      evaluation of upper airway and airway obstruction could be possible. The problem of the DISE
      is that there is the difference between a sedative-induced sleep and normal sleep. Moreover
      there were no standard sedation protocol of DISE. Propofol has short half-life, about 3
      minutes, so the patients could recover quickly from it. In recent years, using target
      controlled infusion(TCI) of propofol, the effective effect-site concentration for DISE could
      be reached easily with hemodynamic stability and minimal toxic effect. In a previous pilot
      study, the endoscopy for the diagnosis of sleep apnea could be done successfully with
      propofol TCI. However there were some desaturation events, although the EEG showed that the
      patient was not in deep sleep enough. Therefore we thought that not only further study of
      propofol for DISE but also the study of other drugs for DISE will be needed to overcome this
      limitation. Dexmedetomidine, the selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has analgesic effect
      and almost no respiratory depression, therefore it could be a good alternative drug for DISE.
      The purpose of this study is designing the appropriate sedation protocol for DISE using
      propofol or dexmedetomidine, and enabling the safer and more accurate DISE.
