    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, single-dose study of belimumab in
      healthy subjects to estimate the relative bioavailability, tolerability and safety of a
      single dose of belimumab 200 milligram (mg) when self-administered SC by healthy subjects
      using a prefilled syringe or autoinjector. This study will also assess the usability and
      reliability of the injection devices. A total of approximately 80 subjects (40 per group)
      will be randomly assigned in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive 200 mg belimumab SC as a single 1.0
      milliliter (mL) injection of the liquid formulation (200 mg/mL) on Day 0 via the assigned
      injection device. Subjects will continue to be followed for 70 days after the administration
      of belimumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied, may be included only if the
             Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor agree and document that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures.

          -  Negative urine drug screen; A negative urine drug screen for ethanol, opioids,
             barbiturates, cocaine, and amphetamines is required during screening

          -  Body weight &gt;=45 kilograms (kg) to 120 kg (inclusive) at Screening

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             (for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records); or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
             &gt;40 milli international units/milliliter (MlU/ml) and estradiol &lt;40
             picogram/milliliter (pg/ml) (&lt;147 picomol/liter [pmol/L]) is confirmatory). Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 4
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method; Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum or
             urine human chorionic gonadotropins (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing and
             Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for 2 weeks prior to the day of dosing
             to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must
             agree to use contraception until Day 112, or; OR has only same-sex partners, when this
             is her preferred and usual lifestyle.
