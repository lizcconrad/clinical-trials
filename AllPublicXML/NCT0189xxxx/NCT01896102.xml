    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the efficacy and safety of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells,
      transduced ex-vivo with Lenti-D lentiviral vector, for the treatment of cerebral
      adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). A subject's blood stem cells will be collected and modified
      (transduced) using the Lenti-D lentiviral vector encoding human adrenoleukodystrophy protein.
      After modification (transduction) with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector, the cells will be
      transplanted back into the subject following myeloablative conditioning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent is obtained from a competent custodial parent or guardian with legal
             capacity to execute a local IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent
             (informed assent will be sought from capable subjects, in accordance with the
             directive of the IRB/IEC and with local requirements).

          2. Males aged 17 years and younger, at the time of parental/guardian consent and, where
             appropriate, subject assent.

               1. Elevated VLCFA values, and

               2. Active CNS disease established by central radiographic review of brain magnetic
                  resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating:

             i. Loes score between 0.5 and 9 (inclusive) on the 34-point scale, and ii. Gadolinium
             enhancement on MRI of demyelinating lesions.

          4. Neurologic Function Score (NFS) ≤ 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receipt of an allogeneic transplant or gene therapy.

             vaccinated against hepatitis B [hepatitis B surface antibody-positive] who are
             negative for other markers of prior hepatitis B infection [eg, negative for hepatitis

             and/or HBeAb positive] are also eligible for the study provided they have a negative
             test for HBV DNA. Also note that subjects who are positive for anti-hepatitis C
             antibody are eligible as long as they have a negative hepatitis C viral load).

         13. Any clinically significant cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, or other disease or
             condition that would be contraindicated for any of the other study procedures.
