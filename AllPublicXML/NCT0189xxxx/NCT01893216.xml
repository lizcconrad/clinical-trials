      To investigate the prevalence of psychological symptoms and sexual dysfunction, and to
      estimate their possible interactions in infertile men.

      Although psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression are known to be associated
      with sexual dysfunction, and their interactions have been reported by many studies,
      particularly the prevalence of these two aspects and the relationship between them in
      infertile men in China have not been well investigated.

      The investigators' aim is to evaluate the prevalence of psychological symptoms and sexual
      dysfunction and interactions between them systematically by using validated questionnaires
      and scales.
