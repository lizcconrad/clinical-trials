      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NNZ-2566 is safe and well tolerated in the
      treatment of Fragile X Syndrome in adolescent and adult males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X Syndrome is a genetically determined neurological disorder in which affected
      individuals are intellectually handicapped to varying degrees and display a variety of
      associated psychiatric symptoms. Clinically, Fragile X Syndrome is characterized by
      intellectual handicap, hyperactivity and attentional problems, autism spectrum symptoms,
      emotional lability and epilepsy. The epilepsy seen in Fragile X Syndrome is most commonly
      present in childhood, but then gradually remits towards adulthood. Physical features such as
      prominent ears and jaw, and hyper-extensibility of joints are frequently present but are not
      diagnostic. Intellectual handicap is the most common feature defining the phenotype.
      Treatment for the disorder is symptomatic - focusing on the management of symptoms - and
      supportive, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral administration
      of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescent or adult males with Fragile X Syndrome.
      The study also will also investigate measures of efficacy during treatment.

          5. Current treatment with no more than 3 psychotropic medications. This includes
             medications used to treat problems with sleep onset and sleep continuity. Melatonin
             for difficulties with sleep onset is permissible and is excepted from the count of
             psychotropic medications. Similarly, anti-epileptic medications are permitted and are
             not denoted as &quot;psychotropic medications&quot; if they are used for treatment of seizures.
             Use of anti-epileptics for other indications such as the treatment of mood disorders
             counts towards the limit of permitted medications. Concurrent use of omega-3 fatty
             acids is also permissible and does not count towards the allowed number of concomitant
             psychotropic medications. A complete list of permitted concomitant psychotropic
             medications can be found in Appendix A.

             chronic medical conditions include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and asthma.
             Every effort should be made to keep the doses and dosing regimens of these medications
             stable in the 4 weeks preceding Screening and during the period between Screening and
             the commencement of study medication.

               1. Permitted psychotropic concomitant medications (except for anti-epileptic
                  medications-see below) must be stable, in terms of dose and dosing regimen, for

               2. Anti-epileptic medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12
                  weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between
                  Screening and the commencement of study medication

          7. Behavioral treatments excluding psychotherapy (see exclusion criteria) must be stable
             for 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between
             Screening and the commencement of study medication

             a. For each enrollee, every effort should be made to maintain stable regimens of
             allowed concomitant medications and allowed behavioral therapies from the time of
