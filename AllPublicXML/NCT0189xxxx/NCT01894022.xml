  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, long term extension to Study AMB115811. All subjects may remain in the
      extension study for a minimum of 18 months. Beyond the 18-month period, subjects may continue
      in the extension study until one of the following: the product is approved locally for use in
      inoperable CTEPH patients; development for use in the CTEPH population is discontinued or
      product is not approved by the local regulatory authorities; or the investigator decides to
      discontinue the subject or subject decides to discontinue from the study. The primary purpose
      of this study is to provide clinically relevant information on the long term safety of
      ambrisentan in subjects with inoperable CTEPH.

    <measure>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline in the 6 Minutes Walking Distance (6MWD) at the Indicated Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>During Study AMB115811: Months 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, Early Withdrawal (EW); During Extension Study: Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and at End of Study (assessed up to approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walk test was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines in accordance with local standard operating procedures. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a par. can walk in a period of 6 minutes. AMB115811 Baseline was the Week 0 value in that study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Par.'s final visit in study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this extension study. For the Extension study, the visit schedule (Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15) was mapped to the visit schedule (Months 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19) for continuity with study AMB115811. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population: all par. who were randomized and took at least one dose of study medication in the double-blind phase (placebo or ambrisentan).</description>

    <measure>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline (BL) in World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class (FC) at the Indicated Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>During Study AMB115811: Months (M) 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, Early Withdrawal (EW); During Extension (ext) Study: Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and at End of Study (assessed up to approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>WHO FC indicates severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification, assessed by the investigator. There are 4 grades for WHO FC based on severity of symptoms (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). Grades mapped to numeric scale 1-4 (i.e. Class IV = 4). WHO FC system links symptoms with activity limitations, allowing clinicians to predict disease progression and prognosis. AMB115811 BL is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Change from AMB115811 BL was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the BL value (positive change = worsening). Par.'s final visit in AMB115811 was used as entry visit of this ext study. For Ext study, the visit schedule (M1,3,6,9,12 and 15) was mapped to the visit schedule (M5,7,10,13,16 and 19) for continuity with study AMB115811. Only par. available at the specified TP were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category title).</description>

    <description>BCR10S score, a rating of perceived exertion, was collected immediately following completion of the 6-minute walk test. Scores range from 0 to 10 (0=nothing at all, 10=extremely strong). If par.'s perception or feeling was stronger than &quot;10&quot;, that is &quot;extremely strong&quot;, &quot;Maximal&quot; -a larger number could be used, for example 12 or still higher, that is &quot;Absolute maximum&quot;). AMB115811 BL data was calculated as average of 2 BCR10S values obtained following the 2 6MWD tests used in determining the BL 6MWD in that study. If only 1 measurement was available, it was used. Change from AMB115811 BL was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the BL value. Par.'s final visit in AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of ext study. For the Ext study, the visit schedule (M1,3,6,9,12 and 15) mapped to the visit schedule (M5,7,10,13,16 and 19) for continuity with AMB115811. Only those par. available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category titles).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline from study AMB115811 up to End of Study for the extension study (assessed up to approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 version 2 is a self-administered, health-related quality of life (QoL) metric. It is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health as well as 2 summary measures (Physical Health and Mental Health). Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Baseline of study AMB115811 was to be used. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline was to be calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. The SF-36 data were collected, but after the study was terminated, not all endpoints listed in the protocol were analyzed, including the SF-36.

    <description>The 6 minute walk distance data in a previous outcome measure were also analyzed as change from start of ambrisentan treatment. As participants started to receive ambrisentan treatment in two studies, two different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis. For participants who received ambrisentan treatment in Study AMB115811, the Baseline for that study was used. For participants who received placebo in Study AMB115811, entry visit of the Extension study was defined as Baseline. Change from start of ambrisentan was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the start of ambrisentan value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category title).</description>

As par. started to receive ambrisentan treatment in 2 studies, 2 different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis. For par. who received ambrisentan treatment in study AMB115811, the Baseline for that study was used. For par. who received placebo in Study AMB115811, entry visit of the Extension study was defined as Baseline. Only those par. available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category title).</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was an open label, long-term extension study to the double-blind, placebo-controlled study AMB115811 (NCT01884675). Only those participants (par.) in study AMB115811 were eligible for enrollment in this study. The planned duration was a minimum of 18 months, but the study was terminated due to futility of enrollment in study AMB115811.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of the 33 participants randomized (16 participants in the Placebo arm and 17 in the Ambrisentan arm) in study AMB115811, a total of 19 participants were enrolled in this extension study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Entry visit of the extension study, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15, and end of study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline in basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, total neutrophils (ANC), platelet count, and WBC count are summarized. AMB115811 Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Change from AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Participant's final visit in Study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this open-label extension study. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). NA indicates that data were not available.</description>

          <title>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline in Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Total Neutrophils (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC]), Platelet Count, and White Blood Cell (WBC) Count at the Indicated Time Points</title>
          <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Entry visit of the extension study, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15, and end of study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline in basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, total neutrophils (ANC), platelet count, and WBC count are summarized. AMB115811 Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Change from AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Participant's final visit in Study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this open-label extension study. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). NA indicates that data were not available.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Entry visit of the extension study, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15, and end of study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline in hemoglobin and MCHC is summarized. AMB115811 Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Change from AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Participant's final visit in Study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this open-label extension study. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). NA indicates that data were not available.</description>

          <description>Hematology parameters were assessed at Entry visit of the extension study, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15, and end of study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline in red blood cell count and reticulocytes is summarized. AMB115811 Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Change from AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Participant's final visit in study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this open-label extension study. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). NA indicates that data were not available.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected post Entry visit of the extension study and up to end of study for evaluation of the clinical chemistry parameters of alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin. The clinical chemistry parameters of potential clinical concern high were defined as follows: ALT, AST, GGT &gt;=3 times upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin &gt;=2 times ULN. Participants with both normal and high values were counted once under their worst case (high). Participant's final visit in study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this open-label extension study.</description>

        <title>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline in the 6 Minutes Walking Distance (6MWD) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>The 6-minute walk test was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines in accordance with local standard operating procedures. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a par. can walk in a period of 6 minutes. AMB115811 Baseline was the Week 0 value in that study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Par.'s final visit in study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this extension study. For the Extension study, the visit schedule (Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15) was mapped to the visit schedule (Months 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19) for continuity with study AMB115811. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population: all par. who were randomized and took at least one dose of study medication in the double-blind phase (placebo or ambrisentan).</description>

          <title>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline in the 6 Minutes Walking Distance (6MWD) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
          <description>The 6-minute walk test was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines in accordance with local standard operating procedures. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a par. can walk in a period of 6 minutes. AMB115811 Baseline was the Week 0 value in that study. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. Par.'s final visit in study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this extension study. For the Extension study, the visit schedule (Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15) was mapped to the visit schedule (Months 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19) for continuity with study AMB115811. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population: all par. who were randomized and took at least one dose of study medication in the double-blind phase (placebo or ambrisentan).</description>

        <title>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline (BL) in World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class (FC) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>WHO FC indicates severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification, assessed by the investigator. There are 4 grades for WHO FC based on severity of symptoms (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). Grades mapped to numeric scale 1-4 (i.e. Class IV = 4). WHO FC system links symptoms with activity limitations, allowing clinicians to predict disease progression and prognosis. AMB115811 BL is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Change from AMB115811 BL was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the BL value (positive change = worsening). Par.'s final visit in AMB115811 was used as entry visit of this ext study. For Ext study, the visit schedule (M1,3,6,9,12 and 15) was mapped to the visit schedule (M5,7,10,13,16 and 19) for continuity with study AMB115811. Only par. available at the specified TP were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category title).</description>

        <title>Change From Study AMB115811 Baseline in Borg CR10 Scale (BCR10S) Immediately Following Exercise at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>BCR10S score, a rating of perceived exertion, was collected immediately following completion of the 6-minute walk test. Scores range from 0 to 10 (0=nothing at all, 10=extremely strong). If par.'s perception or feeling was stronger than &quot;10&quot;, that is “extremely strong”, “Maximal” –a larger number could be used, for example 12 or still higher, that is “Absolute maximum”). AMB115811 BL data was calculated as average of 2 BCR10S values obtained following the 2 6MWD tests used in determining the BL 6MWD in that study. If only 1 measurement was available, it was used. Change from AMB115811 BL was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the BL value. Par.'s final visit in AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of ext study. For the Ext study, the visit schedule (M1,3,6,9,12 and 15) mapped to the visit schedule (M5,7,10,13,16 and 19) for continuity with AMB115811. Only those par. available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>The SF-36 version 2 is a self-administered, health-related quality of life (QoL) metric. It is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health as well as 2 summary measures (Physical Health and Mental Health). Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Baseline of study AMB115811 was to be used. Change from study AMB115811 Baseline was to be calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value. The SF-36 data were collected, but after the study was terminated, not all endpoints listed in the protocol were analyzed, including the SF-36. This decision was documented in the reporting and analysis plan prior to database lock.</description>

        <description>The ratio to Baseline in NT-proBNP was calculated as the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to the AMB115811 Baseline value and was expressed as a percent change from AMB115811 Baseline. This was done by taking the mean change on the log scale, exponentiating, subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100. Standard deviation (SD) of the logged values (log[SD]) have been presented. AMB115811 Baseline is the last value recorded on or prior to start of study treatment in that study. Participant's final visit in study AMB115811 was used as the entry visit of this open-label extension study. For the Extension study, the visit schedule (Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15) was mapped to the visit schedule (Months 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19) for continuity with study AMB115811. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). NA indicates that data were not available.</description>

As participants started to receive ambrisentan treatment in two studies, two different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis.

        <description>The WHO functional class data in a previous outcome measure were also analyzed as change from start of ambrisentan treatment. There are 4 grades for WHO FC based on severity of symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). Grades mapped to numeric scale 1-4 (i.e. Class IV = 4). As participants started to receive ambrisentan treatment in two studies, two different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis. For participants who received ambrisentan treatment in Study AMB115811, the Baseline for that study was used. For participants who received placebo in Study AMB115811, entry visit of the Extension study was defined as Baseline. Change from start of ambrisentan was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the start of ambrisentan value (positive change = worsening). Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>The BCR10S data in a previous outcome measure were also analyzed as change from start of ambrisentan treatment. BCR10S score, a rating of perceived exertion, ranges from 0 to 10 (0=nothing at all, 10 extremely strong). If par.’s perception or feeling was stronger than “10”, a larger number could be used. As participants started to receive ambrisentan treatment in two studies, two different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis. For participants who received ambrisentan treatment in Study AMB115811, the Baseline for that study was used. For participants who received placebo in Study AMB115811, entry visit of the Extension study was defined as Baseline. Change from start of ambrisentan was calculated as the value at the indicated visit minus the start of ambrisentan value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category title).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Start of Ambrisentan Treatment in Plasma N-terminal Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP)</title>
        <description>The NT-proBNP data in a previous outcome measure were also analyzed as change from start of ambrisentan treatment. The ratio to start of ambrisentan in NT-proBNP was calculated as the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to the start of ambrisentan value and was expressed as a percent change from start of ambrisentan. This was done by taking the mean change on the log scale, exponentiating, subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100. Standard deviation (SD) of the logged values (log[SD]) have been presented. As par. started to receive ambrisentan treatment in 2 studies, 2 different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis. For par. who received ambrisentan treatment in study AMB115811, the Baseline for that study was used. For par. who received placebo in Study AMB115811, entry visit of the Extension study was defined as Baseline. Only those par. available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category title).</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Start of Ambrisentan Treatment in Plasma N-terminal Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP)</title>
          <description>The NT-proBNP data in a previous outcome measure were also analyzed as change from start of ambrisentan treatment. The ratio to start of ambrisentan in NT-proBNP was calculated as the ratio of the value at the specified time-point to the start of ambrisentan value and was expressed as a percent change from start of ambrisentan. This was done by taking the mean change on the log scale, exponentiating, subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100. Standard deviation (SD) of the logged values (log[SD]) have been presented. As par. started to receive ambrisentan treatment in 2 studies, 2 different time points for start of ambrisentan treatment were used for this analysis. For par. who received ambrisentan treatment in study AMB115811, the Baseline for that study was used. For par. who received placebo in Study AMB115811, entry visit of the Extension study was defined as Baseline. Only those par. available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category title).</description>
