      The purpose of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system in
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes in an outpatient setting, and to evaluate the CTR system's
      ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels when an insulin bolus is omitted for a
      30 gram carbohydrate snack and when insulin bolus is insufficient for the amount of
      carbohydrates consumed for a meal. The primary objective of this study is to use a
      closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system to significantly reduce the post-prandial blood
      glucose excursion in adolescents with type 1 diabetes who omit and/or under-bolus insulin for
      either snacks or meals. Up to 20 subjects aged ≥13 and ≤18 years old will be tested.

      The purpose of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system in
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes in an outpatient setting, and to evaluate the CTR system's
      ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels when an insulin bolus is omitted for a
      30 gram carbohydrate snack and when insulin bolus is insufficient for the amount of
      carbohydrates consumed for a meal. The CTR system is comprised of two algorithmic layers: (i)
      A Safety Supervision Module (SSM) which contains a predictive insulin request dampener (or
      brakes); (ii) a Range Correction Module (RCM), consisting in (a) a Hyperglycemia Mitigation
      System, and (b) Insulin on Board controller. Both modules will receive continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) and historical insulin delivery data. The SSM will monitor the safety of the
      subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to prevent hypoglycemia. The
      RCM will be responsible for optimizing blood glucose (BG) control and mitigating postprandial
      hyperglycemic excursions through a mix of increased basal rate and, potentially, isolated
      insulin boluses. To run CTR, we will use our wearable artificial pancreas platform, known as
      DiAs (Diabetes Assistant) which consists of a smart phone running CTR and connected to
      standard insulin delivery and CGM devices.
