    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different methods of collecting the amount of
      radiation exposure patients receive in a clinical study. As part of the PROMISE study, the
      Duke Clinical Research Institute Outcomes and Follow-up Group will be contacting patients
      every six months to ask if they had any heart procedures or testing. This information will be
      used to estimate the amount of radiation that they may have received from heart testing being
      studied in this study, PROMISE-SAFER. Patients will be asked to collect information about
      each heart testing they receive during the time that they are enrolled in the PROMISE study.
      At the conclusion of the study, we will be able to determine which method was most accurate
      in collecting the amount of radiation exposure for this clinical study. Through this study we
      hope to develop an improved methodology to estimate cumulative radiation exposure from
      cardiac imaging. Comprehensive measurement of cumulative radiation exposure to patients may
      be critically important to minimize potential harm in future studies and in clinical
      practice.

    <description>In a single site (San Jose Medical Center - Kaiser Permanente) at a health maintenance organization where patients undergo all testing on site and comprehensive radiation records are maintained, 3 approaches to obtaining follow-up radiation dosimetry estimates will be compared: 1) the standard method used at all sites of combining those procedures identified on follow-up surveys with measured or imputed procedure dose estimates, 2) Radiation Log forms that patients will receive and will be asked to complete whenever they undergo further imaging, and 3) &quot;gold standard&quot; review of patient electronic medical records to identify all procedures with ionizing radiation and measured dose estimates from each procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: All patients who meet inclusion criteria and enroll in the parent
        PROMISE study will be eligible to participate in PROMISE-SAFER.

          1. New or worsening chest pain syndrome or equivalent symptoms suspicious for clinically
             significant coronary artery disease

          2. No prior evaluation for this episode of symptoms

          3. Planned non-invasive testing for evaluation of possible coronary artery disease

          4. Men age &gt; 55 and women age ≥65 years

          5. If age in men 45 - 54 or women 50 - 64 years, then must have increased probability of
             CAD due to EITHER:

             A. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) requiring medical treatment OR Peripheral Arterial Disease
             (PAD) defined as documented &gt;50% peripheral arterial stenosis treated medically or
             invasively OR Cerebrovascular disease (stroke, documented &gt; 50% carotid stenosis
             treated medically or invasively)

             OR

             B. At least one of the following cardiovascular risk factors:

               -  Ongoing tobacco use

               -  Hypertension

               -  Abnormal ankle-brachial index defined as less than &lt;0.9

               -  Dyslipidemia

          6. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL within the past 90 days

          7. Negative urine/serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child-bearing potential and
             not breast-feeding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed or suspected acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization or urgent or
             emergent testing; Elevated troponin or creatinine kinase-MB

          2. Hemodynamically or clinically unstable condition (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg,
             atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or persistent resting chest pain felt to be
             ischemic despite adequate therapy)

          3. Known coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary
             intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting or any angiographic evidence of coronary
             artery disease ≥50% lesion in a major epicardial vessel.

          4. Any invasive coronary angiography or non-invasive anatomic or functional
             cardiovascular test for detection of coronary artery disease, including coronary
             computed tomographic angiography and exercise electrocardiogram, within the previous
             twelve (12) months.
