  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) vaccine, when
      given in combination with montanide and GM-CSF, can help to prevent or delay mesothelioma
      from coming back after surgery and treatment. The safety of this vaccine will also be tested.

      Montanide and GM-CSF are designed to cause white blood cells to grow, which may help to
      increase the immune response.

      WT1 is a protein in cancer cells that regulates gene expression and causes cell growth.
      Mesothelioma tumors usually have high levels of WT1. The WT1 vaccine is designed to cause the
      increased immune response created by other drug combinations (like montanide and GM-CSF) to
      be directed at mesothelioma.

      Study Drug Administration:

      When this study opened, it had 2 groups. In 1 of the groups, participants only received
      montanide and GM-CSF. This group has stopped enrolling participants. All participants will
      now receive montanide, GM-CSF, and the WT1 vaccine.

      You will receive montanide through an injection under the skin every 2 weeks for up to 12
      weeks (6 doses). You will receive the WT-1 vaccine at the same time that you receive
      montanide.

      You will also receive GM-CSF through an injection under the skin on the day you receive
      montanide and 2 days before you receive montanide each time (12 doses of GM-CSF total). If
      the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you might be taught how to inject the GM-CSF
      yourself.

      Study Visits:

      On Week 2, Week 6, and Week 12, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your
      weight and vital signs. You will also be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side
      effects you may be having.

      At Weeks 6 and 12, the following tests and procedures will also be performed:

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your level of SMRP.

        -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune response to the study
           drug(s) (Week 12 only).

      At Week 12 or earlier if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray and CT
      scan of the chest to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive the study drugs for up to 12 weeks. You will be taken off study if the study
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest or you have intolerable side effects.

      Your participation in the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days after you stop receiving the study drugs, you will have a physical exam,
      including measurement of your weight and vital signs. You will also be asked about any drugs
      you may be taking and any side effects you may be having.

      Every 3 months for up to 2 years after you stop receiving the study drugs, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure your levels
           of SMRP.

        -  You will have a CT scan of the chest to check the status of the disease

      This is an investigational study. GM-CSF is FDA approved for helping the immune system in
      patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Montanide and Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) are not FDA
      approved or commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only.

      The combination of WT-1 vaccine with montanide and GM-CSF is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 60 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 20 will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson.

             will still be eligible. Patients should have also received treatment with chemotherapy
             and/or radiation. Patients with an R2 resection are also eligible as long as the sites
             of residual disease is treated post-operatively with radiotherapy.

          4. 4-12 weeks since completion of combined modality therapy.

          5. Age &gt;/= 18 years.

             able to have children that has not been surgically sterilized or amenorrheic for 12
             consecutive months. The patient, if a man, agrees to use effective contraception or
             abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by urine or serum Beta-HCG if applicable) or is

          2. Patients with active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antiviral, or
             antifungal treatments

          3. Patients with a serious unstable medical illness that would prevent compliance with
