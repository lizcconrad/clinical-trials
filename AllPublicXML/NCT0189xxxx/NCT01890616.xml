      In this research study the investigators want to learn more about gut transit times in
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients over 18.

      The investigators hypothesized:

        1. DMD patients will exhibit prolonged gut transit times when compared to the general
           population;

        2. Abnormal transit times will correlate with increased age and worsening functional
           status.

      The following procedures will take place during the study.

      Constipation Assessment:

        -  The patient will be asked to complete a questionnaire about any symptoms of
           constipation.

        -  A physician from the study team will perform an abdominal physical exam

        -  The patient will have routine x-rays that monitor for spine compression fractures. These
           films will also be used to assess stool content.

      Clinical Information The following information will also be collected during the clinic visit
      ;

        -  Age at diagnosis and genetic mutation

        -  Age at loss of ambulation if applicable

        -  Medications

        -  Functional status

      Ingestion of the Wireless Motility Capsule (WMC) Smart Pill capsule:

      It is necessary for the patient to not have anything to eat or drink for 12 hours prior to
      swallowing the Smart Pill. Before the capsule is ingested, it is necessary to eat a standard
      low fat meal. As it is important this meal is the same in all study participants, the meal
      will be provided as a Smart Bar. This is a custom formulation nutritional bar that is
      equivalent to egg beaters, toast and jelly.

        -  In clinic the patient will be provided a Smart Bar to eat with Â½ cup of water

        -  The patient will then be asked to swallow the Smart Pill with an additional 2 ounces
           (1/4 cup) of water. The time of ingestion will be recorded in the subject diary.

        -  The patient will not be able to eat for an additional 6 hours after swallowing the Smart
           Pill, but will be allowed a small amount of beverage during this time, up to 1/3 cup.

        -  After the 6 hours the patient may resume regular diet.

      The patient will need to remain in the clinic for one hour after swallowing the Smart Pill,
      so the study team can determine if the monitor is functioning properly. During that time the
      patient will be instructed on:

        -  The receiving monitor; it must be worn at all times (except during bathing). The monitor
           needs to be worn on the patient's belt or waistband and needs to remain within 5 feet at
           all times. The patient will be asked to push the event button on the receiver to record
           the times of certain events (for example, bowel movements, meals, going to bed and
           getting up in the morning).

        -  Completing the subject diary and the responsibility of recording events. Examples of
           events are listed above.

        -  How to monitor for passage of the Smart Pill. This can be observance in stool, and can
           also be monitored by loss of signal transmission. This usually occurs within five days
           after ingestion of the Smart Pill. The patient do not need to return the pill; it can be
           flushed down the toilet.

        -  Returning the monitor and completed diary to the study team as soon as the five days
           have completed. The patient will be provided a pre-paid mailer.
