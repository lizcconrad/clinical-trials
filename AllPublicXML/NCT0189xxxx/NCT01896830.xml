      The aim of the study is to evaluate a candidate C. difficile Toxoid Vaccine in the Japanese
      population.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profile of all subjects who receive at least 1 injection

        -  To describe the immunogenicity to toxin A and toxin B in all subjects from serum samples
           obtained on Days 0, 14, 30, and 60.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the vaccine or placebo on the selected
      schedule. Safety parameters, solicited injection site and systemic reactions will be
      collected for 6 days after each injection; unsolicited adverse events including serious
      adverse events will be collected up to Day 60 post-vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult subjects aged 40 to 75 years on the day of inclusion

          -  Informed consent form has been signed and dated

          -  Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of
             non-childbearing potential, a female must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from
             at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the
             last vaccination)

          -  Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned
             participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating
             a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination, except
             for influenza (seasonal or pandemic) and pneumococcal vaccine.

             event has subsided

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member

          -  Subject who has concomitant disease that, according to
             investigator's/sub-investigator's judgment, would adversely affect the safety of the
             subject in the study, e.g., cardiovascular disease, renal disease, hepatic disease,
             hematologic disease, and/or growth impairment

          -  Subject with a past history of convulsions
