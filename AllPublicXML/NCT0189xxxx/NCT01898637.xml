  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine if the change in oxygen saturation during deep
      inspiration (&quot;augmented pulse oximetry&quot;) can be used as a method to rule out pulmonary
      embolism (PE). The investigators propose to evaluate a simple, non-invasive clinical tool to
      help rule out PE. The investigators plan to measure the oxygen saturation of 40 consecutive
      patients with newly-diagnosed PE (within 60 minutes of diagnosis) and 80 matched controls who
      do not have a PE. Trained, blinded Respiratory Therapists or Study Coordinators will record
      each patient's oxygen saturation before, during, and after a 2-minute period of deep
      inspirations (vital capacity [the maximal amount of air that can be inhaled, measured in
      milliliters]) using an incentive spirometer. The investigators' central hypothesis is that
      persons with a PE will not respond to augmented pulse oximetry and will not significantly
      improve or normalize their oxygen saturation.

      Patients will be identified and enrolled by the Mayo Clinic St. Marys Emergency Department
      staff as they are undergoing medical care in the Emergency Department.

      The investigators will calculate the difference in oxygen saturation pre- and post-deep
      inspiration (ΔSpO2 at 1 minute, 2 minutes and 4 minutes), and then correlate these values
      with the CT result.

      In cases of PE, The investigators expect the SpO2 to remain unchanged, or to change less than
      3-5%. The investigators expect alternate hypoxemic conditions to have a significantly greater
      increase in SpO2.
