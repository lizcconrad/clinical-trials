      The purpose of this study is the comparative evaluation of systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      lowering, atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence and clinical data in patients with
      paroxysmal/persistent AF and resistant/non-resistant hypertension, undergoing AF ablation
      alone or combined with percutaneous renal denervation.

      On the basis of the eligibility criteria, patients is assigned by the enrolling physician to
      one of two strata. The first stratum includes patients with moderate drug-resistant
      hypertension, defined by the Joint National Committee VII and ESH/ESC guidelines as office BP
      ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and &lt;160/100 mm Hg. The second stratum includes patients with drug-resistant
      hypertension, defined by office BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg.

    <description>The left atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) are explored through a transeptal approach. Real-time 3D LA maps are reconstructed by using a nonfluoroscopic navigation system. The ipsilateral left and right PVs are encircled in one lesion line by circumferential PV isolation. Radiofrequency energy is delivered at 43°C, 35 W, 0.5 cm away from the PV ostia at the anterior wall, and is reduced to 43°C, 30 W, 1 cm away from the PV ostia at the posterior wall, with a saline irrigation speed of 17 mL/min. Each lesion is ablated continuously until the local potential amplitude decreased by &gt;80% or RF energy deliveries exceeded 40 s. The endpoint of circumferential PV isolation is PV isolation. Additional ablation lines are created by connecting the left inferior PV to the mitral annulus (mitral isthmus) and the roof of the LA between the two superior PVs. After the end of the procedure the implantable loop recorder is implanted in the parasternal area of the chest.</description>

    <description>The procedure of AF ablation is the same like in the circumferential PV isolation.
After AF ablation procedure, the angiogram of both renal arteries is performed via femoral access. After that the treatment catheter is introduced into each renal artery and is applied discrete, radiofrequency ablations lasting up to 2 min each and of 8 watts or less to obtain up to six ablations separated both longitudinally and rotationally within each renal artery. During ablation, the catheter system monitored tip temperature and impedance, altering radiofrequency energy delivery in response to a predetermined algorithm. After the procedure the control arterial angiogram should be done.</description>
