      This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1b trial of MLN0128 (an oral mTORC1/2
      inhibitor) in combination with MLN1117 (an oral inhibitor of the PI3K (alpha) isoform) when
      administered to adult patients with advanced nonhematological malignancies.

             study drug

          -  Previous treatment with MLN1117 and/or MLN0128; previous treatment with dual mTORC1/2

             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation) within 1 year
             before screening

          -  Patients who are taking proton pump inhibitors within 7 days of the first dose or who
             require treatment with proton pump inhibitors during the trial or those who are taking
             H2 receptor antagonists within 24 hours of the first dose

          -  Patients who received previous therapy with PI3K inhibitors or rapalogs will be
             allowed in the study if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met

          -  Diagnosis of primary brain tumor or symptomatic brain metastasis. Patients with brain
             metastases must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation
             of neurologic and other AEs
