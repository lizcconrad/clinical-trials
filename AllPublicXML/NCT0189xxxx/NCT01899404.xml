  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for cervix cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital is external radiation
      with chemotherapy followed by internal radiation, called brachytherapy. Currently,
      brachytherapy treatment is planned on a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) called
      T2-weighted (T2W) MRI.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the following imaging tests can
      visualize the tumor better for planning the brachytherapy treatment:

        1. special types of MRI called diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) and dynamic-contrast enhanced
           MRI (DCE-MRI); and

        2. an x-ray test called positron emission test (PET) performed with a sugar dye called FDG.
           MRI-guided brachytherapy is resource-intensive and not widely available.
