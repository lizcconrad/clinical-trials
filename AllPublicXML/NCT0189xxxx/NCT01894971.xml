    <textblock>
      Single-center prospective randomized trial to evaluate the effect of thermal damage of
      Ligasure® to destroy cornual portion of fallopian tube tisse.

      Right of Left side of fallpian tube is randomized and coagulated one more time than other
      side before cut off. The pathologist evaluate the amount of fallopian tube tissue left at
      both cornual portion of cut off specimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When investigators perform salpingectomy, both side of cornual portion of the uterus are
      coagulated by Ligasure®. The randomized, the same word selected side of the fallopian tube is
      coagulated one more time at the cornual portion than unselected other side of fallopian tube.
      Hypothesis is that the side selected and coagulated twice would have less fallopian tube
      tisse left at fianl pathology than the side only once coagulated by Ligasure®.
