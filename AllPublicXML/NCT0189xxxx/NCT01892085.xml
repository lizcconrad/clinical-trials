  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling evidence exists that breast milk helps protect very premature infants from
      prematurity-specific morbidities. Unfortunately, mothers of premature infants often exhibit
      delayed lactogenesis stage II (when the milk &quot;comes in&quot;) and decreased breast milk
      production. Several studies have linked earlier initiation of breast milk expression
      following delivery with a greater milk production. However, none conclusively determined the
      optimal timing of breast milk expression. As a result these mothers continue to struggle with
      inadequate breast milk production. This study will follow 180 mothers of premature infants
      for 6 weeks following delivery to test

      Earlier initiation of breast milk expression following delivery is associated with (1) an
      earlier lactogenesis stage II, (2) greater volume of breast milk production during the first
      6 weeks, (3) improved short-term infant health outcomes and (4) women who deliver at an
      earlier gestation will have decreased milk production and a later lactogenesis stage II.
      Following stratification according to the gestational age of the infant (23-27 weeks vs.
      28-32 weeks), eligible women will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and instructed
      to start mechanically expressing their r breasts, either in the first hour, 1-3 hours or 3-6
      hours following delivery. The timing of lactogenesis stage II will be documented, and the
      volume of breast milk produced will continue to be measured for the first 6 weeks following
      delivery and at discharge. Infant nutritional outcomes will be measured throughout the 6-week
      study. The impact of the differences in timing of initiation of milk expression following
      delivery on timing of lactogenesis stage II, milk volume, short term nutritional outcomes,
      amount of breast milk feedings at discharge, and impact of gestational age on milk volume and
      lactogenesis stage II will be determined.

      Mothers will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 will begin pumping their
      breasts with the assistance of medical or nursing personnel within 60 minutes following
      delivery. Group 2 will begin pumping their breasts with the assistance of medical or nursing
      personnel within 1- less than 3 hours following delivery. Group 3 will begin pumping their
      breasts with the assistance of medical or nursing personnel 3-6 hours following delivery.
      Mothers will also do the following

        1. Complete a log with information about their daily breast pumping sessions for 6 weeks.

        2. Bring your breast milk to the neonatal intensive care unit when they visit and the milk
           will be weighed to determine the volume of milk.

        3. Episodes of kangaroo care (placing the infant on your bare chest) will be collected.

        4. Receive a call beginning the day after you delivery and then daily until their milk
           comes in to ask about a feeling of fullness in their breasts.

      In addition the following will be done

        1. If their infant breastfeeds, he/she will be weighed before and after feeding to collect
           data on how much milk he/she ate from the breast

        2. Information regarding infant's weekly breast milk intake and breast milk intake at
           discharge will be collected
