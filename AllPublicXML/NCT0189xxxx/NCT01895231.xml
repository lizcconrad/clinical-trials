  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside 1000
      compared with placebo on Hb in first-time female donors with p-ferritin below 30 µg/L

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, clinical efficacy and safety data is available for iron isomaltoside 1000
      administered to patients with IDA requiring iron therapy. However, there is a need for
      clinical efficacy and safety data within iron deficiency without anaemia which is e.g.
      observed in blood donors. Thus, this study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of
      parenteral iron isomaltoside 1000 with placebo in female blood donors with a p-ferritin below
      30 µg/L.
