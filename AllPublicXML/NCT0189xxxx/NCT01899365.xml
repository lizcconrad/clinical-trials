  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background :

      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a threat in industrialized countries. It represents the
      6th cause of death. CAP also frequently associates with other disorders responsible for
      admission and death. Among bacteria responsible for CAP, Streptococcus pneumonia is a major
      pathogen that is commonly involved and frequently leads to severe infection and admission.
      Categories at risk for this pathogen have been determined, and can be proposed
      anti-pneumococcal vaccination (APV) that efficiently and safely protects from this
      microorganism.

      In the context of US health services, monocenter pilot experiences have reported improvement
      of pneumococcal prophylaxis implementing vaccination procedure at ED. A study that set in New
      Mexico (2003) reported a significant increase in APV (from 18% to 84%) when patients at risk
      were proposed vaccination at ED. To obtain these results, medical students were specifically
      trained and dedicated to screen and vaccinate against St. pneumoniae. Another single center
      trial (Tennessee, 2007) for APV at ED obtained an improvement (from 38.8 to 45.4%) when
      physicians were alerted for pneumococcal risk by the software they usually utilized at
      bedside. However these experiences remain sparse as additional dedicated resources are
      required or patients and attending ED physicians can be reluctant to proceed to vaccination
      at ED.

      Mobile phone and derived communication modalities are current vectors to deliver information
      in several fields including education and medicine. Initially used in developing countries,
      short-message services (SMS) have improved behaviour of patients in various medical areas. In
      France, the investigators have observed that most patients above 50 years of age admitted
      after ED visit are equipped with mobile phone and can receive alerts by SMS.

      These observations prompt us to propose a multifaceted procedure to improve APV after ED
      visit in at-risk patients, combining structured oral interview, written information and SMS
      as reminders.

      Purpose : The investigators hypothesized that

        -  a multifaceted intervention to promote anti-pneumococcal vaccination combining a
           structured oral interview, a written information to patient and his/her general
           practitioner, and a series of 3 SMS,

        -  improves anti-pneumococcal vaccination at 6 months,

        -  in at-risk patients (65+ years) visiting the emergency department. In order to answer
           this question, the investigators designed an interventional prospective multicenter
           randomized study (cluster).
