  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in this study, we are trying to monitor the effect of the addition of growth hormone on the
      different down regulation protocols ( long, short, antagonist and microflare). The outcome
      will be primarily assessed by the clinical pregnancy rates.

    <textblock>
      Poor responders undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles have emerged as a major problem. the need to find
      a proper stimulation protocol is a must. in this study we are trying to detect the best
      stimulation protocol ,in addition to growth hormone ,that can give the highest pregnancy
      rates in these patients.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>The Long protocol</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the group A received a long protocol of pituitary down-regulation with triptorelin (Decapeptyl; Ferring, Switzerland) which started on day 21 of preceding cycle at a dose of 0.1 mg/day. On the second day of menstruation HMG was started and this was associated with reduction of triptorelin to 0.05 mg/day. This reduced daily dose was administered until the day hCG was given. Growth hormone co-treatment was administrated on day 6 of HMG stimulation daily in a dose of 2.5 mg S.C. till the day of hCG administration.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>The Short protocol</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The short agonist protocol was started on cycle day 1 with triptorelin (Decapeptyl Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Germany) 0.05 mg/day S.C. Human menopausal gonadotropin IM daily (HMG 75 IU, Merional, IBSA) were also administered starting from days 2 to 3 of cycle. The dose was adjusted for each patient according to the diameter of the follicles detected in their follow up ultrasound. Growth hormone (Norditropin, Novo nordisk) was administrated on day 6 of HMG stimulation daily in a dose of 2.5 mg S.C. till the day of hCG administration.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>The Antagonist protocol</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Gonadotrophins IM daily (HMG 75 IU, Merional, IBSA)was administrated from day 2 of the cycle. Growth hormone (Norditropin, Novo nordisk) was administrated on day 6 of HMG stimulation daily in a dose of 2.5 mg S.C. till the day of hCG administration. The GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide) was given when the leading follicle was from 12 to 14 mm, at a daily dose of 0.25 mg SC.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>The Microflare protocol</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>the patients in this group were given oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for 28 days, this was followed by 2 days free. Triptorelin (Decapeptyl Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Germany) 0.05 mg/day S.C. was then started daily followed by human menopausal gonadotropin IM daily (HMG 75 IU, Merional, IBSA) 3 days later. Growth hormone (Norditropin, Novo nordisk) was administrated on day 6 of HMG stimulation daily in a dose of 2.5 mg S.C. till the day of hCG administration.</description>
