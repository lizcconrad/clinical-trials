    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide safety and efficacy data for the X-Suit NIR® Covered
      Biliary Metallic Stent for subjects with malignant stricture(s) in the biliary tree. The
      study is designed to support the regulatory requirement of a 510(k) marketing application in
      the United States.

      This is a non-randomized, multi-center, prospective, single arm clinical study of the X-Suit
      NIR® Covered Biliary Metallic Stent for the palliation of malignant strictures in the biliary
      tree via endoscopic approach.

      Adult males and females (≥ 18 years old), with clinical symptoms of biliary obstruction and
      inoperable extrahepatic biliary obstruction by any malignant process.

      The expected duration of this study is approximately 18 months from the time of first subject
      enrollment to the time of the last subject's 6-month post stent implantation follow-up visit.
