    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of smoking low nicotine cigarettes in different groups of
      smokers. The investigators are focusing on differences in how smokers' bodies break down and
      eliminate nicotine from their systems. Some people are fast metabolizers of nicotine, meaning
      they break down and eliminate nicotine from their bodies more quickly. Other people are
      slower metabolizers meaning they break down and eliminate nicotine more slowly. The
      investigators are comparing these two groups of smokers for their responses to low nicotine
      cigarettes. The investigators hypothesize that individuals who smoke low nicotine cigarettes
      may smoke more intensely or smoke more each day, thereby maintaining their desired nicotine
      levels, and as a result continue to be exposed to significant toxin levels.

      This study examines the effects of smoking low nicotine cigarettes on smoking behaviors and
      toxin exposure in fast and slow nicotine metabolizing smokers. We will recruit current
      smokers (split between slow and rapid nicotine metabolizing smokers) for a 35-day protocol.
      Participants will smoke their own brand cigarettes during a baseline 5 day period, followed
      by a 15-day period of smoking low nicotine content cigarette level 1: 0.25 mg nicotine
      content, followed by a 15-day period of smoking low nicotine content cigarette level 2: 0.08
      mg nicotine content. This application is designed to provide empirical science to inform the
      FDA on the effect smoking low nicotine content cigarettes will have on use patterns and harm
      exposure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. adults age 21-65.

          2. smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day.

          3. smoking daily for the last 5 years.

          4. Provide a baseline breath CO reading equal to or greater than 10 parts per million.

          5. smoke predominantly non-menthol filtered cigarettes (research cigarettes are only
             non-menthol).

          6. not currently using any other nicotine containing products such as cigars, smokeless
             tobacco, nicotine replacement therapies (patch or gum).

          7. are fluent in English and are capable of providing written informed consent, which
             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the combined
             consent and HIPAA form.

        Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and attend an Intake Visit for
        medical screening will be asked to provide a blood sample to determine NMR. Only those
        individuals who are characterized as slow or rapid, based on NMRs ≤ .26, or ≥ .42, will be
        eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. use of any nicotine containing products other than cigarettes

          2. current or impending enrollment in smoking cessation program

          3. history in the last year or current treatment of substance abuse (other than nicotine
             dependence)

          4. positive drug screen for cocaine, methamphetamines or opiates for urine drug screen at
             intake session

          5. alcohol use greater than 25 standard drinks per week

          6. current or planned pregnancy or lactating

          7. history or current diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, mania, or schizophrenia

          8. current major depression (history of major depression but in remission for a minimum 6
             months is eligible).

          9. serious or unstable disease within past year (e.g. cancer other than melanoma, heart
             disease)

         10. history or current diagnosis of COPD

         11. history of stroke or heart attack

         12. age less than 21 years- We wish to recruit smokers with well established smoking
             patterns and will restrict recruitment to those over 21

         13. age more than 65 years - smoking is often associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary
             obstructive diseases that manifest later in life. As smokers develop these problems,
             smoking behavior and biomarkers of harm may be affected therefore we will restrict
             enrollment to those under age 65

         14. provide baseline CO reading less than 10 at initial session

         15. current use (or use within past 14 days) of any medication that affects the
             biotransformation of nicotine, such as anticonvulsant drugs, rifampin, and disulfiram;
             or any psychoactive medications which can affect smoking behaviors

         16. any conditions viewed by the PI or study physician as creating a potential increased
             risk to a participant due to their participation will be reasons for exclusion

         17. at the discretion of the PI, any participants viewed as non-compliant will be excluded
             from further participation

         18. Smoke cigarettes with a filter size other than standard or slim sized as the
             topography mouthpieces are sized for standard filters and have an adapter for slim
             cigarettes only.
