    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out more information such as: to determine the
      effects of high and low fat foods on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral KPT-330 tablets, to
      compare PK of capsules and tablets, to assess the effects of KPT-330 on cellular morphology
      and biomarker changes on sarcoma biopsy specimens (in patients who can safely undergo
      biopsy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed soft tissue or bone/cartilage sarcoma.
             Patients with sarcoma of small round blue cell tumor types are allowed.
             Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are excluded.

          2. Patients must have received at least one prior anticancer regimen for metastatic
             disease unless there is no other therapy available and evidence of progressive disease
             on study entry. Patients with stable disease will be included if there has been
             failure to respond to another drug(s) within the previous 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known liver metastases

          2. Radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, any other systemic anticancer therapy or
             participation in an investigational anti-cancer study ≤ 3 weeks prior to initiation of
             therapy

          3. Patients with known brain metastasis

          4. Patients with any gastrointestinal dysfunctions that could interfere with the
             interpretation of the food effect data

          5. Patients with known intolerance to low or high fat meals

          6. In the opinion of the investigator, patients who are significantly below their ideal
             body weight
