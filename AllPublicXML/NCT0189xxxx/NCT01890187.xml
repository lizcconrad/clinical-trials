      The objective of this study is to determine the repeatability and reproducibility of the
      Cirrus HD-OCT measurement of illumination areas under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

      This is a prospective, single site study. Ocular history and examination will be conducted on
      consented subjects to determine further participation in the study. The study will be divided
      into two phases. In Phase 1, the inter-device variability of Cirrus HD-OCT measurements of
      illumination areas under the RPE will be determined. In Phase 2, the inter-operator
      variability of Cirrus HD-OCT measurements of illumination areas under the RPE will be
      determined. In each of these phases, the Macular Cube 200 x 200 scan and the Macular Cube 512
      x 128 scan will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females 50 years of age and older diagnosed to have advanced dry AMD with
             geographic atrophy.

          -  Geographic atrophy lesions should:

               -  Not be greater than 5 mm at the widest diameter. The entire lesion(s) should fit
                  into the 6x6 mm scan area of the Cirrus HD-OCT.

               -  Not be smaller than 1.25 mm2.

               -  Not be confluent with peri-papillary atrophy.

               -  Not be combined with other lesions such as CNV.

          -  Able and willing to make the required study visits.

          -  Able and willing to give consent and follow study instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of retinal surgery, laser photocoagulation, and/or radiation therapy to the
             eye.

          -  Evidence of other retinal diseases of the eye, including wet AMD, diabetic
             retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, or significant vitreomacular traction.

          -  Thick media opacity or inability to fixate that precludes obtaining acceptable scans.

          -  Concomitant use of hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.

          -  Unable to make the required study visits.

          -  Unable to give consent or follow study instructions.
