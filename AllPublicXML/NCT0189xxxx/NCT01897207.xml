  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this trial is to assess the response rate, the feasibility and toxicity of
      the treatment with antigen loaded Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Prostate Cancer patients.
      Furthermore we want to investigate biological responses by measuring markers of in-vivo and
      ex-vivo immunomodulation.

      Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is a promising approach to augment tumor
      antigen-specific T cell responses in cancer patients. However, tumor escape with
      down-regulation or complete loss of target antigens may limit the susceptibility of tumor
      cells to the immune attack. Concomitant generation of T cell responses against several
      immunodominant antigens may circumvent this potential drawback. In this phase I/II clinical
      trial, the investigators determined the immunostimulatory capacity of autologous DC pulsed
      with multiple T cell epitopes derived from four different prostate-specific antigens in
      patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Autologous DC of
      HLA-A*0201-positive patients are loaded with antigenic peptides derived from prostate stem
      cell antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, prostate-specific membrane antigen, and
      prostate-specific antigen. A strict quality control concerning the expression of surface
      markers and the migratory capacity of the DC secured optimal stimulatory capacity. DC were
      applied intradermally six times at biweekly intervals followed by monthly booster injections.
      Tolerability and PSA response will be investigated. Antigen-specific immune responses will be
      quantified.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologically or cytologically proven prostatic carcinoma

          -  proven hormonal resistance: tumor progression after orchiectomy or during treatment
             with hormonal agents. Patients treated with antiandrogens, such as flutamide
             (Flucinom) or bicalutamide (Casodex), should have been discontinued the drug 6 weeks
             prior to the trial entry followed by no tumor response within this 6 weeks

          -  not amenable to curative therapy

          -  patients with measurable and non-measurable disease may be included. Bone lesions only
             are considered to be non-measurable

          -  two consecutive increases of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be documented over

             minimum of one week from the reference value and be confirmed (N째3). If this value is
             less than the previous value, the patient is still eligible if the next PSA(N째4) is
