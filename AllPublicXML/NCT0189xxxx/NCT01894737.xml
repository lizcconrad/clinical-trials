  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of creatine supplementation on
      muscle mass loss during short-term immobilisation in healthy, young people.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seven days of one-legged knee immobilisation in young subjects with creatine or Placebo
      supplementation. A randomly selected leg is immobilized for seven days. Muscle mass and
      strength will be determined and muscle biopsies will be collected before and immediately
      after immobilisation. A week after the cast is removed we will assess any differences in
      recovery between intervention groups.
