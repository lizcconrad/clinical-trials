      This study is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability
      and preliminary efficacy of an MI-based program for weight loss in young adults. Participants
      will be assigned to either the MI Behavioral Weigh Loss or Behavioral Weight Loss arms - both
      arms will receive a 12-week Behavioral Weight Loss program, including 2 individual in-person
      sessions, followed by weekly Behavioral Weight Loss modules, reporting of key behaviors, and
      feedback on progress relative to goals, all via email. Session content will be quite distinct
      between the two arms, with an increased emphasis on personalized feedback relative to healthy
      norms, enhancing autonomous motivation, and choice surrounding diet and activity goals in the
      MIBWL arm. Assessments will take place at 0, and 3 months, followed by exit interviews to
      help refine the protocol.

    <description>Primary Aims Include:
Primary Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of an MI-based approach to weight loss in young adults. Specifically, to demonstrate that we can: 1) recruit 18-25 year olds into the proposed program, 2) keep them engaged, as evidenced by achieving &gt;80% attendance and &gt;80% completion of tracking / reporting activities, and 3) retain them for assessments, as evidence by achieving &gt;80% retention at 12 and 24 week visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Aim 2: To explore whether the MIBWL arm produces better adherence (see Aim 1, item 2), retention, autonomous motivation, and satisfaction, all of which may be related to better weight losses in the long-term.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To explore whether the MIBWL arm is a viable approach to weight loss in this age group. Specifically, within group, we will examine mean weight change and proportion of participants achieving a clinically significant weight loss (&gt;5%). Although not powered to detect differences, we will also explore differences in mean weight change between the MIBWL and BBWL groups.</description>
