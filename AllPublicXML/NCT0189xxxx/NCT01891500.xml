  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators in this study are concerned about the harmful effects of oxygen exposure in
      newborn infants, particularly at high concentrations. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is an FDA
      approved drug for the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) in term and late-preterm
      babies greater than 34 weeks gestation. Hypoxic respiratory failure occurs when a patient's
      lungs cannot get enough oxygen into their bloodstream. This condition is traditionally
      treated with high concentrations of oxygen and most often requires the patient be placed on a
      ventilator (breathing machine). The administration of inhaled nitric oxygen directly into the
      lungs often improves blood oxygen levels and allows caretakers to reduce the amount of oxygen
      given to the baby. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate if giving the inhaled
      nitric oxide earlier in the course of disease improves the effectiveness of the drug, reduces
      the amount of cellular injury from oxygen exposure, and decreases the total amount of time a
      patient requires supplemental oxygen. This study uses an FDA approved drug in a new manner.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers of oxidative injury.</measure>
    <time_frame>Urine samples will be collected upon enrollment and then at specific time points within the first 48 hours of study intervention to compare the change in biomarker concentrations from baseline up to hour 48.</time_frame>
    <description>Early administration of iNO to infants with HRF will result in reduced hyperoxia-mediated oxidative injury as measured by known biomarkers of oxygen free radical injury, including malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responsiveness to study treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Arterial oxygen concentration will be measured upon enrollment and at specific time points in the first 36 hours of study intervention to compare the change in arterial oxygen concentration from baseline up to hour 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Earlier administration of iNO to infants with HRF/PPHN (persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn) will lessen reactive oxygen species formation resulting in improved responsiveness to the drug as measured by the initial changes in arterial oxygen concentration after administration of the drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expression of endothelin-1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Concentration of endothelin-1 will be measured upon enrollment and at specific time points in the first 36 hours of study intervention to compare the change in concentration from baseline up to hour 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Earlier treatment with iNO may potentiate pulmonary vasodilation by modulating endothelin-1 expression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Markers of inflammation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Concentrations of pro and anti-inflammatory markers will be measured upon enrollment and at specific time points in the first 36 hours of study intervention to compare the change in concentrations from baseline up to hour 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Early iNO may up-regulate production of endogenous anti-inflammatory eicosanoids such as PGE2 (prostaglandin E2). Additionally, avoidance of hyperoxia in these patients may mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokines known to potentiate lung injury.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of oxygen treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of their hospital stay, with an expected average stay of 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Early administration of iNO to infants with HRF will result in at least a 15% reduction in total days of oxygen therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor).</measure>
    <time_frame>Concentration of VEGF will be measured upon enrollment and at specific time points in the first 36 hours of study intervention to compare the change in concentration from baseline up to hour 36.</time_frame>
