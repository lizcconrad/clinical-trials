  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal anesthesia is commonly employed in pediatrics to produce postoperative analgesia in
      low abdominal or urologic surgery.

      An exact understanding of the anatomy of the sacral area including sacral hiatus and
      surrounding structures is crucial to the success of caudal block.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the anatomy of the caudal space in pediatrics by
      ultrasound evaluation.

    <measure>ultrasound evaluation of caudal space</measure>
    <time_frame>Right after induction of general anesthesia, the patients were placed in the lateral position. The ultrasound evaluation include transverse and longitudinal view.</time_frame>
    <description>First, investigators place the transducer at the sacral cornua to obtain a transverse view.
In the transverse view, the distance between two cornua and the depth of caudal space at the sacral hiatus were measured. In the longitudinal view, the distance from the skin to the sacrococcygeal membrane and the optimal angles and the safety distance for needle insertion depending on the points of insertions were measured. From the end of dura sac to the sacral hiatus were regarded as safety distance for the needle insertion during caudal block.</description>
