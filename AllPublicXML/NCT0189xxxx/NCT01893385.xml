      The main objective is to assess the variation in plasma levels of cathelicidin before and
      after influenza vaccination.

      All bibliographic data suggests that supplementation vitamin D in the elderly often deficient
      in this vitamin may have a double interest:

        -  By induction of cathelicidin, assist in anti-infective response in particular to the
           influenza virus

        -  The normalization of vitamin D status, promote the return to an appropriate immune
           response limiting excess inflammation and improving capacity to respond.

      The entire project will collect new information on the merits of the use of vitamin D in
      aging. A better knowledge of mechanisms involved and the impact of aging on them is a
      necessary prerequisite the definition of a new strategy using this drug in the elderly
      particularly fragile in order to improve its autonomy. This definition seems a sociological
      interest obvious economic knowing the current aging population and its impact future of our
      health system.

      CONDUCT OF THE STUDY:

      Visit 1: selection of subjects (CPC / CIC-Inserm CIC501)

           written consent,

           examination, measurement of current weight, BMI, waist circumference measurement.

        -  Food Survey.

        -  Fasting blood sampling: for dosing of vitamin D, cathelicidin, exploration of
           immunocompetent cells, calcium, phosphorus, urea and creatinine.

      Visit 2: randomization (CPC / CIC-Inserm CIC501)

           phosphorus, urea and creatinine.

        -  Exploration of immune cells in patients deficient in vitamin D (molecular and cellular
           analyzes).

      Start of vitamin D supplementation or placebo

        -  Subjects with vitamin D levels &lt;30ng/mL will be randomized into two groups:

             -  Arm receiving vitamin D (BS).

      For the VitD group: dose adjustment according to the following scheme:

        -  If [25(OH) D]&gt; 75 ng / ml and / or calcium levels&gt; 106 mg / ml and / or calcium
           excretion&gt; 300 mg / l: presentation of two bulbs placebo.

        -  If [25(OH) D] &lt;75 ng / ml and serum calcium &lt;106 mg / ml and calcium excretion &lt;300 mg /
           l: presentation of two ampoules of Vitamin D. Visit 5 - Month 3 vaccination INTANZA 15 ®
           (3 months after the start of supplementation)

        -  Recovery of boxes and empty ampoules of vitamin D.

        -  Evaluation of the clinical safety of vitamin D.

        -  Collection of anthropometric data: measurement of current weight and BMI,

        -  Fasting blood sampling: for dosing of vitamin D, cathelicidin, exploration of
           immunocompetent cells, calcium, phosphorus, urea and creatinine.

        -  Influenza serology, Visit 6 - Month 4: end of study

        -  Clinical examination with assessment of tolerability of vaccination and delivery of the
           form of reporting due to immunization and infectious complications side effects
           according to the criteria of toxicity CTCNCI Bethesda,

        -  Collection of anthropometric data: measurement of current weight, calculating the weight
           change,

        -  Fasting blood sampling: for dosing of vitamin D, cathelicidin, exploration of
           immunocompetent cells, calcium, phosphorus, urea and creatinine.

        -  Measurement of seroconversion, seroprotection, MGT antibodies following vaccination.

      End of the study Removal of anonymity for physician investigators to propose a vitamin D the
      subjects who received placebo.
