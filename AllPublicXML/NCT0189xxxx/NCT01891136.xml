    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) would desensitize or tolerize
      peanut allergic patients to peanuts in order prevent peanut allergic reactions.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to develop peanut OIT for patients with peanut allergic
      reactions. This approach is designed to utilize our extensive knowledge of the allergens
      involved in peanut hypersensitivity to devise an immunotherapeutic approach that would lower
      the risk of anaphylactic reactions and would down regulate peanut-specific T cells in
      peanut-allergic patients. Previous attempts to utilize peanut-specific immunotherapy (IT)
      have been unsuccessful primarily because of the side effects of therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between 1 and 16 years of age

          -  Diagnosed peanut allergy by either: 1) a positive prick skin test to peanut, CAP FEIA
             of 15 or greater and a history of significant clinical symptoms within one hour after
             ingestion of peanuts or 2) a positive prick skin test to peanut, CAP FEIA of â‰¥ 7 and a
             history of a clinical reaction to peanut ingestion within the past 6 months.

          -  A family that will be able to be compliant with all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of severe anaphylaxis to peanut

          -  Subjects with a medical history that would prevent a DBPCFC/OFC to peanut The medical
             history that would prevent the DBPCFC to peanut would be a prior history of an open
             peanut challenge in which the patient experienced hypotension which required fluid
             resuscitation, respiratory compromise which necessitated ventilatory support, or
             poorly controlled asthma as evidenced by an forced expiratory volume in 1 second
             (FEV1) &lt; 80% of predicted, or FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) &lt; 75%, with or without
             controller medications

          -  Subjects unable to cooperate with challenge procedures or unable to be reached by
             telephone for follow-up

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Allergy to oat
