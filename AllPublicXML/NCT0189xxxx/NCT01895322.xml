      To investigate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of OPC-41061 in
      patients with chronic renal failure who are undergoing peritoneal dialysis, using daily urine
      volume, body weight, and edematous conditions as parameters and conducting dose escalation
      every 2 days until reaching the dose that achieves urine volume increase and then performing
      5-day repeated administration at the fixed dose, the final dose used in the dose escalation
      period.
