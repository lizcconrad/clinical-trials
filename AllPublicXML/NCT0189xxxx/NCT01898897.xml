      The study hypothesis is that regional anesthesia offers better outcome for the patients who
      underwent robot assisted laparoscopic urogenital surgery.

    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effect of combined anesthesia on occurrence of acute kidney injury
      in robot assisted laparoscopic urogenital surgery.Renal function is assessed according to the
      new RIFLE and AKIN criteria, and by determining serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase
      associated lipocalin.

    <description>Acute kidney injury, previously referred as acute renal failure is a serious complication of major surgery. The diagnostic of subclinical alteration of kidney function is possible with the novel biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL). Modified NGAL values can be detected in patients urine and serum at 6 hours from the renal injury.
In our study, we assessed the renal function by determining basal creatinine and follow the creatinine values 4 days postoperative. Acute kidney injury (AKI)is defined as a 0.3 mg/ml rise in serum creatinine from baseline, according to the AKIN criteria.
NGAL is measured (with ELISA technique) at 6 hours and 12 hours from the induction of the anesthesia.
The incidence of AKI will be compared in the different anesthesia techniques for robot assisted urogenital laparoscopic surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>postoperative outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>We study the effect of combined anesthesia (general anesthesia with epidural anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for 12 hours)on the postoperative outcome of patients who underwent robot assisted laparoscopic surgery. The endpoints that are discussed are perioperative morbidity, postoperative rehabilitation and the modification of host immune response to surgery.
Postoperative rehabilitation is assessed by quality of recovery score (QoR-40). The modification of immune response is assessed by determining IL6, IL10 and TNFalfa levels.
Post-prostatectomy increase in PSA (prostate specific antigen)indicates biochemic cancer recurrence.</description>

    <description>General anesthesia for robot assisted laparoscopic urogenital surgery includes premedication with alprazolam (0.5 mg per os), induction with sufentanil, propofol (1-2 mg/kg), neuromuscular blocking agents (rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg) to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia is maintained with volatile agents (sevoflurane, desflurane) and reinjection of rocuronium and sufentanil as needed.
Robotic assisted laparoscopic interventions are realised with Da Vinci surgical robot, known to assure a minimally invasive approach with good results in urologic surgery. The system consists of an ergonomic surgeon console, a patient cart with four interactive robotic arms, a 3D high resolution visualization interface and specific EndoWrist articulated tools.</description>

    <description>Combined anesthesia is defined as association of epidural analgesia to general anesthesia. Epidural catheter is inserted at low thoracic level in the operation theatre before the induction of anesthesia. Correct position is verified with 15 mg bupivacaine plain 0.5%. Infusion is started after the incision at a rate of 6-8 ml/ hour.Epidural continuous infusion of local anesthetic is maintained 12 hours postoperative in the postoperative anesthesia care unit.</description>

    <description>A catheter is placed in the epidural space at thoracic level. Analgesia is realised with local anesthetics (Bupivacaine plain 0.125%), administered from the beginning of surgical intervention and 12 hours postoperative on the postoperative care unit and intensive care unit at a rate of 6-8 ml/hour.</description>
