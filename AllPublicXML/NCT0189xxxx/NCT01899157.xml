      A prospective cross-sectional study evaluates nutritional status and its relationship to the
      related factors in Thai HIV-infected patients who attending in out patient clinic at The Thai
      Red Cross AIDS Research Centre, Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute, Surat Thani
      hospital, Khonkaen hospital, Sanpathong hospital and the Queen Savang Vadhana Hospital at Sri
      Racha .

      General Objective: To determine nutritional status among Thai People Living with HIV (PLHIV).

      Specific Objective:

        1. To assess nutritional problems including undernutrition, overnutrition and others such
           as lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular disease, etc. among naïve
           HIV-infected patients and HIV-infected patients undergoing HARRT by using ABCDEF
           approach: Anthropometric, Biochemical, Clinical, Dietary, Exercise and Family
           assessment.

        2. To describe the relationship between the nutritional status and HIV disease staging and
           other related factors among naïve HIV-infected patients and HIV-infected patients
           undergoing HARRT.

        3. To describe the prevalence of CVD and its relationship to cardiac risk factors

        4. To validate the community screening tool developed by the Thai Nutrition Taskforce in
           HIV (TNT-HIV) by assessing the correlation of this tool and nutritional status.
