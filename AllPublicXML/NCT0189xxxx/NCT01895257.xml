  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomised phase III trial evaluating a maintenance
      strategy comparing hepatic arterial injection of Yttrium-90 resin microspheres plus
      continuing simplified chemotherapy with/without targeted therapy versus continuing simplified
      chemotherapy with/without targeted therapy alone for patient with dominant or exclusive and
      unresectable liver mCRC controlled after 3-6 months of chemotherapy induction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether an intensified maintenance treatment of SIRT +
      simplified maintenance chemotherapy has a benefit in terms of time to progression (TTP)
      compared to simplified chemotherapy maintenance alone, in patients with stable disease after
      3-6 months induction therapy. We would like to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this
      approach and to investigate if this strategy has the potential to increase the outcome of the
      patient.

      Primary end-point:

      - Time to first progression (TTP1 overall)

      Secondary end-points:

        -  Time to global progression (TTP1 + TTP2), Time to second progression (TTP2), TTP1 liver
           only

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)

        -  Overall Survival (OS)

        -  Safety

        -  Ro resection rate

        -  Quality of Life

      Exploratory analysis:

      - Prediction and evaluation of SIR-spheres treatment response (only for Belgian centres)

             3 to 6 months.

          4. Trial inclusion must be performed between 3 and 6 months since the date of the first
             course of chemotherapy (induction) administration.

          5. Limited extra-hepatic metastases in the lung and/or lymph nodes are permitted.
             Metastases in the lung must either be not more than five nodules in number with no
             individual nodule more than 1 cm in diameter or 1 single lesion of up to 1.7 cm in
             diameter. Involvement of lymph nodes in 1 single anatomic region (pelvis, abdomen or
             chest) are permitted provided their longest diameter measures less than 2 cm.

          6. All imaging evidence used as part of the screening process must be within 28 days
             prior to the time of randomisation.

          7. Suitable for either treatment regimen as determined by clinical assessment undertaken

          8. Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy or (neo-) adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy
             to the pelvis, provided the last dose of chemotherapy was administered at least 6
             months prior to begin chemotherapy induction. Previous radiotherapy to the pelvis is
             not an exclusion criterion.

          9. WHO performance status 0 - 1

         10. Adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function as follows:

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Evidence of ascites, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, main portal venous tumour
             involvement or thrombosis as determined by clinical or radiological assessment.

          2. More than 6 months since last chemotherapy administration before trial inclusion.

          3. Previous radiotherapy delivered to the upper abdomen.

          4. Non-malignant disease that would render the patient unsuitable for treatment according
             to this protocol.

          5. Prior major liver resection: remnant liver &lt; 50% of the initial liver volume. Patient

             chemotherapy.

         10. Pregnant or breast feeding.

         11. Concurrent or prior history of cancer other than adequately treated non melanoma skin
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

             during the study.
