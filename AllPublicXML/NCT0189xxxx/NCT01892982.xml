  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' goal is to optimize the developmental outcomes of preterm infants by
      preventing depression and improving functioning among their mothers during the critical first
      year of life. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial of a replicable,
      lay-delivered intervention - the basic approach of which is to use an empirically-supported,
      cognitive behavioral strategy to help mothers solve their unique daily problems and address
      some of the predictable challenges to parenting a preterm infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are born at biological risk for poor health and developmental outcomes; and
      those born to low-income families face additional social risks known to further interfere
      with healthy child development. In its 2006 report, Preterm Birth, the Institute of Medicine
      (IOM) stated the public health importance of optimizing the developmental outcomes of preterm
      infants, and specifically called for novel postnatal intervention strategies to accomplish
      this goal. Our proposed strategy is based on the premise that preventing maternal depression
      - and optimizing maternal functioning in specific domains that mediate the relationship
      between maternal depression and adverse child effects - will ultimately improve the
      developmental outcomes of this vulnerable child population.

      Problem Solving Education (PSE) is a cognitive behavioral strategy that aims to impart
      recipients with skills to reduce the impact of stress on personal functioning, and thereby
      prevent depression. The present project is a randomized trial of a 6-session intervention
      based on PSE. the investigators aim to enroll 325 mother-infant dyads in four NICUs - Boston
      Medical Center, Tufts Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and
      Womens Hospital. Over 12-months of follow-up, the investigators will assess the effects of
      PSE on a series of outcome measures for mothers, a series of measures that represent risk
      mechanisms by which maternal depression is theorized to impact young children, and a series
      of child functioning measures.

        1. Primary aims. Regarding outcomes for mothers, the investigators aim to:

             1. Decrease the incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) and improve depressive
                symptom trajectories during the first postpartum year; and

             2. Improve general and parental functioning, as measured by valid and reliable scales.

        2. Secondary aims. Regarding risk mechanisms and child outcomes, the investigators aim to:

             1. Improve mothers' sense of mastery, and decrease their caregiver burden and social
                isolation;

             2. Improve adherence to evidence-based quality indicators for NICU follow-up care;

             3. Improve maternal sensitivity and mother-child interaction patterns; and

             4. Improve infant social engagement, emotionality, and cognitive functioning.

        3. Exploratory aims. the investigators will explore the role of a brief set of potential
           intervention moderators:

             1. On the infant level: severity of infant illness.

             2. On the maternal and family level: maternal trauma history, extended family
                functioning, and intervention adherence.

    <measure>Incidence of major depressive episode and depressive symptom trajectories</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>To measure depression and depressive symptom trajectories, we will combine a dimensional measure (the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms - QIDS) with the diagnostic Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). Administering the QIDS every other month during this time frame will allow us to follow depression symptom trajectories with a repeated measure sensitive to change with treatment. Administering the SCID at 12-months will allow us to determine timing and severity of major depressive episode(s).</description>

    <description>General functioning will be measured by the mean total SAS-SR score, and mean scores for the family, partner, and social SAS subscales. The SAS will be administered at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.</description>

    <description>The Coping Health Inventory for Parents is a valid and reliable instrument designed to measure parents' response to managing family life when they have an ill child. It will be administered together with the Pearlin Mastery Scale and the Medical Outcomes Survey Social Support Scale.
