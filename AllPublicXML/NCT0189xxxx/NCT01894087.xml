  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintentional poisoning is a developing public health problem in the U.S. Unintentional
      poisoning (or &quot;overdose&quot;) deaths increased 157% among adults between 1999 and 2008. There
      were ~700,000 emergency department (ED) visits due to overdoses in 2007. Medication-related
      overdoses, particularly prescription opioid overdoses, have accounted for much of this
      increase. There have been parallel increases in sales of opioids (with a 6 fold increase
      between 1997 and 2007), as well as both medical and non-medical use of prescription opioids.
      Prescription opioids are now among the most common of drugs used non-medically in the U.S.

      The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop an ED-based tailored brief prescription
      opioid overdose prevention intervention. We will examine therapeutic alliance, perceived
      satisfaction, and perceived utility of the intervention; 2) Examine intervention effects on
      precursors of overdose risk behavioral change immediately post-intervention. We will compare
      intervention and control participants on knowledge, self-efficacy, readiness to change, and
      behavioral intentions regarding overdose risk behavior; and 3) Examine intervention effects
      on overdose risk behaviors six months post-intervention. We will compare intervention and
      control participants on: 1) use of high dose/quantity of opioids; 2) using opioids in
      combinations with certain psychoactive substances (i.e., alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and
      sedatives); and, 3) route of administration.

    <measure>Overdose Risk Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a total sum of 9 items assessing participant's self-report of engaging in behavior that increases risk for overdose. Higher scores indicate greater risk for overdose. The range for this measure is 0 to 28 in one assessment. Results reported here as group means are for the change in sum score between baseline and follow-up, which had a possible range of -28 to 28, with lower values indicating greater decreases in overdose risk behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overdose Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Overdose symptom knowledge was assessed using an inventory of 5 true symptoms and 2 false symptoms of overdose, and the total score created as the sum of correct answers, with a range of 0 to 7. Due to the skewed distribution, this total score was standardized by subtracting the observed responses from the overall sample mean, and then dividing by the standard deviation. This resulted in a range of -5.4 to 2.6 in this sample at the 6 month follow-up, with higher numbers indicating greater overdose symptom knowledge. Also reported here are change scores generated by subtracting the standardized sum score at 6 months from the baseline standardized sum score, which had a range of -3.0 to 6.4 in this sample. Thus, higher numbers in this &quot;change&quot; variable indicated greater improvements in overdose symptom knowledge. Negative numbers would represent a decrease in symptom knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Intentions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral intentions were assessed with three items that measured participant's intention to use overdose risk reduction strategies. The three strategies were (1) using opioids as prescribed, (2) reducing or avoiding use of alcohol, drugs, or non-prescribed medications, and (3) avoiding combining substances. Each item was assessed on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating greater intention to avoid overdose risk.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance Use - Current Opioid Misuse Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This measure contained 8 items from the Current Opioid Misuse Measure. Items were assessed on a scale of &quot;never (0),&quot; &quot;rarely (1),&quot; &quot;sometimes (3),&quot; &quot;often (4),&quot; and &quot;very often (5).&quot; A sum score took a range of 0 to 40, with higher numbers indicating more non-medical opioid use. For group means reported here, change scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline level of this measure from the level at 6 months follow-up. This change score has a possible range of -40 to 40, with lower values indicating greater decreases in non-medical opioid use.</description>

        <title>Overdose Risk Behavior</title>
        <description>This scale is a total sum of 9 items assessing participant's self-report of engaging in behavior that increases risk for overdose. Higher scores indicate greater risk for overdose. The range for this measure is 0 to 28 in one assessment. Results reported here as group means are for the change in sum score between baseline and follow-up, which had a possible range of -28 to 28, with lower values indicating greater decreases in overdose risk behavior.</description>

        <title>Overdose Knowledge</title>
        <description>Overdose symptom knowledge was assessed using an inventory of 5 true symptoms and 2 false symptoms of overdose, and the total score created as the sum of correct answers, with a range of 0 to 7. Due to the skewed distribution, this total score was standardized by subtracting the observed responses from the overall sample mean, and then dividing by the standard deviation. This resulted in a range of -5.4 to 2.6 in this sample at the 6 month follow-up, with higher numbers indicating greater overdose symptom knowledge. Also reported here are change scores generated by subtracting the standardized sum score at 6 months from the baseline standardized sum score, which had a range of -3.0 to 6.4 in this sample. Thus, higher numbers in this “change” variable indicated greater improvements in overdose symptom knowledge. Negative numbers would represent a decrease in symptom knowledge.</description>

          <description>This measure contained 8 items from the Current Opioid Misuse Measure. Items were assessed on a scale of “never (0),” “rarely (1),” “sometimes (3),” “often (4),” and “very often (5).&quot; A sum score took a range of 0 to 40, with higher numbers indicating more non-medical opioid use. For group means reported here, change scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline level of this measure from the level at 6 months follow-up. This change score has a possible range of -40 to 40, with lower values indicating greater decreases in non-medical opioid use.</description>

          <title>Therapist-led Brief Intervention With Enhanced Usual Care</title>
          <description>Participants will receive a therapist-led, computer-assisted intervention session with a master's level therapist. The interventions are designed to address extramedical prescription opioid use and overdose risk behaviors. This includes a review of the participants' strengths, values, and goals; feedback regarding their opioid use and overdose risk behaviors; developing a discrepancy between their opioid and other drug use and ability to meet goals and values; and the formulation of a &quot;change plan&quot; for each participant. Participants in this condition also received the brochures given for the Enhanced Usual Care protocol.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Enhanced Usual Care Only</title>
          <description>For Enhanced Usual Care (EUC), therapists provided two brochures: (1) an overdose prevention and response brochure, and (2) a resource brochure. The overdose prevention and response brochure included a definition of overdose, signs and symptoms, risk factors, and bystander response to overdose. The resource brochure contained information on drug,mental health and alcohol treatment, mutual help groups, local resources for obtaining naloxone, free health clinics in the area, and a suicide prevention hotline.</description>
