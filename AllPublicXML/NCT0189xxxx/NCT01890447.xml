  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish an effective method to inform parents or close relatives of
      newborns about the risk of pertussis transmission to newborns and the advantages offered by
      the cocooning strategy (vaccinating those who are in close contact with the newborn) by
      assessing the factors that affect the parents' decision-making to accept pertussis
      immunisation.

      Two phases are foreseen in the study. The 'questionnaire design' phase will be conducted in
      order to finalise the electronic questionnaire. The enrollment phase will involve the
      administration of the final web-based questionnaires to the subjects included in the
      enrollment phase.

      The data generated in this study will be useful to inform parents of newborns about the
      advantages of vaccinating people who are in close contact with the newborn even before the
      baby is born in order to prevent the transmission of pertussis to the newborn.

      No vaccine will be administered during this study.

    <description>Data collection will be done via web-based questionnaires generated by Sawtooth Software. Subjects will be asked for their ideal alternative (acceptance to immunisation) by selecting the factors that suit them the most. The subjects are then presented several sets of alternatives built around their ideal choice.</description>
