    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study to determine if a combination of
      desensitization and enrollment in a regional kidney paired donor (KPD) exchange program
      improves the overall rate of kidney transplantation in sensitized patients.

        size, or other mismatch by their respective transplant center; or

        Group 3: be listed on the deceased donor waiting list for ≥ one year without an
        identifiable living donor and have a PRA% ≥ 60%

        B. Potential Living Donors must meet the following inclusion criteria:

             Consent Requirements Section of the KPD Program Manual of Operations

               1. Do not meet selection criteria of the transplant center

               2. Eligible compatible donor at the time of enrollment

               3. Inactive (not eligible to receive a kidney) on the deceased donor waitlist

               4. Pregnant or breast feeding

        D. Donors

          1. Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent

          2. Have identified barriers to donation as set forth in the Living Donor Evaluation
             Section of the KPD Program Manual of Operations (Appendix A)

          3. Must not be currently listed as a potential living donor for any other recipient
             registered in the KPD system

          4. Pregnant or breast feeding
