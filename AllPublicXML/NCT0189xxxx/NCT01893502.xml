  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation improves mortality, even in patients with existing smoking-related
      morbidity. Telephone follow-up after smoking cessation counselling as been shown to be an
      important method to provide support to smokers and to improve quit rates, especially if three
      or more calls were used in addition to face-to-face counselling. While it is reasonable to
      assume that more counselling leads to better smoking cessation outcomes, little evidence
      exists over the amount of telephone follow-up counselling that is required for optimal and
      sustained abstinence. We aim to investigate if six-months of weekly telephone follow-up is
      superior to one-month of weekly telephone follow-up.

          -  Subjects who are currently using smoking cessation medications

          -  Subjects who cannot be followed up for at least six months, for instance, subjects who
