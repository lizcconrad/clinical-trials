  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the overall effects of incentives on physical activity
      among older taxi drivers, and whether mental accounting exists in this context.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the 4-month Randomized Controlled Trial, participating taxi drivers will be
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups where they will receive either cash or taxi rental credits for
      meeting specified monthly step goals measured via a step counter. Subsequently, for an
      additional 3 months, drivers will be incentivized to wear step counters to test if effects of
      the rewards are sustained once the reward is no longer in place. Effects will be quantified
      in terms of step activity; and in terms of changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), Resting Heart
      Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), self-reported General Health, Health-Related Quality of Life
      (HR-QOL) and work productivity.

    <description>After the 4-month RCT, drivers will be incentivized to wear the step counter for another 3 months (i.e. Months 5 to 7) to test if effects of the rewards are sustained once the reward is no longer in place. For wearing their step counter and providing their step data, drivers will receive a modest cash incentive (amounting to SGD10) each month as well as the chance to win 1 of 3 cash prizes valued at SGD500.</description>
