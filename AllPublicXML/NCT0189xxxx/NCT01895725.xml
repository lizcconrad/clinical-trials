  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a prospective observational, single-center cohort study aimed to
      examine the progression of atherosclerotic alterations of the carotid arteries (IMT, plaque
      volume) during a follow-up of up to four years and to correlate the observed changes with
      traditional and novel biomarkers of atherosclerosis. A total of 600 subsequent patients with
      or established cardiovascular disease or at least one cardiovascular risk will be tested with
      a high-frequency ultrasound probe equipped with automated IMT measurements and 3D
      quantitative plaque volumetry. Plasma samples will be collected and tested for traditional
      and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Both ultrasound examinations and blood sampling will
      be repeated once per year to assess changes in these parameters over time depending on
      treatment modalities, which are left to the discretion of the treating physicians. The
      primary endpoint of the planned study will be the correlation between P-selectin and the
      progression of atherosclerosis as measured by plaque volume and IMT in the carotid and
      femoral arteries, respectively. Secondary endpoints will include the correlation of
      established (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and novel risk factors (hsCRP,
      P-selectin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1
      (ICAM-1), CETP TaqIb polymorphism) with the progression of atherosclerosis, the correlation
      of cardiovascular events with the progression of atherosclerosis and the additional
      predictive value of plaque volume and IMT compared to an established risk score (SCORE card).
