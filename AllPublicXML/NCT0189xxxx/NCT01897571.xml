  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study that is being conducted in two parts. The
      Phase 1 part (closed to accrual as of January 25, 2016) is comprised of dose escalation and
      expansion parts to establish the MTD and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) when
      tazemetostat is given BID (twice daily) orally on a continuous basis. Additionally, in
      separate cohorts in Phase 1, the effect of food on the bioavailability of tazemetostat as
      well as the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of tazemetostat are being evaluated. The
      Phase 2 part was initiated once the MTD and /or RP2D was established. Phase 2 enrolls
      subjects with DLBCL (Cohorts 1-3 and 6) and FL (Cohorts 4 and 5) for the determination of
      efficacy and safety of tazemetostat monotherapy (Cohorts 1-5) and of tazemetostat in
      combination with prednisolone (Cohort 6) with placement determined by centrally confirmed
      histology, cell of origin (COO), and EZH2 mutation status.

             daily (or equivalent corticosteroid, excluding protocol-defined prednisolone dosing
             for subjects enrolled in Cohort 6) when used for treatment of lymphoma related
             symptoms, with the intent to taper by the end of Cycle 1.

          8. Males or females aged ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent (Phase 2). Males and
             females aged ≥ 16 years at time of informed consent (Phase 1).

          9. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at screening or baseline (as documented by a
             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity
             of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before
             the first dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing
             potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic,
             in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been
             sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dose). Females of childbearing
             potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days prior to
             study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, from the
             last menstrual period prior to randomization, during Treatment Cycles, and for 30 days
             after the last final dose of study treatment, and have a male partner who uses a
             condom. Highly effective contraception includes:

               1. Double barrier methods of contraception such as condom plus diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault cap with spermicide.

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device.

               3. Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable, or implant. Females
                  who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must
                  continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after
                  study drug discontinuation.

             Female subjects exempt from this requirement are subjects who practice total
             abstinence or have a male partner who is vasectomized. If currently abstinent, the
             subject must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception as described
             above if they become sexually active during the Treatment Cycles, and for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation.

         10. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy or they and their female partner
             must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential or practicing highly
             effective contraception and use a condom throughout the study period and for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation).

         11. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

             Phase 1 only:

         12. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor or
             B-cell lymphomas that have progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for
             which there are no standard therapies available.

             Phase 2 only:

         13. Subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria:

               1. Have histologically confirmed DLBCL (including primary mediastinal B-cell
                  lymphoma), with relapsed or refractory disease following at least 2 lines of

                  anthracycline-based chemotherapy is contraindicated)/anti-CD20-based therapy
                  (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
                  [R-CHOP] or equivalent) AND must be considered unable to benefit from
                  intensification treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
                  (ASCT) as defined by meeting at least 1 of the following criteria:

                       rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin [R-DHAP])

                    -  Ineligible for intensification treatment due to age or significant
                       comorbidity

                    -  Ineligible for intensification treatment due to failure to mobilize an
                       acceptable number of hematopoietic stem cells

                    -  Refused intensification treatment and/or ASCT

                  available therapies OR have a contra-indication to their use. Subjects with prior
                  ASCT may be included.
