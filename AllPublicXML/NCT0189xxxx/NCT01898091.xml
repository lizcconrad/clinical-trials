      This study involves adults receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer and will test
      whether or not the study mouthrinse may lessen oral mucositis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad goal of our research is development of an effective Complementary and Alternative
      Medicine (CAM) approach to prevent mucositis or lessen its severity and complications. Oral
      mucositis (OM) is a clinically challenging and debilitating side effect of conventional
      radiotherapy (RT), affecting almost all patients undergoing RT for head and neck cancer. OM
      includes inflammation of the oral mucosa with or without opportunistic microbial infection.
      It ranges from mild erythema to severe ulceration accompanied by persistent pain leading to
      inability to tolerate or swallow food and fluids. OM frequently causes unwanted cancer
      treatment dose reductions or breaks in therapy. Despite use of pain medications, severe OM is
      associated with substantially increased use of costly health care resources. Presently, there
      are no effective treatments for OM. The primary aim of the current proposal is to determine
      whether or not a mouthrinse containing an herbal extract with known anti-inflammatory and
      anti-microbial medicinal properties, will reduce the severity of oral mucositis in cancer
      patients undergoing conventional radiotherapy to the head and neck. Because of the prominent
      inflammatory and microbial aspects of OM we anticipate that the herbal mouthrinse will reduce
      the severity of the pain and secondary infections associated with OM, and will improve the
      quality of life in head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT. Therefore, the specific aims
      of our Phase II double-blind, randomized, controlled trial are 1) to determine if the
      severity of oral mucositis is reduced in RT patients receiving the herbal mouthrinse compared
      to patients receiving the comparison mouthrinse and 2) to determine the effects of the herbal
      mouthrinse on the microbial environment of the oral cavity and on quality of life. Findings
      from this study will provide evidence to support more in-depth biological assessment of the
      anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial mechanisms by which the herbal extract reduces oral
      mucositis, and additional study in other populations experiencing mucositis.

    <time_frame>MTS score is collected at the baseline visit and once each week during the 7 weeks of radiation therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Severity is assessed as the maximum change in mean mouth and throat soreness (MTS) score from baseline during the weeks of RT, using MTS question of the validated Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (modified OMDQ): &quot;During the past 24 hours, how much mouth and throat soreness did you have?&quot; The MTS score is a 5-point score, ranging from 0=No soreness to 4=Extreme soreness. We compared the maximum change in MTS score between the two groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with a one-sided alpha of 0.05.</description>

    <ipd_description>After publication of the results of the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial, we will offer our collected experience to other interested clinicians/scientists. Our first priority is that any data sets that are used be subject of a confidentiality agreement. Any clinical data that is shared will be stripped of any subject personal information (de-indentified data). Our intent, if the trial results are promising is to share the findings through the HCC Clinical Trial Network. If our intervention is useful we are open to further investigation though clinical trial and other cooperative groups. Dr. Susan Reed, as PI, will participate in all sharing activities.</ipd_description>

        <title>Maximum Change in Mean Mouth and Throat Soreness (MTS) Score From Baseline Through Weeks of Radiation Therapy Using the MTS Question of the Modified Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire*.</title>
        <description>Severity is assessed as the maximum change in mean mouth and throat soreness (MTS) score from baseline during the weeks of RT, using MTS question of the validated Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (modified OMDQ): “During the past 24 hours, how much mouth and throat soreness did you have?” The MTS score is a 5-point score, ranging from 0=No soreness to 4=Extreme soreness. We compared the maximum change in MTS score between the two groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with a one-sided alpha of 0.05.</description>
        <time_frame>MTS score is collected at the baseline visit and once each week during the 7 weeks of radiation therapy.</time_frame>
