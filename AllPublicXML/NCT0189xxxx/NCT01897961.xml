  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Membranous nephropathy (GEM)idiopatic is the most frequent cause of syndrome n√©phrotique
      at the adult and represent approximately 2 % of the causes of terminal chronic renal
      insufficiency. A etiology balance assessment must be systematically realized to eliminate a
      secondary cause. Antibodies managed against the receiver of phospholipases A2 secreted by
      type M (PLA2R1) was recently detected in a population of GEM idiopatic, but not secondary
      GEM. PLA2R1 is expressed by the podocytes of the glomerules of healthy subjects, and this
      receiver co-is located with the deposits of extramembraneous IgG of the expanding subjects of
      idiopathique GEM. The good IgG the extramembraneous depositsof GEM idiopathic recognize
      PLA2R1. At some patients, the activity anti-PLA2R1 seems to decrease or to disappear during
      the stake in forgiveness of the disease.

      Some cases of second offense of GEM idiopathique after renal transplantation presenting
      antibodies anti-PLA2R1 have also described. The appearance of antibody anti-PLA2R1 seems
      parallel to the increase of a proteinurie in touch with a second offense of GEM, and
      antibodies sometimes disappeared after a therapeutic strengthening by Rituximab allowing to
      obtain a forgiveness.

      A GEM can also appear of novo on the renal transplant, it is to say without notion of GEM on
      the native loins. The physiopathology of this affection remains unknown.

      Working hypothesis and objectives We shall look in which proportion the presence of antibody
      anti-PLA2R1 is associated with the second offense of GEM idiopathic in renal transplantation.
      We anticipate that the GEM of novo of the renal transplant answers a different
      physiopathology, and will not be associated with the presence of antibody anti-PLA2R1. We
      hope to demonstrate that at the expanding patients of antibody anti-PLA2R1, the title of
      these antibodies is correlated in the activity of the disease and in the renal survival, and
      that the longitudinal follow-up of the title of these antibodies has an interest forecast and
      therapeutics.
