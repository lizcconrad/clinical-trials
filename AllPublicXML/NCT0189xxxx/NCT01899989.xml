  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of exploratory immunologic biomarkers,
      functional MRI images can serve as early predictors for response of NSCLC. It also will
      provide important information on the perceived side effects from a patient perspective.
      Patients may participate if they have tumors ≥3 cm without lymph node involvement (for which
      chemotherapy is not part of the standard of care). Patients will only receive stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) per standard dose guidelines.

    <description>Patients will receive five fractions of either 8, 10, or 12 Gy to the gross tumor only. Following SBRT patients will be evaluated by their medical oncologist for consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy, starting 6-8 weeks post-RT. All patients will be followed for one year. Patients will be assessed for toxicity by their radiation oncologist at 4 to 6 weeks post-RT and during chemotherapy by their medical oncologist. Follow up after completion of all treatment will consist of CT chest scans at 6 and 12 months post-SBRT and toxicity assessments every 3 months from the end of SBRT for one year.</description>

    <description>Using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc therapy (VMAT), the choice of which is determined by the radiation oncologist, patients will be treated in &lt; 5 fractions every other day. The total treatment dose will be between 45 and 54 Gy in &lt; 5 fractions per standard of care. All patients will be followed for one year. Patients will be assessed for toxicity by their radiation oncologist at 4 to 6 weeks post-RT and during chemotherapy at the discretion of their medical oncologist. Follow up after completion of all treatment will consist of CT chest scans at 6 and 12 months post-SBRT and toxicity assessments every 3 months from the end of SBRT for one year. FDG PET/CT scans and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) will be obtained at 3 months and 9 months after SBRT.</description>

    <description>Standard chemotherapy with a histology-selected cisplatin or carboplatin-based doublet will be administered intravenously as adjuvant therapy. Gemcitabine will be used for squamous cell carcinomas and pemetrexed will be used for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Cisplatin or carboplatin will be used in combination with the histology-selected agent. The choice of cisplatin or carboplatin will be at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.</description>
