  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of children with epilepsy have seizures that are medically intractable.
      Uncontrolled seizures pose a variety of risks to children, including higher rates of
      mortality, developmental delay and cognitive impairment. Epilepsy surgery is not a feasible
      option for most children with refractory epilepsy. The ketogenic diet and the modified Atkins
      diet have been shown to be effective alternative treatments in children with refractory
      epilepsy. However, these need parents to be educated, and understand complex instructions of
      weighing foods and diet preparation. Therefore, children with parents with low levels of
      literacy and poor socioeconomic status have not been able to benefit from these therapies.
      Also, the paucity of trained dieticians and limited availability of labeled foods in
      resource-constraint settings has made these dietary therapies even more inaccessible.

      This study aimed to to develop a simple-to-administer variation of the modified Atkins diet
      for use in children with refractory epilepsy and to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      this simplified modified Atkins diet in children with refractory epilepsy in a randomized
      controlled open-label trial.

    <description>Modified Atkins diet with the following modifications:
Pictorial representation of various food items and exchange lists will be provided.
Instead of weights, we will provide standardized measures
We will calculate the amount of carbohydrates of daily readily available foods in the standardized measures
We will formulate recipes and diets based on locally available and culturally acceptable foods.
We will develop a parent instruction manual.
We will also develop methods for parents with low levels of literacy to maintain seizure logs. This will be done by using bars and color codes.
We will develop methods for parents with low levels of literacy to measure and record urine ketones. This will be done by using color codes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 2 - 14 years.

          2. Seizures persisting daily or more than 7 per week despite the use of at least 2
             anti-epileptic drugs in appropriate doses and levels (whenever available) in suitable
             to the syndrome and EEG findings.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected inborn error of metabolism:

             Patients with clinical suspicion of metabolic disorder as evidenced by 2 or more of
             the following- a history of parental consanguinity, prior affected siblings,
             unexplained vomiting, intermittent worsening of symptoms, recurrent episodes of
             lethargy, altered sensorium, or ataxia, hepatosplenomegaly on examination With or
             without 2 or more of the following biochemical abnormalities High blood ammonia
             (&gt;80mmol/L), High arterial lactate (&gt;2 mmol/L), metabolic acidosis (pH &lt;7.2),
             hypoglycaemia (blood sugar &lt;40 mg/dl), abnormal urinary aminoacidogram, presence of
             reducing sugars or ketones in urine, and positive results on urine neurometabolic
             screening tests.

             In such patients, blood tandem mass spectrometry or urine gas chromatography mass
             spectroscopy (GCMS) will be obtained to look for inborn error of metabolism.

          2. Surgically remediable causes of epilepsy such as tumors, cortical dysplasias, mesial
             temporal lobe epilepsy etc with refractory focal epilepsy.

             We will perform MRI brain, and short term video-EEG in all patients with focal
             seizures to look for surgically remediable causes.

          3. Motivational or psychosocial issues in the family which would preclude compliance

          4. Systemic illness- chronic hepatic, renal or pulmonary disease
