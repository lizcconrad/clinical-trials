             allergies

          7. Known decompensated liver cirrhosis and active hepatitis

          8. Women with HELLP (Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelet count) syndrome
             (defined according to &quot;Dansk Selskab for Obstetrik og Gynækologi guidelines&quot;)

             patient to be unsuitable for completion of the study or place the patient at potential
             risk from being in the study. For example, a malignancy, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable ischaemic heart disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
