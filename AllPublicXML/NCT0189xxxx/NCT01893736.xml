      The investigators will conduct an early postpartum professional breastfeeding intervention to
      postpartum women who are intended to breastfeed newborn babies to improve breastfeeding
      outcomes.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether early post-partum professional breastfeeding
      support improves breastfeeding outcomes.

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. Exclusive breastfeeding rates at 1, 2, and 3 months will be increased among
           mother-infant pairs who receive professional lactation support or telephone follow-up
           support (intervention groups) when compared with those who receive usual post-natal
           breastfeeding support (control group);

        2. The rate of any breastfeeding (predominant or partial) at 1, 2, and 3 months will be
           increased among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those
           in the control group;

      The secondary hypotheses are:

        1. The overall duration of exclusive breastfeeding will be increased among mother-infant
           pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the control group;

        2. The overall duration of any breastfeeding (predominant or partial) will be increased
           among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the
           control group.

    <description>In-hospital professional lactation support will consist of two 30-minute one-to-one hands-on breastfeeding counseling sessions in first 24 hours post-partum and one further 30-minute one-to-one hands-on breastfeeding counseling session on the second day of post-partum hospitalization for a total of three 30-minute sessions. The one-to-one sessions will focus on: (1) education and advice on correct breastfeeding positions and techniques, (2) education and advice on milk supply and how to avoid common breastfeeding problems, and (3) hands-on instruction and assistance with proper breastfeeding positioning and technique, latching on and newborn attachment to the breast, and manual expression of breast milk.</description>

    <description>Postpartum telephone follow-up support will consist of telephone support 72 hours after hospital discharge and weekly for the first 4 weeks, or until weaned. Earlier telephone contacts will focus more on breastfeeding topics. Information will be solicited from the participants about problems or difficulties they are experiencing. Supportive advice will be provided regarding management of breastfeeding problems, and support and encouragement for the continuation of breastfeeding. Later contacts will focus more on advice and encouragement on breastfeeding while resuming daily activities or returning to work, nursing in public places, and expressing and storing breast milk.</description>
