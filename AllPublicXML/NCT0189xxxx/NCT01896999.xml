      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab when
      given together with brentuximab vedotin, and how well they work in treating patients with
      Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to
      previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Brentuximab vedotin is a combining
      monoclonal antibody with an anticancer drug that binds to a protein on the surface of
      lymphoma cells called cluster of differentiation (CD)30 and may kill the cells. It is not
      known whether giving brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab may kill
      more cancer cells.

The relative abundance of each taxon (phyla to genera) and functional pathways among different groups will be statistically compared in univariate analysis using t-test (or Wilcoxon test) and in multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Global diversity tests and multivariate analysis for taxonomic abundance and functional pathways will be adjusted for potential confounders (age, gender, race, and body mass index [BMI]) in the comparisons of HL patients and controls, and further adjusted for stage and grade when examining the clinical response among HL patients.</description>
