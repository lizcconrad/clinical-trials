  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of moderate to severe daily
      hot flashes 4 weeks after a single dose of erenumab (AMG 334) in women with hot flashes
      associated with menopause.

      This study will test the hypothesis that the vasodilation associated with capsaicin-induced
      dermal blood flow (DBF) provides a good model for the vasodilation associated with hot
      flashes; therefore erenumab doses that cause DBF inhibition will be safe and well tolerated,
      and will be effective in the reduction of the frequency and/or severity of HFs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  female subjects with hot flashes associated with menopause between 45 and 65 years of
             age, inclusive, with no history or evidence of clinically relevant medical disorders
             as determined by the investigator in consultation with the Amgen physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder (including psychiatric),
             condition or disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Amgen physician would
             pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or
             completion.
