  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the risk factors associated with pertussis/whopping cough
      infection among infants less than one year of age in a United States (U.S.) commercially
      insured population. The study will utilize a large research data base associated with a
      geographically diverse U.S. health plan not limited by one geographic area or disease
      outbreak to evaluate pertussis in infants between 2005 and 2010. Healthcare costs and
      utilization among infants with a reported diagnosis of pertussis/whooping cough stratified by
      the number of DTaP vaccinations received prior to infection will also be reported.

      This study will utilize the OptumInsight proprietary research database which contains
      enrollment and claims data for individuals enrolled in commercial health plans to estimate
      the measureable demographic, clinical and historical economic risk factors that may be
      associated with medically diagnosed pertussis/whooping cough infection among commercially
      insured infants less than one-year of age. Healthcare costs and utilization among infants
      with a reported diagnosis of pertussis/whooping cough will be stratified by the number of
      DTaP vaccinations received prior to infection.

    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint(s) for the primary objective are the odds ratios associated with factors modelled in a logistic regression (conditional logit model) where the outcome is the diagnosis of pertussis/whooping cough. Demographic, economic and clinical risk factors available in the administrative claims database and potentially associated with pertussis/whooping cough infection will be estimated. Covariates will be determined based on clinical rationale and statistical significance.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of health care resource utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Health care resource utilization (e.g. ambulatory visits, emergency department visits, inpatient hospitalizations, length of stay) will be calculated for infants with a reported diagnosis of pertussis/whooping cough stratified by the number of DTaP vaccinations received prior to infection.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of health care costs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Health care costs will be computed as the combined health plan and patient paid amounts in the post-index period. Costs will be calculated as a total costs, medical costs, pharmacy costs, ambulatory costs, emergency costs and other costs and split by those occurring prior to the index date and those in the follow-up period. Costs will be adjusted to 2012 U.S. dollar values using the Medical Care Consumer Price Index.</description>
