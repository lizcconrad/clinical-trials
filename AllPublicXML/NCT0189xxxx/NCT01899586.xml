  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to devise a sufficiently high intensity training program that
      provided an optimal stimulus to remove the peripheral factors known to reduce functional
      capacity, and can be cardiovascular and orthopedically well tolerated by the elderly.
      Findings from study laboratories have suggested that a regional specific training stimulus
      (RSTS) results in rapid improvements in both vascular and muscular function. RSTS is a novel
      combination of resistance training and aerobic training applied simultaneously, and in a
      serial manner, to specific regions of the body. It involves high-intensity and frequency
      muscle contractions, generating a targeted exercise stimulus, without producing excessive
      cardiovascular or orthopedic stress. The hypothesis is that initiating training with RSTS at
      multiple, strategically selected peripheral sites, in a serial manner will elicit local
      vascular and muscular changes, thereby preparing individuals at elevated risk of losing
      independence, to respond and progress more favorably to whole-body exercise.

    <measure>Change in Maximal Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Functional Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Senior Fitness Test is a previously validated battery of 6 physical tasks of daily living used to assess strength, flexibility and endurance in order to detect and predict future limitations in functional capacity. The test is designed to evaluate physical fitness domains including upper-body strength (Arm Curl), lower-body strength (Chair Sit-Stand), upper and lower body flexibility (Back Scratch and Chair Sit and Reach), balance and coordination (8 foot Up and Go), and endurance (Six Minute Walk).</description>

    <description>The RSTS protocol was designed to focus on specific peripheral muscle groups without imposing a significant cardiorespiratory strain. Each exercise involved contractions with moderate load but with an extended duration of up to six minutes. Eight specific exercises were performed to target all major muscle groups and enable the routine to be completed within 60 minutes including warm-up, rest periods and stretching between exercises, and cool down exercises.</description>
