    <textblock>
      The aim of this extension study is to explore the antibody persistence 24 to 36 months after
      the last dose of vaccine, in infants that received a two or three dose primary series plus a
      booster dose at 11 months of age, of the Novartis meningococcal B vaccine (rMenB + OMV NZ) in
      groups I to III of the parent V72_28 study.

      This study will also explore the antibody persistence 24 to 36 months after two catch-up
      doses of the Novartis meningococcal B vaccine (rMenB + OMV NZ) administered in children (2 to
      10 years old) in group IV of the parent V72_28 study.

               1. Healthy subjects from 35 to 47 months of age, (only applicable to group K) (The
                  age window is defined as the first day the subject turns 35 months of age up to
                  the day before the subject turns 48 months of age),

               2. Healthy subjects 4 to 7 years of age (only applicable to group L) (The age window
                  is defined as the first day the subject turns 4 years of age up to the day before
                  the subject turns 8 years of age).

               3. Healthy subjects 8 to 12 years of age (only applicable to group M) (The age
                  window is defined as the first day the subject turns 8 years of age up to the day
                  before the subject turns 13 years of age).

          7. Known or suspected autoimmune disease or impairment/alteration of the immune system
             resulting from (for example):

               -  Receipt of any chronic immunosuppressive therapy

               -  Receipt of any chronic immunostimulants

               -  Immune deficiency disorder, or known HIV infection

          8. History of seizure, any progressive neurological disease or Guillain Barré Syndrome
             (exception: one self-limited febrile seizure is acceptable).

             bleeding time.

         10. Subject's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are not able to comprehend and to follow all
             required study procedures for the whole period of the study.

         14. Any significant chronic infection.

         15. Any serious chronic or progressive disease according to judgment of the investigator
