  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is one of 3 anti-platelet medications used in patients with acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) to prevent further clot formation and further ischemic damage to myocardial
      tissue. Overall benefits of one drug over the other is neutral in this generally unstable
      population. In pre-clinical trials, ticagrelor showed secondary effects, involving the
      release of adenosine to heart muscle where the demand for blood was increased due to a stress
      condition. Blood flow was increased, potentially preventing potential damage.

      This study will compare ticagrelor, currently only approved for use in ACS patients, against
      clopidogrel by measuring the myocardial blood flow(MBF) during stress to validate this
      phenomenon. The effect on blood flow will be measurable by using two specific doses of
      adenosine as the pharmacologic stress and correlating with measurements of blood flow using
      positron emission tomography (PET) nuclear imaging.

      This study hypothesizes that the increase in MBF during intermediate dose adenosine infusion
      will be greater in ticagrelor treated subjects compared to clopidogrel treated subjects
