      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ketamine-induced brain activity changes are
      modulated by TAK-063 administration using neuroimaging battery tests.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-063. This study will look at brain activity
      changes and treatment of psychotic-like symptoms induced by ketamine, in people who take
      TAK-063.

      The study will enroll approximately 27 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of treatment sequences—which will remain undisclosed to the participants during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need). Participants will receive the following study
      medications by the end of the study:

        -  Ketamine intravenous infusion (IV) AND

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient AND

        -  Two doses of TAK-063 at one of three dose levels All participants will be asked to take
           3 tablets and will receive a ketamine IV on the first day of 3 separate study periods.
           Participants will then be assessed for brain activity changes and other symptoms. This
           single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
           participate in this study is up to 7 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the
           clinic.

    <description>Ketamine model was used to enhance the sensitivity to detect an effect of phosphodiesterase 10a (PDE10a) inhibition by TAK-063 by ketamine using neuroimaging battery tests. Ketamine induced robust blood oxygen level-dependent(BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) response while maintaining minimal accompanying psychotomimetic symptoms. The regions of interest include:left anterior cingulate cortex,right anterior cingulate cortex,left posterior cingulate cortex,right posterior cingulate cortex,left striatum,right striatum,left amygdala,right amygdala,left substantia nigra,right substantia nigra,left thalamus,right thalamus,left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,left hippocampus,right hippocampus,left subgenual cingulate/Ba25,right subgenual cingulate/Ba25,left paracingulate gyrus/Ba32, and right paracingulate gyrus/Ba32.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Healthy male participants were enrolled in this 3 period study and randomized in 1 of 9 administration sequences to receive TAK-063 3 mg, TAK-063 10 mg, TAK-063 30 mg and TAK-063 matching placebo. Due to predicted exposures being higher than likely clinically relevant, the dose of 300 mg was removed and replaced by 10 mg in protocol amendment 3.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Ketamine-Induced Brain Activity in Regions of Interest During Resting State</title>
        <description>Ketamine model was used to enhance the sensitivity to detect an effect of phosphodiesterase 10a (PDE10a) inhibition by TAK-063 by ketamine using neuroimaging battery tests. Ketamine induced robust blood oxygen level-dependent(BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) response while maintaining minimal accompanying psychotomimetic symptoms. The regions of interest include:left anterior cingulate cortex,right anterior cingulate cortex,left posterior cingulate cortex,right posterior cingulate cortex,left striatum,right striatum,left amygdala,right amygdala,left substantia nigra,right substantia nigra,left thalamus,right thalamus,left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,left hippocampus,right hippocampus,left subgenual cingulate/Ba25,right subgenual cingulate/Ba25,left paracingulate gyrus/Ba32, and right paracingulate gyrus/Ba32.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1: 4 hours post TAK-063 dose or placebo</time_frame>
        <population>The pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis set included all participants in the safety set and with at least 1 valid PD assessment. PD analysis set did not include 2 participants treated with TAK-063 300 mg.</population>
