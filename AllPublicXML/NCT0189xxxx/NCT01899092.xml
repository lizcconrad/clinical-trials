  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a first in man, dose escalation study that will measure the safety and efficacy
      of TT-034 in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The study is divided into 5
      dose levels. Subjects will be given a single dose delivered by IV infusion. The subjects will
      be monitored and the data analyzed. After a set time, between 6 and 10 weeks depending on the
      dose level, the next set of subjects will be dosed. The study drug is a gene therapy
      treatment that produces molecules that destroy the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected cells.
      Once the study drug is given, it cannot be withdrawn. Additionally, once an individual
      receives a dose, he or she will not be able to receive a second dose, but will remain
      eligible to receive most other HCV treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time use of a method of therapy designed to transfer anti-HCV genetic
      sequences into the hepatocytes of subjects infected with HCV. The anti-HCV sequences will be
      comprised of three different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) that have the ability to directly
      cleave the RNA genome of HCV by a process known as RNA interference. The transfer of the
      anti-HCV sequences will be accomplished using a &quot;vector&quot; that was made from an
      adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) by removing the viral genes and replacing them with a
      non-replicating genetic sequence that produces three different shRNA that target three
      different regions within the HCV genes. This type of vector has been used in other clinical
      trials in order to transduce the hepatocytes of subjects who suffer from hemophilia.
