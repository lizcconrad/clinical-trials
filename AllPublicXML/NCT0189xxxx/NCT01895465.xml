  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for treatment
      increases day by day, creating a further burden on the limited nursing staff and where many
      children and their parents are forced to wait many hours until their medical investigation
      ends. Part of the many hours waited are for various tests the patient has to undergo, where
      the urine test is one of the main ones.

      Urinary tract infections in children are a common cause of death due to acute and chronic
      complications alike. Our study aims to test a urine collection method to see whether it
      reduces parents' and/or nursing staff's involvement and thereby reducing the urine sample's
      percentage of contamination.

      The study intends to explore whether on obtaining a pediatric urine sample by using a diaper
      in an innovative way can shorten the waiting time parents have to endure until an urine
      sample is perceived, and accordingly, the percentage of contamination in the samples
      obtained. The innovativeness introduced is that by using an ordinary everyday diaper, which
      is found in all marketing outlets, and by making a slit in the diaper where the pediatric
      urine collecting bag can be pulled out and thus allowing parents/care takers to see straight
      away whether urine has been given and thus cut back on opening and reopening of the diaper.
