  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the second most frequent gastrointestinal malignancy. The overall
      survival is dismal. Especially for advanced pancreatic cancer, the conventional approaches
      are typically not curative and provide only minor increases in survivals in most cases.
      Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a pivotal role
      in the initiation, programming, and regulation of tumor-specific immune responses. Isolated
      DCs loaded with tumor antigen ex vivo and administered as a cellular vaccine have been found
      to induce protective and therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in experimental animals. Some
      clinical trials of DC vaccination for cancer patients have shown the induction of anti-tumor
      immune responses and tumor regression. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an established
      technique for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound guided
      fine-needle direct injection of dendritic cells vaccination into pancreatic tumors may be a
      promising treatment modality.Therefore, The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle injection of DCs vaccination into
      advanced pancreatic cancer
