      The overall aim of this pilot feasibility study is to determine if 12-week moderate intensity
      exercise can safely alleviate posttraumatic symptoms in premenopausal women veterans.

      Specific aims of the study are to;

        1. Determine the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of 12-week moderate intensity
           exercise

        2. Explore potential therapeutic benefits of 12-week moderate intensity exercise. Outcome
           data will include posttraumatic and depressive symptoms.

        3. Explore potential therapeutic effects of a 12-week moderate intensity exercise on
           comorbid pain syndrome and quality of life.
