  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed for patients who had malignant melanoma and, following tumor removal,
      are now free of disease, or have only very minor residual disease, and are at a very high
      risk of disease recurrence. These patients will be treated with the A2/4-1BBL melanoma
      vaccine, a compatible melanoma cell line that has been engineered to express a molecule
      termed 4-1BBL, which enhances the chances of the cell line to be recognized by the patient's
      immune system, and to induce its stimulation. The hypothesis that drives the study states
      that the immune response against the cell line will also be effective against the residual
      tumor that may still be present in the body.

On day 10, intravenous low dose cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2, will be administered at the day care unit. On day 14 the appropriate dose of irradiated M20/A2B cells will be injected into three adjacent sites on the upper arm or thigh, avoiding limbs where lymph node dissection had been previously performed. Four additional doses of the vaccine will be administered at intervals of 21 days.</description>
