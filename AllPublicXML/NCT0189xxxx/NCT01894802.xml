      The purpose of this research study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using two CRS
      Arrays (microelectrodes) for long-term recording of brain motor cortex activity and
      microstimulation of brain sensory cortex.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with tetraplegia (paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in partial
      or total loss of the use of the arms and legs) have intact brain function but are unable to
      move due to injury or disease affecting the spinal cord, nerves or muscles. Brain-machine
      interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural
      (nerve) signals are generated even though they do not reach the arms, hands and legs. By
      placing (implanting) sensors on the surface of the brain, individuals can be trained to send
      neural signals which are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then
      be used to control a variety of devices or computer displays. Using neural activity to
      control an external device is referred to as a brain-machine interface (BMI) technology. In
      addition, areas of the brain that are involved in interpreting sensations from the arms,
      hands and legs remain functional after injury. It is therefore possible to send tiny
      electrical pulses through implanted arrays to mimic sensory input that would normally come
      from the arms, hands and legs. The investigators refer to this as &quot;microstimulation.&quot;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have limited or no ability to use both hands due to cervical spinal cord
             injury, brainstem stroke or spinal stroke. Individuals with tetraplegia must have less
             than grade 4 muscle strength in elbow extension and wrist extension and less than
             grade 2 strength in finger flexor and abduction on the contralateral side to the
             implant. We will include subjects with both complete and incomplete injuries.

          2. Subjects must report that they are unable to perform functional activities with the
             hand contralateral to implantation.

          3. Subjects must be over 1 year post-injury at time of implantation. In addition, subject
             must report no worsening in neurologic status (strength, sensation) for the previous 6
             months.

          4. Subjects must be between the ages of 22-70 years old. Participants outside this age
             range may be at an increased surgical risk and increased risk of fatigue during BMI
             training.

          5. Subjects must live within 1 hour of the University of Pittsburgh during the study or
             be willing to travel to the University of Pittsburgh at least once per week for BMI
             training.

          6. If subjects do not live in the Pittsburgh area, they are expected to stay somewhere
             within 1 hour of the University of Pittsburgh for at least 18 months after enrollment.

          7. Subjects must be able to communicate with the investigators in English because of the
             need to follow the instructions of the study team.

          8. Subjects must show an understanding of the study goals and have the ability to follow
             simple directions as judged by the investigators

          9. Subjects must have results that are within normal limits on neuropsychological and
             psychosocial assessment; psychosocial health and support will be assessed by interview
             with the psychologist.

         10. Subjects must be able to activate distinct cortical areas during imagined or attempted
             movement tasks (i.e. hand movement and speaking or moving the mouth); this will be
             evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as part of screening.

         11. Subjects must have a stable psychosocial support and caregivers who are able to
             perform the necessary daily care of the participant's skin and pedestal site. This
             requires that the subject identify a caregiver and a backup who have been in place for
             greater than 6 months and are able to provide needed physical and psychosocial
             support. This will be assessed by the sponsor-investigator and study neurosurgeon.

         12. Subjects must have a life expectancy greater than 18 months as assessed by the study
             investigator and neurosurgeon sub-investigator

         13. Documentation of informed consent must be obtained from the participant or their legal
             representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Visual impairment such that extended viewing of a computer monitor would be difficult
             even with ordinary corrective lenses

          2. Another serious disease(s) or disorder(s) that could affect ability to participate in
             this study (verified during pre-op anesthesia evaluation to determine surgical risk
             status)

          3. Recent history of pressure sores that could be exacerbated by 1-2 days of bed rest

          4. Metallic implant(s) that would prohibit the subject from having an fMRI scan; spinal
             fixators are generally non-ferrous and would not exclude someone from participating in
             the study

          5. Any type of implantable generator such as a pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator,
             cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator (DBS), DBS leads, vagus nerve stimulator, or
             defibrillator

          6. Women of childbearing age who are pregnant, lactating, or plan to become pregnant
             during the next 25 months

          7. Allergy to contrast medium or kidney failure that could be exacerbated by contrast
             agent (for MRI)

          8. Subjects receiving medications (such as sedatives) chronically that may retard motor
             coordination and cognitive ability

          9. Individuals who require routine MRI, therapeutic ultrasound, or diathermy

         10. Individuals with osteomyelitis

         11. Severe skin disorder that causes excessive skin sloughing, lesions or breakdown of the
             scalp

         12. History of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest or with intractable cardiac
             arrhythmias

         13. Individuals with an implanted hydrocephalus shunt

         14. Individuals who have had a stroke caused by a surgical procedure

         15. Active infection(s) or unexplained fever (verified during pre-op anesthesia evaluation
             to determine surgical risk status)

         16. Consumption of more than 1 alcoholic beverage per day on average

         17. Receiving chronic oral or intravenous steroids or immunosuppressive therapy

         18. Active cancer within the past year (other than adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer) or require chemotherapy

             Chediak-Higashi syndrome, combined immunodeficiency disease, complement deficiencies,
             DiGeorge syndrome, HIV/AIDS, hypogammaglobulinemia, Job syndrome, leukocyte adhesion
             defects, malnutrition, panhypogammaglobulinemia, Bruton disease, congenital
             agammaglobulinemia, selective deficiency of IgA and Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome)

         24. Individuals who have had previous neurosurgical intervention involving the frontal
             lobes (especially the motor cortex) and/or parietal lobe (especially the somatosensory
             cortex) that is likely to impact the viability of an intracortical electrode

         25. Individuals with active psychiatric concerns, including but not limited to major
