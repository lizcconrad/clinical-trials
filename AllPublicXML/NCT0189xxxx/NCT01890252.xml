      The Hyper-CL™ lenses are indicated for therapeutic use as a bandage to protect the corneal
      surface and to relieve corneal pain in the treatment of acute or chronic ocular pathologies,
      such as bullous keratopathy, corneal erosions, entropion, corneal edema, and corneal
      dystrophies as well as post-surgical conditions resulting from cataract extraction and
      corneal surgery. The lenses may be prescribed for daily wear with removal for cleaning and
      disinfection (chemical, not heat) prior to reinsertion, as recommended by the eye care
      professional.

      In addition Hyper-CL™ contact lenses can also provide optical correction during healing if
      required.

      Prospective open-label, randomized, crossover clinical study To evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the Hyper-CL™ lens in subjects suffering from corneal edema.

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the Hyper-CL™ lens contact lens on corneal
      edema thickness as compared with salt solution treatment only in subjects suffering from
      corneal edema.

      Treatment with the Hyper-CL™ lens may result with greater reduction in edema thickness as
      compared with treatment with salt solution only in subjects suffering from corneal edema.

      Men and women suffering from a decrease in vision due to corneal edema that meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written Informed Consent will be enrolled in the
      study.

      A total of 25 subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will be treated with:

        -  Treatment A: Hyper-CL™ lens only (7 days)

        -  Treatment B: Hyper-CL™ lens + salt solution (7 days)

        -  Treatment C: salt solution only (7 days) One week (7 days) of washout without any
           treatment will be between treatments. Subject will be equally allocated (with a
           1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of the following 6 crossover regimen based on a randomization
           scheme with blocks stratified by center: C-A-B; B-C-A; A-B-C; C-B-A; B-A-C; A-C-B.

      Up to 2 centers will participate in this study. Each subject will be followed from baseline
      to 42 days. All Subjects will come for a clinic visit at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days post
      first treatment.

      Completion of active enrolment is anticipated to last approximately 6 months. The primary end
      point will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 42 day follow-up.

      The frequency and severity of all treatment-related adverse events, during and after using
      the Hyper-CL™ lens. Adverse events will be assessed on a continuous basis from the first

      keratitis, allergic or toxic inflammatory reaction, significant increase in corneal edema.
