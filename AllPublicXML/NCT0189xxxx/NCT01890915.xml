  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deleterious effects of hyperthermia are well appreciated in able-bodied persons. However,
      the consequences of impaired regulation of normal body temperature on cognitive performance
      of persons with tetraplegia is not known. This study will provide the preliminary findings
      necessary for future work to design and explore physical and medical interventions to improve
      temperature regulation in those with tetraplegia with the goal of improved clinical care,
      health, and quality of life.

      The proposed study consists of 1 visit during which 20 subjects (10 with tetraplegia, 10
      controls) will be exposed to 81°F for 40 minutes and then 95° F for up to 2 hours.
      Physiological as well as psychological processes will be monitored in all subjects during the
      study for safety and to determine differences in responses to exposure to hot ambient
      temperatures

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) the motor, sensory and autonomic deficits cause,
      among other detriments, a blunted ability to maintain a constant core temperature. Impaired
      thermoregulation leaves persons with tetraplegia more susceptible to hyperthermia than
      able-bodied persons (AB). There has been a paucity of work addressing the thermoregulatory
      responses of persons with SCI to hot ambient temperatures, and even less study addressing the
      effect of these temperatures on cognitive performance. The goals of this pilot study are: to
      improve our understanding of the thermoregulatory mechanisms of individuals with tetraplegia
      when exposed to heat and to determine the effect of impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms on
      cognitive performance during exposure to 35°C for up to 2 hours. In order to address our
      goals we have designed a study methodology which consists of comparing the physiological and
      psychological responses of the two study groups (tetraplegia versus AB controls) from
      thermoneutral (27°C) to hot (35°C) environments.

    <measure>Core Body Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the change in core body temperature in the seated position from 79 degrees F for 30 minutes to 95 degrees F for up to 2 hours. Hypotheses: Persons with tetraplegia will have a greater increase in core body temperature than able-bodied (AB) control subjects. Core body temperature in AB persons will be maintained.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Performance - Stroop Interference T-Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the change in cognitive performance as measured by the Stroop Color and Word Interference T-Scores, measured after 30 min at 79 degrees F and after up to 2 hours at 95 degrees F. Interference T-Scores are derived from the difference between the raw Color-Word score and the projected Color-Word score (which is, in turn, based on the raw scores obtained in the Word and Color portions of the Test). Lower scores indicate poorer performance, and a positive percent change in T-scores indicates improved performance. Hypothesis: Persons with tetraplegia compared with AB will have a greater change in cognitive performance from baseline (79 degrees) to warm exposure (95 degrees).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sweat Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the change in sweat rate using QSweat methodology (WR TestWorks) from 30 minutes at 79 degrees F compared to after up to 2 hours at 95 degrees F. Sweat collection capsules will be placed on the left lateral anterior shoulder, volar aspect of the distal forearm, proximal anterior thigh, and mid-lateral calf (dermatomes C5, T1, L3, L5) for measurement of sweat rate. Hypothesis: Persons with tetraplegia compared with AB will have less of a percent change in average sweat rate after heat exposure.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Performance - Stroop Interference T-Scores</title>
        <description>To determine the change in cognitive performance as measured by the Stroop Color and Word Interference T-Scores, measured after 30 min at 79 degrees F and after up to 2 hours at 95 degrees F. Interference T-Scores are derived from the difference between the raw Color-Word score and the projected Color-Word score (which is, in turn, based on the raw scores obtained in the Word and Color portions of the Test). Lower scores indicate poorer performance, and a positive percent change in T-scores indicates improved performance. Hypothesis: Persons with tetraplegia compared with AB will have a greater change in cognitive performance from baseline (79 degrees) to warm exposure (95 degrees).</description>
