    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The change in pruritus score from Baseline to Week 12 (or end of treatment).
The pruritus grading system (PGS) score for each patient was based on: distribution, frequency,severity of itch and quality of sleep. Each patient's itch grade is calculated as the sum of the individual scores as:
Mild grade: if total score is between 0 and 5. Moderate grade: if total score is between 6 and 11. Severe grade: if total score is between 12 and 19.</description>

    <description>Thalidomide will be administered nightly, with each subject taking 2 capsules totaling 100 milligrams for the initial two weeks of treatment, 3 capsules totaling 150 milligrams for week 2 to week 4, and 4 capsules totaling 200 milligrams for week 4 to end of treatment. The subjects will take the medication for 12 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older.

          -  Stable or worsening psoriasis that involves 5% or greater of total body surface area
             (BSA) involvement with a minimum PASI score of 8.

          -  Moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, defined by a minimum score of 1 for each of
             erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness (using a 0 - 4 scale).

          -  Patients receiving systemic retinoids, prednisone, methotrexate, or cyclosporine
             should be on a stable dose at least 28 days prior to the first dose of thalidomide.

          -  Patients receiving topical treatments should be consistent with such treatments
             throughout the study.

          -  The ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled
             visits, and successfully complete the study.

          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be
             obtained prior to treatment.

          -  The ability to understand, agree to, and comply with the requirements of the System
             for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.).**

        (*Because of the known teratogenic effects of thalidomide and in an effort to prevent to
        the greatest extent possible any chance of fetal exposure to thalidomide,
        THALOMID(thalidomide) is approved for marketing only under a special restricted
        distribution program approved by the FDA. Under this program, the System for Thalidomide
        Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.), only prescribers and pharmacists registered
        with the program are allowed to prescribe and dispense thalidomide (Zeldis JB et al. 1999).
        In addition, patients must be advised of, agree to, and comply with the requirements of the
        S.T.E.P.S. Program. To monitor patient compliance with the S.T.E.P.S. program, all patients
        must complete the S.T.E.P.S. program informed consent and participate in a mandatory and
        confidential surveillance registry.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable psoriasis

          -  Unable or unwilling to meet all criteria for contraception as required in STEPS.

          -  Known allergy to thalidomide.

          -  Known history of neuropathy.

          -  Abnormal laboratory test results that the investigator feels would compromise patient
             safety or evaluation of drug safety.

          -  The introduction of drugs for other medical conditions which are known to affect
             psoriasis (e.g., lithium, beta-adrenergic blockers, etc.) during the period 4 weeks
             prior to and during the study period.

          -  Use of any investigational therapy within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             thalidomide.

          -  Expectation of exposure to strong sunlight during the course of the study (e.g.
             planned holiday in high sunlight area) or intention of sunbathing for prolonged
             periods of time during the course of the study.

          -  Current drug or alcohol abuse (drug screening not required).

          -  Medical conditions that preclude thalidomide therapy. Any other condition which, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject at unacceptable risk for
             participation in the study.
