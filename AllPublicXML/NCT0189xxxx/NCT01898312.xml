  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian steroids, as well as their synthetic counterparts gestagens and estrogens have a role
      in breast cell proliferation and the development of breast cancer. Here, the effect of a
      progesterone receptor modulator, mifepristone, on cell proliferation in human breast tissue
      in vivo will be studied in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations. Our preliminary results
      implicate a possible protective effect of mifepristone in breast epithelium. The ability of
      mifepristone to block breast epithelial cell proliferation may prevent tumorigenesis and may
      also prove beneficial when used for contraceptive purposes and on other indications. The
      proposed project concerns a Randomized Controlled Trial on mifepristone versus placebo
      treatment of women with BRCA-1or -2 mutations with a high risk/incidence of breast cancer and
      ovarian cancer.

      Objectives • Research objective To study the safety and effect of treatment with
      mifepristone, a progesterone receptor modulator, on epithelial cell proliferation in human
      breast tissue in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations prior to protective mastectomy.

      Project description

      • Hypothesis/ Theory Mifepristone treatment exerts an antiproliferative, protective effect on
      breast tissue in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations

      Study Design Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Women will be recruited
      among patients with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations scheduled for prophylactic mastectomy. Included
      women will be randomized to a 3-month treatment with mifepristone, 50 mg (Mifegyne, Exelgyn,
      Paris, France) or placebo taken orally every second day. Breast biopsies will be obtained in
      the luteal phase prior to start of treatment and again during surgery.
