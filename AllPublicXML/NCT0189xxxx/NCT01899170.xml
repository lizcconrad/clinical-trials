  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neuropathic pain affects millions of individuals worldwide. It causes marked
      reduction of health, utility and quality of life and represents a considerable economic
      burden to society due to loss of work capacity and large treatment expenses. The proposed
      project will explore new and rational methods for deep brain stimulation treatment of
      patients with severe chronic neuropathic pain, resistant to conventional treatment. Deep
      brain stimulation is a neurosurgical procedure in which a small stimulating electrode is
      implanted into deep brain areas. Furthermore, we will utilize new positron emission
      tomography neuroimaging and a new prototyped technology, called targeted transcranial
      magnetic stimulation, to predict the outcome of deep brain stimulation and localize brain
      regions with maximum symptom relief for each patient. This will optimize the selection of
      patients for deep brain stimulation and provide a rational customized choice of brain target
      for each patient, without surgical intervention. Novel techniques will be validated on
      healthy volunteers and at the same time provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying
      brain stimulation and pain perception. The project has great clinical impact, potential for
      innovative development and industrial spin-out, facilitates exchange for Danish research
      talents and senior researchers with Stanford University and California Pacific Medical
      Research Institute in San Francisco, and unites world leading experts in pain research and
      clinical treatment to achieve its goals.

    <description>We will measure the changes in pain ratings upon deep brain stimulation of the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus.

    <description>Individuals will be classified according to PET activity/no-activity and positive/null-negative outcome of transcranial magnetic stimulation. We will correlate the effect of deep brian stimulation to these categories and evaluate their predictive values.</description>

    <description>We will do test/re-test PET imaging before and after deep brain stimulation surgery to assess the effect of this treatment on cingulate opioid binding and blood flow. We will utilize 11C-Carfentanil and 15O-water PET, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Pain relief upon individualized deep brain stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 and 12 months of active deep brain stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Patients that derive no benefit from initial deep brain stimulation treatment of the dorsal anterior cingulate, will be offered deep brain stimulation of another expectedly efficacious brain area. The choice of target will be based of PET images and magnetic stimulation testing. Results of deep brain stimulation will be based on the numerical rating scale and validated pain questionnaires.</description>

    <measure>Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on pain ratings, cingulate opioid binding and blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>results will be assessed upon final transcranial magnetic stimulation session (last participant/last treatment, average 5 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>We will do test/re-test PET imaging with transcranial magnetic stimulation in between. We will evaluate quantitative effects on 1) pain ratings using the numerical rating scale, 2) cingulate opioid binding using 11C-carfentanil PET and 3) cingulate blood flow using 15O-water PET. Results will be compared for sham stimulation and active stimulation in each individual, and also between cases and controls.</description>
