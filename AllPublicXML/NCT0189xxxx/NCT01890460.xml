  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare ultrasound measurements of the liver obtained prior to
      surgery on the skin to measurements obtained during surgery directly on the diseased liver.
      The objective is to determine if ultrasounds of the liver on the skin can provide accurate
      measurements of disease of the liver to provide an alternative option to liver biopsies.

      A non-invasive, ultrasound platform based, ShearWaveTM Elastography measurement will be
      obtained at two time points on each qualified patient. The first time point will be in the
      operating room before the initial incision is made. The second time point involves placement
      of a small, hand-held modified ultrasound probe directly on the patient's diseased liver
      during the liver transplant surgery. The probe used in this study is the SuperCurvedâ„¢SC6-1,
      capable of a band width of 1-6MHz with 192 elements.
