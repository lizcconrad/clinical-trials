  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional study of a novel non-invasive optical flare photometer (OFAM).
      Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive a standard eye examination
      including a slit lamp examination to collect ocular flare data. In addition to the standard
      eye examination, subjects will receive flare measurements using the OFAM device.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        All patients with uveitis seen in the uveitis clinic at the UW Medicine Eye Institute would
        be eligible for participation in the uveitis arm of the study (n ≤ 50). Patients with
        other, non-inflammatory forms of eye disease will be eligible for the non-inflammatory arm
        of the study (n ≤ 50).
