  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the quantity of iron derived from SFP that is
      transferred from the dialysate to patients during a single dialysis session. The effects of
      various conditions which may affect the transfer of iron such as blood and dialysate flow
      rate, changes in bicarbonate delivery, dialyzer membrane type and the effect of reuse will
      also be investigated. The absorption and removal of iron from the blood will also be
      investigated.

    <textblock>
      -  A total of 12 subjects on standard 3X/week hemodialysis will be studied in 2 groups (6
           subjects per group)

        -  2 primary dialyzer membranes will be studied.:

             -  Polyamide Membrane (Gambro Polyflux series: 17R and 21R)

             -  Cellulose Triacetate (Baxter CT series: CT-190)

        -  Each 1-week treatment cycle will include 3 haemodialysis (HD) sessions per subject,
           including 2 study treatment-HD sessions and 1 non-treatment-HD session per subject.
           Treatment-HD sessions will be conducted midweek and end-of-week (i.e. Dialysis days 3
           and 5 of each week with a 1 day interdialytic interval) to avoid excessive fluid shifts
           due to the increased UF needed during the non-treatment HD session (conducted at
           beginning of the week; HD day 1).

        -  Within each group, each subject will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. The
           treatments to be investigated are: Control; new dialyzer, reused dialyzer, low blood
           flow/dialysate flow, Low bicarbonate concentration and a different synthetic dialyzer
           membrane (PAES)

        -  Blood for a complete serum iron profile over time will be obtained during the new
           dialyzer (SFP/standard bicarbonate/new dialyzer/ high Qb and Qd) for all subjects. This
           will necessitate approximately a 24-hour inpatient confinement to obtain blood at
           specified time intervals after dialysis is completed. Blood for a partial iron profile
           will be collected during the dialysis sessions at all other dialysis sessions.

        -  Each of the 6 enrolled subjects per dialyzer membrane type will be assigned to a
           different sequence of treatments to help ensure that the treatment sequence does not
           affect the analysis (Note: the first dialysis sessions of each of the 3 study weeks,
           i.e. HD1, HD4 and HD7, are non-study related sessions during which no study procedures
           are performed except for adverse event collection.

        -  Patients should not be receiving any of the following medications from screening through
           the end of the study:

             -  Oral iron preparations, including multivitamin supplements containing iron

             -  Intravenous iron preparations

        -  Doses of ESA's should not be changed from screening to the end of the study.

          <description>Enrolled subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the type of dialyzer membrane used by each subject at Screening: Baxter CT-190 (Group 1; N = 6; cellulose triacetate membrane) or Gambro 17R/21R (Group 2; N = 6; polyamide membrane). Within each dialyzer membrane group, each subject received one control treatment and 5 treatments with SFP added to dialysate. Treatment B was one dialysis session with SFP added to the bicarbonate, with standard bicarbonate concentration, blood flow rate, dialysis flow rate, and new Gambro 17R/21R PAES membrane dialyzer.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Total iron, TBI, NTBI, and UIBC could not be measured because the ferrozine assay for total iron and transferrin-bound iron was unreliable due to the presence of heparin in the samples, which caused the formation of fibrin strands.</limitations_and_caveats>
