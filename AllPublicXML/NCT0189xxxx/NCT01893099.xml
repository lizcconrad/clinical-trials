    <textblock>
      The best way to combine a loco-regional procedure such as chemoembolisation or
      radioembolization combined with an anti-angiogenic drug is not clear. This phase I trial aims
      to establish, first, the tolerability of the combination of liver radioembolization with
      SirSpheres® and sorafenib in uveal melanoma patients with liver metastasis studying different
      schedules of administration of sorafenib after and before radioembolization. Secondly, we aim
      to evaluate angiogenic markers modifications during these different schedules, either in the
      serum or radiologicaly. Dose of Sorafenib will be 400 mg BID and the timing of introduction
      will differ for one cohort to the other, given after the radioembolization for initials
      cohorts and finally, before and concomitantly to radioembolization for the last cohort.

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sorafenib in combination with SIR-Spheres®
      radioembolization in uveal melanoma patients metastatic to the liver.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Translational research on biomarkers (blood and liver biopsies) as well as on
           radiological exam by using microbubble contrast enhanced ultrasound. Angiogenic markers
           such as VEGF, IGF-2, TFG Angiopoietin-2 and IL-8 will be monitored. Correlations will be
           investigated between the angiogenic markers (blood &amp; tumor tissue), angiogenic
           radiological exam and the response to the treatment.

        -  To evaluate the response, clinical benefit, PFS and survival of the patients.
