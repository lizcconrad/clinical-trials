  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, multi-center, placebo controlled, three parallel arms,
      Phase IIb/III clinical study to evaluate the effects of adding a TCM-700C with a low or high
      dose onto the combination treatment (PegIFN plus RBV) for subjects with naive genotype 1 HCV
      infection.

      This will be demonstrated by a higher sustained virologic response rate, defined as the
      absence of detectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the termination of combination treatment,
      compared with the placebo add-on.

      Eligible subjects with written informed consent will be stratified according to their
      baseline HCV RNA (≤800,000 IU/mL versus&gt;800,000 IU/mL), stage of liver fibrosis (METAVIR
      system fibrosis score of 0 1 versus 2 3).

      During the 48 week Treatment Period and 24 week Follow up Period, subjects will be assessed
      at regular intervals for efficacy and safety at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter until study completion. If possible, subjects who prematurely discontinue the
      study during the Treatment Period will have samples taken for hematology, biochemistry and
      urinalysis in the same week of discontinuation as well as 24 weeks after discontinuation.
