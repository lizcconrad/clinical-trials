  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), negatively
      influencing their quality of life, treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein is
      generally a central component of weight loss in CKD patients but patients also have
      reductions in fat mass and bone density, independent of the severity of the disease state.
      Attempts to reverse weight and muscle loss in CKD and improve nutritional status by
      nutritional supplementation have been unsuccessful and there are currently no approved
      therapies.

      Purpose of this study is to provide detailed insight in disease related gut function by
      obtaining information on gut permeability, digestion and absorption of glucose, fat and
      protein in CKD patients compared to matched healthy controls. Additionally, to examine
      whether protein and amino acid metabolism is disturbed in CKD patients compared to healthy
      controls. This will provide required information that will lead to implement new strategies
      to develop optimal nutritional regimen in order to enhance nutritional status, quality of
      life and survival in relation to kidney disease.

      This study involves one test day of approximately 7-8 hours. On this test day subjects will
      ingest a sugar drink to assess gut permeability and gut function, and a protein meal to
      measure digestion/absorption and the anabolic response to food intake. Subjects will also
      receive a mixture of amino acids that are made a little heavier than normal, called stable
      isotopes. This stable isotopes is used to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein
      kinetics). Blood (100-120 ml in total) and urine samples will be collected over 7.5 hours.
