      A single Center, Prospective Phase IV, Open-Label, Controlled, Randomized Trial comparing the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Quadritherapy regimen (Reiferon Retard® , Ribavirin ,
      Nitazoxanide and Alfacalcidol (Bon-One ® ) versus Triple therapy regimen (Reiferon Retard® ,
      Ribavirin and Nitazoxanide) versus the standard of care regimen(Reiferon Retard® and
      Ribavirin) in the treatment of Naïve chronic hepatitis C among the Egyptian population.
      Effectiveness will be evaluated based on Sustained Virological Response (SVR) .

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S): The primary objectives of this trial are as follows:

        -  To compare the efficacy of the three treatment arms in naïve Chronic Hepatitis C Virus
           (HCV) genotype 4 patients by evaluating the sustained virological response ( SVR) at
           week 60 ( 3 months after end of treatment period)

        -  Identify optimum treatment protocol for HCV genotype 4 in respect to used combination of
           medications

        -  Whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, could improve viral response.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase IV, single center, open labeled, randomized (1:1:1) controlled
      study.

      NUMBER OF EVALUABLE SUBJECTS: 300 NUMBER OF CENTER/S: 1 Country:Egypt DURATION OF THE STUDY:
      94 weeks TREATMENT: randomized 1:1:1 ratio into 3 Arms SUBJECT POPULATION: male or female
      subjects assessed by BMI less than 35, between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Subjects have to
      be diagnosed as Naïve Chronic Hepatitis C genotype 4 patients with compensated liver disease
      assessed by hematological and biochemical tests.

      - DURATION OF THE STUDY: 94 weeks as follows:

      Estimated Enrollment Duration: 16 weeks Collection of last Case Report Form (CRF) : 2 weeks
      from Last patient out. Queries Resolution: 4 weeks from Collection of last CRF. Database lock
      planned date: 2 weeks from Quires resolution. Final Study Report: 8 weeks from Database lock.
      Estimated duration of subject participation: 62 weeks as follows;

        -  Screening period per subject = 2 weeks

        -  Treatment phase per subject = 48 weeks

        -  Follow-up phase per subject = 12 weeks

      N.B : Each patient will receive medications for Maximum 48 weeks if his/her Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR) -ve at weeks 12 and 24 , and if his/her PCR +ve at week 12 or week 24 the
      treatment will be stopped .
