    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the study drug LY2875358,
      given together with erlotinib, against erlotinib, alone. Participants will have Non-Small
      Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that has advanced to Stage IV. Participants should not have been
      treated with drugs for Stage IV NSCLC, previously. All participants will get erlotinib alone,
      for approximately 8 weeks. Participants with radiographic disease control at the end of the
      erlotinib lead-in study period will be randomly assigned to receive LY2875358 plus erlotinib
      or erlotinib alone. Participants, who were chosen to receive erlotinib, alone, may cross over
      to the combination treatment at the time of progression.
