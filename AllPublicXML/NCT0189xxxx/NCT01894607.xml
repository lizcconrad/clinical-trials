  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research is to learn how effective an ultrasound contrast agent,
      called DEFINITY, is when used during ultrasound-guided surgery to remove part of one or both
      kidneys.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DEFINITY is a contrast agent that is used to create better quality ultrasound images.

      On the day before or the day of the standard of care surgery, women who are able to become
      pregnant must have a negative blood or urine pregnancy test. If it a blood pregnancy test is
      performed, a portion of blood will be used from routine blood draws that are collected as
      part of your standard of care surgery.

      During your standard of care surgery, the radiologist will take images and videos with an
      ultrasound machine before you are given the contrast agent. This is done to learn if cancer
      has spread around the kidney.

      You will then receive the DEFINITY by vein over about 1 minute. After you receive the
      injection of DEFINITY, the radiologist will take more images and videos of the tumor and
      kidney(s) to compare to those recorded earlier.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation in this study will be over after you have completed the follow-up
      visit.

      Follow-Up Phone Call:

      You will have a follow-up phone call 30 days after your standard of care surgery is complete
      to review any side effects you may be having. This call should take about 10 minutes to
      complete.

      This is an investigational study. DEFINITY is FDA approved and commercially available for use
      in contrast enhanced echocardiography. It is not FDA approved or commercially available for
      use in radiology.

      Up to 11 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
