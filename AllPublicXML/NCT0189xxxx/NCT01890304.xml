  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify the changes in the brain following repeated sports-related concussion in men's
      football, women's soccer, and women's lacrosse college athletes by reviewing the findings of
      MRI studies that look at the structure of the brain and the appearance of the white matter at
      baseline, during the acute phase of a concussive injury, and upon completion of collegiate
      athletic play and correlate these findings with standard clinical measures.

      This proposal seeks to study Diffusion Tensor Imaging and functional MRI of the brain at 1)
      baseline, 2) after concussion and 3) at the end of an athlete's college career. Findings will
      be compared to standard clinical measures already performed in the management of concussion
      at the University of Florida Athletic Association and to serum biomarkers already being
      obtained as part of a UF/ Banyan Biomarker Study. As in the biomarker study, UF athletes on
      teams with higher incidences of sports related concussion; men's football, women's soccer,
      and women's lacrosse will be offered enrollment.

      Longitudinal examinations will allow identification and quantification of concussive DTI
      findings as comparisons can be made to the individual athlete's baseline data. This will
      provide valuable correlation of imaging findings with severity of clinical symptoms at the
      time of injury and also with timing of return to play.
