      This pilot clinical trial studies how well desipramine hydrochloride and filgrastim works for
      stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing stem cell transplant.
      Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, and other drugs, such as desipramine
      hydrochloride, helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can
      be collected and stored.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study efficacy, safety, harvest kinetics and engraftment kinetics of patients
      undergoing autologous stem cell mobilization, mobilized with a combination of granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (filgrastim) with desipramine (desipramine hydrochloride)
      (G+D).

      II. To analyze polymorphisms of adrenergic receptor beta 2 (ADRB2) and adrenergic receptor
      beta 3 (ADRB3) genes that correlate with mobilization efficiency.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive desipramine hydrochloride orally (PO) daily on days -3 to +4 and filgrastim
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-4. Stem cell collection begins on day 6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 1 week after completion of stem
      cell collection.
