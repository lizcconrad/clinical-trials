  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess safety and
      tolerability of GSK2330672 administration in subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
      and symptoms of pruritus. It is a double-blind, crossover study with subjects receiving
      placebo or GSK23306772 in random order during two 14-day treatment periods. Additionally, the
      study will determine GSK2330672 exposure and interactions with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
      The total duration of subject participation will be 14 weeks for screening (45 days) and the
      treatment period. Subjects who are eligible for enrolment will participate in a 2-week
      placebo run-in period. Subjects will be randomized in a crossover fashion (Sequence 1 /
      Sequence 2) to receive placebo or GSK2330672 treatment during two consecutive 2-week study
      periods. Subjects will then participate in a 2-week placebo dosing follow-up period ending in
      final follow-up assessments. Study results will be utilized to form a benefit: risk profile
      for GSK2330672 in PBC that will determine plans for progression to exploratory efficacy
      trials

             following: history of sustained increased alkaline phosphatise (AP) levels first
             recognized at least 6 months prior to Day 1; positive antimitochondrial antibodies
             (AMA) titer (&gt;1:40 titer on immunofluorescence or M2 positive by enzyme-linked
             immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) or PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies (antinuclear dot
             and nuclear rim positive); liver biopsy consistent with PBC.

          -  Screening AP value between &lt;=&lt;10 × upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Subjects should be on stable doses of UDCA for &gt;8 weeks at time of screening. Subjects

             after at least one previous therapy has been discontinued due to inadequate clinical
             response, poor tolerability or adverse events. Temporary response to cooling, 1%
             menthol in aqueous cream, nasobiliary drainage or molecular adsorbent recirculating
             system (MARS) therapy is still compatible with refractory itch; PBC subjects with
             unresolved symptoms with use of a single antipruritic agent who can tolerate washout
             of current therapy for the duration of the trial; PBC subjects seeking treatment for
             pruritus that is newly diagnosed or previously untreated.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, as confirmed by a
             negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test or at least one of the
             following conditions applies: Non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal
             females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as
             12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milli-international units per
             milliliter and estradiol &lt;40 picograms per milliliter (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception

             protection (condoms with spermicide) if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrolment; Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of
             the contraception options methods for the specified duration of time.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
