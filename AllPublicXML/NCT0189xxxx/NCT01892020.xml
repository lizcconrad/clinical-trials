    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of biphasic insulin aspart 50 (BIAsp 50) twice daily versus biphasic human insulin 50
      (BHI 50) twice daily, both in combination with metformin, in Chinese subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

Group A received BIAsp 50 twice daily (BID) during the first 4 weeks (period 1), then switched to BHI 50 BID for further 4 weeks (period 2). BIAsp 50 (NovoMix® 50) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) using NovoPen 4 immediately before breakfast and dinner. And BHI 50 was administered s.c. using NovoPen 4 at least 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. All subjects received metformin throughout this trial. Insulin dose was adjusted twice weekly based on self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG).</description>
