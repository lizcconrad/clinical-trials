  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ferumoxytol, when given at the time
      of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can help researchers learn more about the spread of
      certain kinds of cancers.

      Ferumoxytol is designed to deliver iron to treat iron-deficiency anemia (low red blood cell
      counts) in patients with chronic kidney disease. In this study, it will be used as an MRI
      contrast. Contrasts are used by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly.

      Study Scans:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have 2 study MRIs. These
      scans will be performed at the Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), in the South
      Campus Research Building at MD Anderson.

      On Day 1, you will have 2 standard MRIs, as part of your standard of care. About an hour
      after these 2 scans, you will receive ferumoxytol by vein. Right after that, you will have
      your first study MRI. The study MRI will be performed in the same way that a standard MRI is
      performed.

      On Day 2, about 24 and 72 hours after you receive ferumoxytol, you will have a second study
      MRI.

      Additional Tests:

      On Days 1 and 3, as well as 4 weeks after the first study MRI:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and/or to check your iron
           level.

      On Day 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  If you have not had one in the last month, you will have a PET-CT scan to check the
           status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for about 4 weeks. You will be taken off study if you have intolerable
      side effects or you are unable to have the scans for any reason.

      This is an investigational study. Ferumoxytol is commercially available and FDA-approved for
      the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.

      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Feasibility defined as at least 15 (75%) patients finish the imaging process and good quality images obtained. Good quality image defined as subjective quality assessment score of 4 by two independent radiation oncologists and one radiologist for clinical usability for radiotherapy planning on a 5-point scale. The 5-point scale is defined with 0 implying unable to assess and 5 implying optimal image quality.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 18 years of age or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed head
             and neck squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma

          2. Measurable clinical and/or radiographic poly-nodal disease defined as stage N2b, N2c
             or N3 disease with multiple involved lymph nodes as defined by the American Joint
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging criteria

          3. Patients who have received or are dispositioned to receive a Positron emission
             tomography (PET) and computerized tomography (CT) [PET-CT] scan within two weeks of
             starting definitive therapy for their head and neck malignancy and their participation
             in this study. This implies patients must receive a PET-CT to be eligible for the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have undergone definitive resection of their primary or nodal disease as
             well as any chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their head and neck primary tumor.

          2. Patients unable or unwilling to give written, informed consent or to undergo MRI
             imaging.

          3. Women of childbearing potential (A woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually
             mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses at any
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months]). Male partners must practice effective
             contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal
             ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized
             partner) throughout the study.

          4. Patients unable to tolerate DCE-MRI or having an estimated GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m^2.

          5. Contraindications to iron supplementation include hemochromatosis, colitis, history of
             GI bleeds, alcoholism, or liver disease. Ferumoxytol is contraindicated in patients
             with evidence of iron overload and/or known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its
             components. Consequently, we will plan to exclude patients who have symptoms or signs
             that might be caused by iron overload. These include patients with (unexplained):
             arthritis (including premature osteoarthritis), congestive heart failure or
             cardiomyopathy, adult-onset diabetes, secondary hypogonadism, increased skin
             pigmentation, or patients with persistently elevated serum ferritin not explained by
             an underlying inflammatory/systemic disease, unless these patients demonstrate a
             fasting transferrin saturation &lt;/= 0.45.

          6. Patients with any evidence of iron overload on pre-imaging laboratory studies.

          7. Patients with any contraindications to gadolinium-based contrast agents.

          8. Patients with claustrophobia.
