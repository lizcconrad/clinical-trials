    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy for all patients will be evaluated by the study sites using RECIST v1.1 and response criteria based on contrast-enhanced CT. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Progression must also involve an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 mm, to minimize the possibility that small changes in a small number of target lesions is falsely interpreted as progression.Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming
        pregnant, are not allowed to participate in this study UNLESS they are using highly
        effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after study drug
        discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods include:

        Total abstinence or

          -  Male or female sterilization

          -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

                    -  Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are
                       considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
                       had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                       clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or
                       six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone
                       (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with
                       or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to
                       screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment
                       is she considered not of child bearing potential.

        Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 5
        T1/2 after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is
        required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via
        seminal fluid.

        History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events within the last 6 months, including
        transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary
        embolism.

          -  Patients who have undergone any major surgery within the last 2 weeks prior to
             starting study drug or who would not have fully recovered from previous surgery.

          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection

          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for the
             study.

        <description>Efficacy for all patients will be evaluated by the study sites using RECIST v1.1 and response criteria based on contrast-enhanced CT. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Progression must also involve an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 mm, to minimize the possibility that small changes in a small number of target lesions is falsely interpreted as progression.Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
