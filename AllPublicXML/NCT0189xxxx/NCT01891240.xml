  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the IMPROvED project is to develop a sensitive, specific,
      high-throughput and economically viable early pregnancy screening test for preeclampsia.

      This will involve a multicentre, phase IIa clinical predictive study to assess and refine
      novel and innovative prototype tests based on emerging metabolomic and proteomic technologies
      developed by SMEs (small to medium size enterprise) within the consortium. The study will i)
      recruit 5000 first-time pregnant women; ii) establish a high calibre biobank, augmented by
      accurate clinical metadata; iii) determine whether prototype predictive assays and algorithms
      translate to the clinical environment; iv) assess potential synergy of a combined metabolomic
      and proteomic approach and v) progress regulatory approval and development of the selected
      test into the clinical arena.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample size calculations have been considered extensively and given the complexity of the
      study; there is no single simple solution. For the purpose of sample size estimation in the
      overall study, we used a binary outcome and associated measures of sensitivity and likelihood
      ratio as determinants of the value of these tests. Although the predictive algorithms will
      produce a continuous risk score, the use of a categorical outcome fits with the final binary
      decision process (to treat or not to treat) based on the risk score. Based on the lowest
      estimated prevalence of pre-eclampsia of 3% and a test sensitivity of 93% and a test
      specificity of 97%, then to be 90% certain that the true specificity of the patient
      population is no less than 95%, a sample size of 4,800 participants is required. Thus,
      allowing for patient dropout, a study population of 5,000 women is needed.

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Essential hypertension treated pre-pregnancy.

          -  Moderate-severe hypertension at booking (BP &gt;160/100 mmHg).

          -  Diabetes mellitus.

          -  Renal disease.

          -  Systemic lupus erythematosus.

          -  Anti-phospholipid syndrome.

          -  Sickle cell disease.

          -  HIV positive.

          -  Hepatitis B or C positive.

          -  Major uterine anomaly.

          -  Cervical suture in situ.

          -  Knife cone biopsy.

          -  Long-term steroids.

          -  Treatment with low-dose aspirin.

          -  Treatment with heparin/LMW heparin.

          -  Lack of informed consent.

        After recruitment, if the woman is found to be outside the stated gestation limits for the
        IMPROvED 1st visit of 9 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days she will be retained in the study
        if she is willing to take part in the second and third visit and is otherwise eligible.
        There is one pre-specified criteria for discontinuation of a participant. If a woman is
        recruited into the IMPROvED study and later identified as having a pregnancy exclusion
        criterion, i.e., ≥ 3 miscarriages, ≥ 3 TOPS, or using low-dose aspirin at the time of
        recruitment, she shall be excluded. However, women diagnosed during the pregnancy but after
        recruitment with an exclusion criterion, e.g., diseases such as renal disease,
        anti-phospholipid syndrome, etc. shall be retained within the study. Women who are
        recruited but later discontinue from the study do not count towards recruitment targets for
        each centre. Accordingly, such dropouts must be replaced.
