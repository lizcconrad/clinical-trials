      To compare e-screening versus usual screening on: 1) women's and healthcare providers' views
      on feasibility and acceptability; 2) rates of detection of prenatal and postpartum depression
      and anxiety; 3) perceived risk and benefit of disclosure; 4) cost-effectiveness; 5)
      psychometric properties. We also aim to identify factors associated with feasibility of
      e-screening.Compared to usual screening:1) e-screening is as feasible; 2) e-screening yields
      similar rates of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety; 3) the mean score for risk
      of disclosure is significantly lower and benefit of disclosure is significantly higher in the
      e-screening group; 4) e-screening is as or more cost effective in detecting prenatal and
      postpartum depression and anxiety; 5) features of e-screening are significantly associated
      with feasibility and acceptability, whereas demographic factors are not; and 6) reliability
      and validity indices of ALPHA and EPDS are strongly correlated for both administration modes.

      Given that it is critical to conduct screening within a system that links referral and
      treatment, our IMPACT pilot trial is evaluating integrated screening and care (see Summary of
      Progress) versus usual prenatal care. The proposed trial engages 2 unique clinics with
      experienced staff who conduct routine screening (with referrals and treatment in place) to
      evaluate different modalities of screening. Since widespread screening is unlikely to be
      successfully implemented if it entails additional human resources, this trial assesses the
      potential for a sustainable, e-health alternative.

We will also interview the clinic manager to determine the costs of current screening process (e.g., time to screen, physical resources).</description>
