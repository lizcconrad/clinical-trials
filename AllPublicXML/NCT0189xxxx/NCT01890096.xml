  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR) treatment combined with a short course of
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a highly effective and well tolerated treatment for men
      with intermediate risk prostate cancer. High cancer control rates have also been reported
      with HDR used on its own, without the EBRT. The challenge has been to determine what HDR dose
      to use with a move towards one or two fractions by several investigators. These schedules are
      reported to be well tolerated in the short term, but with little long term data. The
      objective of this study is to investigate HDR monotherapy given as either one fraction of 19
      Gy or two fractions of 13.5 Gy in a randomized phase II clinical trial. The primary endpoint
      is patient reported toxicity and health related quality of life at 1 year, and efficacy data
      will be also be analyzed. Sample size for the study is 174 patients, which we expect to
      accrue within 18 months.
