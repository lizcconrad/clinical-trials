    <textblock>
      The first goal of this study is to examine the extent to which the inclusion of dual-task
      practice to standard balance rehabilitation results in greater benefits to dual-task ability.
      The second goal of this study is to examine the extent to which the addition of cognitive
      training following balance rehabilitation results in greater benefits to dual-task ability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, degradation of balance control in older adults has been attributed to
      impairments of the motor and/or sensory systems. As a result, therapy has focused on motor
      and sensory impairments. However, evidence suggests that an impaired ability to allocate
      attentional resources to balance during dual-task situations is a powerful predictor of
      falls. Despite this fact, few studies have examined whether interventions can improve older
      adults' dual-task ability. The goal of this study is to develop effective interventions to
      improve ability to allocate attention to balance and gait under dual-task conditions.

      Older adults (n = 44) who have been referred to physical therapy (PT) for gait or balance
      impairments who have dual-task impairment will be randomized to receive either standard
      balance rehabilitation or balance rehabilitation with dual-task practice. Following PT,
      subjects will receive cognitive training (CT), either speed of processing or generalized
      cognitive training. Primary outcomes are ability to walk while performing four different
      cognitive tasks of varying difficulty. Assessment will occur at baseline, post-PT, post-CT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Scores in Timed up and go With Cognitive Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and go test (TUG) has three conditions: no secondary task (TUG), cognitive (TUGc) and manual dual-tasks (TUG-m). Time to complete the task with the cognitive task was recorded as a primary outcome measure. Time greater than 15 s for TUG-c indicates impaired dual-task ability.</description>

    <measure>Change Scores in Walk While Talk Test With Verbal Fluency Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The walk while talk (WWT) test involves walking at preferred speed while performing a verbal fluency task.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Scores in Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) assesses gait under 8 conditions and has excellent interrater as well as test-retest reliability.
Each of the 8 conditions is scored on a scale from 0 (indicating severe impairment) to 3 (indicating normal ability). The total score is used for statistical analysis with a maximum score of 24 and a minimum score of 0 with a higher score indicating better performance. A total DGI score less than 20 out of 24 indicates fall risk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Scores in Sensory Organization Test (SOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SOT is organized into a series of 6 conditions of increasing difficulty: 3 involve a firm surface with eyes open, eyes closed and with vision sway-referenced and 3 involve a sway-referenced surface with eyes open, eyes closed, and with vision sway-referenced. SOT has good reliability and differentiates fallers and nonfallers.
The SOT composite score is used for statistical analysis with a maximum score of 100 (indicating perfect stability) and a minimum score of 0 (indicating severe instability). Higher scores indicate better performance (i.e., greater postural stability) and SOT composite scores less than 38 out of 100 indicate fall risk.</description>

    <measure>Change Scores in Preferred Gait Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects walk at their preferred speed and time to walk 6 m is recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Scores in Activities-specific Balance-related Confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' decreased confidence in a variety of situations will be measured using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale which has good test-retest reliability. Sixteen activities are each assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater confidence in performing the activity. Item scores are averaged to arrive at a final score, where average scores &lt;67% indicate a greater fall risk.</description>

        <title>Change Scores in Dynamic Gait Index</title>
        <description>Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) assesses gait under 8 conditions and has excellent interrater as well as test-retest reliability.
Each of the 8 conditions is scored on a scale from 0 (indicating severe impairment) to 3 (indicating normal ability). The total score is used for statistical analysis with a maximum score of 24 and a minimum score of 0 with a higher score indicating better performance. A total DGI score less than 20 out of 24 indicates fall risk.</description>

SOT has good reliability and differentiates fallers and nonfallers.
The SOT composite score is used for statistical analysis with a maximum score of 100 (indicating perfect stability) and a minimum score of 0 (indicating severe instability). Higher scores indicate better performance (i.e., greater postural stability) and SOT composite scores less than 38 out of 100 indicate fall risk.</description>

          <title>Change Scores in Activities-specific Balance-related Confidence</title>
          <description>Subjects' decreased confidence in a variety of situations will be measured using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale which has good test-retest reliability. Sixteen activities are each assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater confidence in performing the activity. Item scores are averaged to arrive at a final score, where average scores &lt;67% indicate a greater fall risk.</description>
