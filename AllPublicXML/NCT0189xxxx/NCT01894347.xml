  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-Drug resistant pathogens (MDR) are reported worldwide with increasing incidence,
      especially in intensive care settings.

      One of the drugs which are effective against MDRs, is colistin (polymyxin E). This agent has
      been reintroduced in response to the increase of MDR pathogens and might be used more often
      in the future. Data on safety regarding the most important side effects are not sufficiently
      available. l This study evaluates the toxicity in patients who receive aerosolized colistin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that patients in the ICU setting have a special risk profile for
      consecutive colonization and possible infection due to MDR pathogens.

      One therapy option is the use of inhalative colistin, as this agent has been demonstrated to
      be effective against these pathogens. Data on pharmacodynamics or - kinetics are transferred
      from older studies or from other patient populations. For patients with pulmonary
      colonization or infection due to an MDR pathogen the systemic resorption of the drug is not
      known, consequently systemic side effects including kidney or neural damage are not
      predictable.

      This study focus on patients with inhalative colistin therapy and uses therapeutic drug
      monitoring to determine the rate of systemic resorption of colistin. For the evaluation of
      neurotoxicity function of peripheral nerves (neve conduction velocity) and of the eighth
      cranial nerve is monitored. Nephrotoxicity is estimated by creatinine level (-clearance) and
      the RIFLE criteria.
