      Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agents have become the important ingredients in sunscreen.
      However, there is no histologic study about the effects of anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidative properties of sunscreen to prevent premature aging from UVA and UVB.

      Premature aging can be prevented by using sunscreen. Currently, anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant agents have become the important ingredients in sunscreen. However, there is no
      histologic study about the effects of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of
      sunscreen to prevent premature aging from UVA and UVB.
