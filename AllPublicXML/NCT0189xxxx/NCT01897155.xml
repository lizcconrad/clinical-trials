    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of acute arterial
      hypertension maintained during surgery on morphine's requirements in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high arterial blood pressure has been correlated with an increase in pain threshold in
      animal and humans. One of the explanations to this phenomenon is a baroreceptor activity and
      vasopressin release at the level of spinal cord dorsal horn and hypothalamus.

      As far as we know, there is only one study about the effect of chronic hypertension on
      postoperative pain and none with acute hypertension. We therefore decided to conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acute hypertension on postoperative
      morphine's requirements.

    <description>Induction of anesthesia was performed with remifentanil, pentothal 3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/Kg. Anaesthesia was maintained with remifentanil (0.4 ug/Kg/min) and isoflurane adjusted to bispectral index (40-60). Patients received a phenylephrine infusion to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20% to 30% under baseline. The lower limit of SBP was 75 mmHg. In the recovery room, morphine was administered routinely at doses of 3 mg IV every 15 minutes until pain was less than 4 estimated by visual analog scale (VAS). VAS and pain threshold with von Frey filaments were assessed at 2, 6, 12 and 24 postoperative hours. All patients, received ketorolac 30 mg IV every 8 hours and intravenous morphine administered by patient controlled analgesia system (PCA) during the first 24 hours.</description>
