  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the
      sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter gene (SLC4A5) are associated with hypertension. We tested
      the hypothesis that SNPs in SLC4A5 are associated with salt sensitivity of blood pressure in
      185 whites consuming an isocaloric constant diet with a randomized order of 7 days of low
      sodium (Na+) and 7 days of high Na+ intake. Salt sensitivity was defined as a ≥7-mm Hg
      increase in mean arterial pressure during a randomized transition between low and high Na+
      diet.

      A total of 35 polymorphisms in 17 candidate genes were assayed, 25 of which were tested for
      association. Association analyses with salt sensitivity revealed 3 variants that associated
      with salt sensitivity. Of these, 2 SNPs in SLC4A5 (rs7571842 and rs10177833) demonstrated
      highly significant results and large effects sizes, using logistic regression. These 2 SNPs
      had P values of 1.0×10−4 and 3.1×10−4 with odds ratios of 0.221 and 0.221 in unadjusted
      regression models, respectively, with the G allele at both sites conferring protection. These
      SNPs remained significant after adjusting for body mass index and age (P=8.9×10−5 and
      2.6×10−4 and odds ratios 0.210 and 0.286, respectively). Furthermore, the association of
      these SNPs with salt sensitivity was replicated in a second hypertensive population.
      Meta-analysis demonstrated significant associations of both SNPs with salt sensitivity
      (rs7571842 [P=1.2×10−5]; rs1017783 [P=1.1×10−4]).

      In conclusion, SLC4A5 variants are strongly associated with salt sensitivity of blood
      pressure in 2 separate white populations.

    <textblock>
      Subjects are placed on an isocaloric diet, one week with high sodium(300mEq) and one week
      with low sodium(10mEq), in randomized order. Twenty-four hour urine sodium and urine
      creatinine levels verify diet compliance. Blood pressure measurements are recorded during
      each diet week by automated blood pressure monitoring system. Each blood pressure is taken in
      the right arm 3 times while the subject is sitting quietly for 45 minutes .
