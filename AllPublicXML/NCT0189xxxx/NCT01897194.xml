  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its clinical significance, the pathophysiology of coma is still under investigation
      and the physiology of emergence from coma remains a mystery. Furthermore, predictors of
      emergence from coma, despite their obvious clinical value, remain un-established. Because of
      its low arousal state and hypothesized parallel neurophysiological mechanisms, sleep has been
      studied as both an animal and human model of coma, and awakening from sleep has likewise been
      studied as a surrogate of coma emergence. In this study, we will determine whether certain
      electrographic patterns, known as spectral shifts, which have correlates in normal sleep, are
      predictive of eventual awakening from coma and the time course of this emergence. To detect
      spectral shifts in comatose patients, EEG monitoring must be performed for several days.
      Quick, simple, and reliable EEG recording in the ICU will be enhanced by a small device that
      can be easily and properly positioned on the head by hospital personnel and which lacks
      cumbersome cables or receivers. Traditional EEG monitoring requires placement of up to 25
      wires, which can impede efficient intensive patient care. Our hypothesis is that we can
      detect a difference in spectral shifts in comatose patients who will eventually emerge from
      coma as compared to comatose patients who do not wake up and that a wireless EEG patch-type
      device can effectively make this distinction.

        Inclusion Criteria: All patients with brain injuries admitted to the neurocritical care
        unit will be screened for enrollment. The estimated enrollment will be for 100 patients. 90
        patients will be comatose with Glascow Coma Scale &lt; 9. The other 10 patients will be
        control, non-comatose patients for quality control of the device. Consent for inclusion
        will be obtained from the patient or next of kin for all enrolled patients.
