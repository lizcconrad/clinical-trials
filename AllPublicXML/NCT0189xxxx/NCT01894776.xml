    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are being recruited for this pharmacokinetics study. The objective is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of maraviroc alone and when administered with
      rifabutin and to assess rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin pharmacokinetics compared to
      the literature.
