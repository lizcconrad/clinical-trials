      To provide the IRB approved mechanism for the prospective collection, analysis and reporting
      of data on patients who are undergoing either an autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant for a disease in which a research question is not being addressed and for
      which peer reviewed, published data have demonstrated efficacy for this treatment approach.
