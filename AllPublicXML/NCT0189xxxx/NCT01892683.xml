  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates the relationship between concentrations of the anesthetic drug
      propofol in exhaled breath and blood in patients undergoing general anesthesia for elective
      surgery. The main goal of this study is to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for
      propofol in exhaled breath.

    <textblock>
      Propofol is a hypnotic drug commonly used for induction and maintenance of general
      anesthesia. Propofol is adiministered intravenously and has a comfortable side effect
      profile. Patients recover fast after propofol anesthesia and are less likely to suffer from
      post-operative nausea and vomiting compared to general anesthesia with inhalational
      anesthetics. However, titration of propofol can be challenging and patients may suffer from
      over- or underdosing during propofol anesthesia. Recent work has demonstrated that propofol
      is exhaled during anesthesia. Monitoring of propofol concentrations in breath gas during
      anesthesia may help to titrate propofol anesthesia more effectively. Yet, it is unclear how
      propofol concentrations vary among patients. This study aims to investigate this variation in
      a cohort of patients undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgical procedures. Propofol
      will be measured in breath gas continuously from the induction of anesthesia until recovery.
      Blood samples will be drawn from the start of anesthesia up to 24 h after the end of the
      anesthesia procedure and assayed for propofol blood concentrations. We will built a
      pharmacokinetic model from breath and blood measurements in order to describe the variability
      of propofol breath concentrations among study participants.
