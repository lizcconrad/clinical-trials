    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to implement an optimized perioperative course for patients
      undergoing acute high-risk abdominal surgery in order to improve the outcome.

      The optimized perioperative course consists of a number of interventions carried out before,
      during and after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency surgery is associated with high mortality rates, post-operative complications and
      prolonged duration of hospital admission. The investigators will implement a
      multidisciplinary optimized perioperative course consisting of a number of interventions
      carried out before, during and after surgery.

      Hypothesis: An optimized perioperative course will reduce the 30-day mortality in emergency
      abdominal surgery patients.

      The investigators will do a post-hoc analysis of the data registered.

    <description>AHA (Acute Highrisk Abdominalsurgery): Optimized Course:
Intervention before, during and after abdominal surgery.
Focus on fast track with multimodal standardized intervention:
standardized preparing for surgery including high dose antibiotics and epidural analgesia etc. and transfer to intermediate care before surgery (the post-anaesthesia care unit)
GDT-LiDCO fluid management pre-, per- and postoperative
Postoperative triage to 24 hour intermediate care based on ASA score and Surgical Apgar Score
Focus on early mobilization, fysiotherapy and optimal nutrition postoperatively</description>
