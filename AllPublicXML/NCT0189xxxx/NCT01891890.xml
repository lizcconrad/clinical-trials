  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seizures that arise in specific areas in the brain are called Localization Related Epilepsy
      (LRE) and are the most common seizure disorder in children. Children that receive drug
      treatment for this disorder may suffer from treatment related side effects which impact their
      ability to think or concentrate and their ability to interact socially. These negative
      treatment effects can impact the child's performance in school and long term may impact
      employment and job options.

      This study will determine whether changes in attention and social interactions are seen in
      children treated for LRE using three of the most common medications used to treat pediatric
      LRE. Children who are newly diagnosed with LRE by their doctors and are between the ages of 5
      years 6 months and 16 years 0 months will be randomized to receive levetiracetam,
      lamotrigine, or oxcarbazepine.

      There will be 14 study sites throughout the US. Children will undergo evaluation of their
      thinking and ability to pay attention before and after starting drug treatment for LRE.
      Regardless of the specific findings, results of this study will provide the information
      needed to help parents and their clinicians choose treatment options that maximize cognitive
      abilities in children with LRE, and provide the data needed for practice guidelines to be
      established on the basis of cognitive side effect risks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter, randomized, open-label, central assessor, parallel-group
      study of children ages 5 years, 6 months to 16 years, 0 months with newly diagnosed
      Localization Related Epilepsy (LRE) to establish whether three common antiepileptic drugs
      (AEDs) used as first line LRE treatment (lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), or
      oxcarbazepine (OXC)) are associated with differential cognitive side effects on attention. It
      is predicted that one AED will be identified with greater negative cognitive effects on
      attention. The study will also examine whether there are differential risks for drug-related
      behavior change. The study will address whether 6 month attentional outcomes can be reliably
      predicted based upon shorter term cognitive change assessed soon after beginning AED therapy,
      and establish practice effects associated with repeated test exposure when on constant doses
      of AED.

      Children will undergo cognitive testing after study enrollment and no more than a week after
      AED initiation. Selected measures will be repeated at the first follow up clinic visit after
      beginning AED treatment, and the primary endpoint will be the attention performance obtained
      at the subjects' 6 month follow-up clinic visit.

    <measure>Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) Confidence Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) is a measure of sustained attention. Letters are individually presented on a computer screen, and participants are instructed to press the space bar when they are presented with any letter except the letter &quot;X&quot;. For children younger than 6 years of age at enrollment, the Kiddie CPT will be used in which the child is instructed to press the space bar every time the ball appears on the screen. The outcome measure is a confidence index representing the probability that the respondent has a clinically relevant problem in sustained attention. Possible scores range from 0 to 100. Scores between 40 and 60 are considered inconclusive while scores above 60 indicate that the child exhibits inattentiveness.</description>

    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Behavior Checklist is a measure of specific behavioral and emotional problems are rated by the child's parent or guardian. The Child Behavior Checklist examines three domains (Social Functioning, Mood and Anxiety Symptoms, and Externalizing Symptoms) by assessing 118 problem items that describe specific behavioral and emotional problems. Respondents indicate how accurately the statements describe the child by selecting from options on a 3-point Likert-type scale (0=Not True, 1= Somewhat or Sometimes True, or 2=Very True or Often True). Total raw scores are converted to t-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A t-score of 67 or greater is considered to be in the clinical range for problematic behavior.</description>

    <measure>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV Processing Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Coding and Symbol Search subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-IV are measures of processing speed and combine to form the Processing Speed Index. Processing speed refers to how quickly the child understands and responds to information. Coding presents children with a row of boxes containing a numeral in the top line and a symbol in the bottom line with the task of copying the symbol corresponding to each numeral as quickly as possible in 120 seconds. In Symbol Search, children are given rows of symbols and target symbols and are asked to mark whether or not the target symbols appear in each row as quickly as possible during 120 seconds. Composite scores compare the test-taker to peers with a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Possible scores range from 40 to 160 with higher scores indicating increased processing speeds. Scores between 85 and 115 are considered average, with 2/3 of test takers falling between these values.</description>

    <measure>Story Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Story Memory will be measured at baseline with the Children's Memory Scale (CMS) and then with the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning-2 (WRAML-2) at the 6 month follow up visit. Two different tests are used to avoid practice effects in memory assessment associated with repeated assessments using the same stimulus material. The Story Memory sub-test of the CMS and the WRAML-2 Story Memory are measures of prose passage recall. Stories are read to the subject for recall, with different stories presented based upon participant age. Scores are converted to percentile ranks for both measurements of story memory. Possible scores can fall between the 1st and 99th percentile and higher values indicate better performance with story recall. Values between the 9th and 25 percentiles are considered &quot;low average&quot;, values between the 25th and 75th percentiles are &quot;average&quot;, while values between the 75th and 91st percentile are &quot;high average&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Symbol Digit Modalities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a test of graphomotor speed using numbers as the response rather than copying symbols, and is timed at 90 seconds. The SDMT is designed for people who are 8 years of age and older and detects brain dysfunction as well as measures function over time. Possible total scores range from 0 to 110; where 110 indicates that all values were entered within the 90 second limit. An increase between initial and retest scores indicates that the respondent is correctly matching numbers to symbols at a faster speed. The SDMT was administered at the Month 3 and Month 6 visits for this study.</description>

    <measure>Grooved Pegboard</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Grooved Pegboard assesses fine motor speed and dexterity. The participant fits keyhole-shaped pegs into similarly shaped holes on a square board. The pegs, which have an edge along one side, must be rotated to match the holes before they can be inserted. The scores represent the number of seconds it took for the participant to correctly insert the pegs into the require number of grooves, using their dominant hand.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Participants With a Positive Response on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidal behaviors and suicidal ideation were assessed through an interview using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The C-SSRS guides interviewers to ask a series of simple questions in order to identify people at risk for suicide, as well as the severity and urgency of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The Children's Baseline/Screening C-SSRS was used at the initial study visit while the Children's Since Last Visit C-SSRS was used for subsequent study visits. Any responses of &quot;yes&quot; to the C-SSRS questions are considered a positive response, indicating that the participant is experiencing thoughts of suicide or has exhibited suicidal behaviors.</description>

    <description>The Affective Reactivity Scale is a 7-item survey completed by the child participants which asks questions concerning their level of agreement with statements about anger and irritability. Respondents select between &quot;not true&quot; (scored as 0), &quot;somewhat true&quot; (scored as 1), and &quot;certainly true (scored as 2). Total scores range from 0 to 14 with higher values indicating increased feelings of annoyance and anger.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Neuro-QOL Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Neuro-QOL is a Quality of Life instrument developed in conjunction with NIH with a pediatric specific form utilized in this protocol. Pediatric Neuro-QOL assesses the domains of Anger, Anxiety, Cognition, Depression, Fatigue, Pain, Social Relations, and Stigma. Each domain has 8 to 10 items and respondents indicate how often they experienced feelings and circumstances related to each domain on a scale of 1 to 5 (such as 1=never, 2=almost never, 3=sometimes, 4=often, 5=almost always). Higher values indicate increased difficulty for most of the scales but this pattern is reversed for two of the domains. Raw scores are rescaled to standardized scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher values for the standardized scores indicate more problematic characteristics while scores below 50 indicate that the child is experiencing less trouble in the domains measured by the Pediatric Neuro-QOL.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress Inventory Short Form (PSI-4-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Stress Inventory-4-Short Form is a 36 item questionnaire, completed by the parent/guardian, designed to evaluate parenting and family characteristics based upon child characteristics (behavioral and emotional problems), parent characteristics, and situational/demographic life stress. Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree with a variety of statements by selecting 1=strongly agree, 2=agree, 3=not sure, 4=disagree, or 5=strongly disagree. Raw scores range from 36 to 180 and higher scores are associated with higher parental stress.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Inventory for Parents</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Inventory for Parents consists of 42 items involving communication, medical care, emotional disturbance, and change in role function. Parents respond to a list of difficult events (such as &quot;difficulty sleeping&quot;) that are often experienced by parents of children who are seriously ill. Parents indicated how frequently an event occurred by selecting 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, or 5=Very often. Raw score values range from 4 to 210 with higher scores indicating increased frequency of difficult events.</description>

        <title>Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) Confidence Index</title>
        <description>The Conners’ Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) is a measure of sustained attention. Letters are individually presented on a computer screen, and participants are instructed to press the space bar when they are presented with any letter except the letter &quot;X&quot;. For children younger than 6 years of age at enrollment, the Kiddie CPT will be used in which the child is instructed to press the space bar every time the ball appears on the screen. The outcome measure is a confidence index representing the probability that the respondent has a clinically relevant problem in sustained attention. Possible scores range from 0 to 100. Scores between 40 and 60 are considered inconclusive while scores above 60 indicate that the child exhibits inattentiveness.</description>

        <title>Child Behavior Checklist</title>
        <description>The Child Behavior Checklist is a measure of specific behavioral and emotional problems are rated by the child’s parent or guardian. The Child Behavior Checklist examines three domains (Social Functioning, Mood and Anxiety Symptoms, and Externalizing Symptoms) by assessing 118 problem items that describe specific behavioral and emotional problems. Respondents indicate how accurately the statements describe the child by selecting from options on a 3-point Likert-type scale (0=Not True, 1= Somewhat or Sometimes True, or 2=Very True or Often True). Total raw scores are converted to t-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A t-score of 67 or greater is considered to be in the clinical range for problematic behavior.</description>

        <title>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV Processing Speed</title>
        <description>Coding and Symbol Search subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-IV are measures of processing speed and combine to form the Processing Speed Index. Processing speed refers to how quickly the child understands and responds to information. Coding presents children with a row of boxes containing a numeral in the top line and a symbol in the bottom line with the task of copying the symbol corresponding to each numeral as quickly as possible in 120 seconds. In Symbol Search, children are given rows of symbols and target symbols and are asked to mark whether or not the target symbols appear in each row as quickly as possible during 120 seconds. Composite scores compare the test-taker to peers with a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Possible scores range from 40 to 160 with higher scores indicating increased processing speeds. Scores between 85 and 115 are considered average, with 2/3 of test takers falling between these values.</description>

        <description>Story Memory will be measured at baseline with the Children's Memory Scale (CMS) and then with the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning-2 (WRAML-2) at the 6 month follow up visit. Two different tests are used to avoid practice effects in memory assessment associated with repeated assessments using the same stimulus material. The Story Memory sub-test of the CMS and the WRAML-2 Story Memory are measures of prose passage recall. Stories are read to the subject for recall, with different stories presented based upon participant age. Scores are converted to percentile ranks for both measurements of story memory. Possible scores can fall between the 1st and 99th percentile and higher values indicate better performance with story recall. Values between the 9th and 25 percentiles are considered &quot;low average&quot;, values between the 25th and 75th percentiles are &quot;average&quot;, while values between the 75th and 91st percentile are &quot;high average&quot;.</description>

        <title>Symbol Digit Modalities Test</title>
        <description>Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a test of graphomotor speed using numbers as the response rather than copying symbols, and is timed at 90 seconds. The SDMT is designed for people who are 8 years of age and older and detects brain dysfunction as well as measures function over time. Possible total scores range from 0 to 110; where 110 indicates that all values were entered within the 90 second limit. An increase between initial and retest scores indicates that the respondent is correctly matching numbers to symbols at a faster speed. The SDMT was administered at the Month 3 and Month 6 visits for this study.</description>

        <title>The Number of Participants With a Positive Response on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>Suicidal behaviors and suicidal ideation were assessed through an interview using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The C-SSRS guides interviewers to ask a series of simple questions in order to identify people at risk for suicide, as well as the severity and urgency of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The Children's Baseline/Screening C-SSRS was used at the initial study visit while the Children's Since Last Visit C-SSRS was used for subsequent study visits. Any responses of &quot;yes&quot; to the C-SSRS questions are considered a positive response, indicating that the participant is experiencing thoughts of suicide or has exhibited suicidal behaviors.</description>

        <title>Pediatric Neuro-QOL Score</title>
        <description>The Pediatric Neuro-QOL is a Quality of Life instrument developed in conjunction with NIH with a pediatric specific form utilized in this protocol. Pediatric Neuro-QOL assesses the domains of Anger, Anxiety, Cognition, Depression, Fatigue, Pain, Social Relations, and Stigma. Each domain has 8 to 10 items and respondents indicate how often they experienced feelings and circumstances related to each domain on a scale of 1 to 5 (such as 1=never, 2=almost never, 3=sometimes, 4=often, 5=almost always). Higher values indicate increased difficulty for most of the scales but this pattern is reversed for two of the domains. Raw scores are rescaled to standardized scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher values for the standardized scores indicate more problematic characteristics while scores below 50 indicate that the child is experiencing less trouble in the domains measured by the Pediatric Neuro-QOL.</description>

        <title>Pediatric Inventory for Parents</title>
        <description>The Pediatric Inventory for Parents consists of 42 items involving communication, medical care, emotional disturbance, and change in role function. Parents respond to a list of difficult events (such as &quot;difficulty sleeping&quot;) that are often experienced by parents of children who are seriously ill. Parents indicated how frequently an event occurred by selecting 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, or 5=Very often. Raw score values range from 4 to 210 with higher scores indicating increased frequency of difficult events.</description>

        <population>The analysis includes participants who completed the assessment at the specified study visit. Some parents attended a study visit but did not complete the Pediatric Inventory for Parents.</population>

      <time_frame>Information about adverse events experienced by participants was collected from the time the participant began taking the randomized study drug through 30 days after the last study visit.</time_frame>
      <desc>An adverse event (AE) is an unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, sign, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the study intervention. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are untoward medical occurrence resulting in death, are life-threatening, require or prolong hospitalization, cause disability/incapacity, result in birth defects, or represent other significant hazards. For this study, elective hospitalizations unrelated to epilepsy will not be considered SAEs.</desc>
