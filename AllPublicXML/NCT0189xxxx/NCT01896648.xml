  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming an increasingly problem for public health and it is
      related with various complications such as sexual problems. The prevalence of erectile
      dysfunction has been widely studied in men as a complication of diabetes; the prevalence of
      sexual dysfunction in women, instead, has not been well investigated. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in type 2 diabetic women using
      international validated questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an estimated temporal space of about 3 years, 306 women will be recruited consecutively.

      After collection of written informed consent, the following data will be collected:

        -  History: type of diabetes, comorbidities, current medication, duration of diabetes and
           complications, voluptuary habits such as tobacco smoke (both number of packets/year and
           nÂ° packets/day), alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, physical activity.

        -  Physical exam, general anthropometric parameters such as weight, height, circumference,
           body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and blood pressure.

        -  Assessment of glycemic variability (fasting plasma glucose and post-prandial glucose)

        -  Each patient will be self-administered Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Female
           Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) questionnaires to assess the prevalence of sexual
           dysfunction and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS)
           of Zung for an accurate assessment of the state of anxiety and depression.

        -  We will collect blood and urine samples to assess: ematology, glycated hemoglobin,
           fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
           triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, creatinine, urea, transaminases, electrolytes, complete
           urinalysis, 24-hour microalbuminuria, homocysteine, high sensitivity C-reactive protein
           (hs-CRP), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), soluble adhesion
           molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1), sE-selectin, lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)], Plasminogen
           Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).

        -  We will also conduct a clinical and instrumental exam of the foot using Neuropad,
           recently validated as a screening tool for diabetic neuropathy. Patients will also
           undergo autonomic tests (deep breathing, lying to standing, Valsalva maneuver, and
           orthostatic hypotension).

      We will also evaluate the presence of neuropathy through the administration of the Michigan
      Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) and the Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS).

    <description>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19-item questionnaire, developed as a brief, multidimensional self-report instrument for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function in women.</description>

    <description>We will consider the following risk factors:
Smoking status; Consume of alcohol; Obesity; Hepatic steatosis; Hypertension; Dyslipidemia; Chronic ischemic disease; Hyperuricemia; Chronic kidney disease; Retinopathy; Neuropathy; Vasculopathy.
Correlations between sexual dysfunction and single risk factors will be analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient r.</description>

    <description>The presence of diabetic neuropathy will be assessed using dysautonomic tests (deep breathing, lying to standing, Valsalva maneuver e orthostatic hypotension).
The prevalence of symmetric distal neuropathy will be assessed using:
the Neuropad test, developed as a simple visual indicator test to evaluate diabetic neuropathy
the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI)
the Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS) The correlation will be analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient r</description>
