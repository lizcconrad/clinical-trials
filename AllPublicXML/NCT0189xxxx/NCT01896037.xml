  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with a spinal cord injury (SCI) characteristically have low levels of high-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c; &quot;good cholesterol&quot;) and high levels of low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c; &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;), and are at a higher risk of developing
      cardiovascular health problems, such as heart disease, heart attack and stroke, than the
      able-bodied population. A common way for able-bodied people to improve their lipid profile is
      through exercise; however, SCI people, especially tetraplegics, are often unable to achieve
      and maintain a level of exercise needed to obtain these benefits. It is therefore clinically
      important to find an effective, safe and inexpensive method of increasing HDL-c levels in
      people with chronic tetraplegia. This study will investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty
      acid supplementation on the lipid profile of people with tetraplegia. The investigators
      hypothesize that 5 months of daily consumption of high doses of omega-3 fatty acids will
      increase plasma levels of HDL-c in those with tetraplegia, leading to decreased risk of
      cardiovascular health issues.
