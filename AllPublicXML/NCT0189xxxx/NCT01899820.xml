  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended for use against uncomplicated
      malaria in areas of multi-drug resistant malaria. The Ministry of Health, Division of Malaria
      Control (DOMC) rolled out the use of artemether-lumefantrine as the first line treatment for
      uncomplicated malaria in 2006.The development of the ACTs and its derivatives are the most
      rapidly acting of all the current antimalarial drugs and recognition of their potential role
      as a component of combination therapy have led to several large trials aimed at assessing
      different combinations of existing drugs, and to the specific development of new combination
      drugs.

      This proposal aims to (1) evaluate the efficacy of artemisinin-based anti-malaria combination
      drugs in different sites across Kenya (2) elucidate the markers of resistance to ACTs through
      molecular genetics and in this process further strengthen capacity in the proposed study
      sites as well as improve links between research and control ultimately to influence malaria
      treatment policy and practice.

      Five groups in East Africa will conduct a multi-centre, randomised, two arm trial to assess
      the efficacy of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine with artemether-lumefantrine as the comparative
      drug. The network will determine antimalarial drug efficacy using standardised protocols and
      collate clinical responses and adverse events. Molecular markers to artemisinin resistance
      will be investigated by molecular sequencing and comparison of parasite profiles in drug
      failure cases. Recrudescence or re-infections will be differentiated by analysis of the MSP1,
      MSP2 and GLURP genes and assess transmission dynamics post treatment. Data from these studies
      will be captured into a database developed by the network. The latter offers several
      advantages including

        -  Working towards the standardization of methodologies and common protocols as a way of
           comparing data across sites

        -  Pulling together datasets and conduct a multi-centre analysis

        -  Sharing and coordinating quality assurance mechanisms

    <description>ACPR is defined as the absence of parasitaemia on day 42 irrespective of the temperature without previously meeting any of the criteria of early treatment failure or late clinical or parasitological failure.
Patients with late asexual parasite reappearance will be considered ACPR if the CR analyses shows a new infection rather than a recrudescence (through PCR genotyping).
The total treatment failure is defined according to the WHO criteria as the sum of early and late treatment failures.</description>
