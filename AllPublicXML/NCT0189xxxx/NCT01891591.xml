    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing how Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGP) impacts on energy and
      nutrients' intake, energy expenditure, and nutritional status in obese patients. It will try
      quantitate energy and protein balance after RYGP, and to identify how RYGP effects the intake
      of various common dietary protein sources 16 female patients with BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 and on a
      waiting list for bariatric surgery will be included. The following measurements will be
      performed before, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months after RYGP

        -  body weight

        -  body composition (bio impedancemetry)

        -  basal metabolic rate (open circuit indirect calorimetry)

        -  24-hour urinary urea excretion

        -  fasting blood chemistry

        -  energy and macronutrient's intake (3-day dietary recall)
