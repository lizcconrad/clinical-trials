  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal is to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions which drive the
      development of antibiotic resistance in the community. The primary objective of ABACOPD is to
      demonstrate in a sufficiently sized clinical study that there is no relevant increase in the
      &quot;failure-rate&quot; for patients with acute moderate exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) treated with
      placebo instead of antibiotic treatment both on top of standard of care. A patient is
      classified as treatment failure if additional antibiotic therapy is required during treatment
      period or until the test of cure visit (TOC at day 30, primary endpoint).

    <description>Assessment of additional antibiotic therapy:
Patients will be asked at every visit about use of additional antibiotic therapy. In the case of use of additional antibiotic therapy the exact starting date, the active compound, the dose administered, the route of administration,the length of treatment and the indication will be registered. Only additional antibiotic therapy for AE-COPD will be counted as treatment failure.</description>
