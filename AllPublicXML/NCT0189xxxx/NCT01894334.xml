  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity rate of Stanford A type Acute Aortic Dissection（AAD） has been increasing, about
      5-10/100,000* per year. Emergency surgery has been the main treatment for Acute Aortic
      Dissection, however perioperative mortality rate can be as high as 15~30%. Acute lung injury
      (ALI) is one of the main complications that happen during the perioperative period, which by
      itself covers 30%-50% of the overall mortality rate. Both domestic and foreign countries lack
      researches on risk factors, pathogenesis, disease progression and outcome of ALI, which
      happen during the perioperative period of Acute Aortic Dissection patients.

      This topic study follow projects in the preoperative of Acute Aortic Dissection'surgery

        1. hemodynamic changes (aortic dissection resulting in acute aortic regurgitation, cardiac
           tamponade and proximal high blood pressure)

        2. ischemia - reperfusion injury of aortic dissection distal organ

        3. Aortic intima-media exposure cause coagulation / fibrinolytic system function disorder

        4. systemic inflammatory response syndrome; use relevant clinical radiographic parameters,
           indicators of respiratory mechanics (oxygenation index and lung injury index) and
           biochemical indicators.

      To discuss risk factors and possible mechanisms of ADD patients with pre-operative ALI and
      observe their influences on the progress and prognosis of AAD, to explore early intervention
      in the preoperative for possible risk factors and mechanisms and to evaluate their influences
      on the prognosis, to achieve the purpose of reducing AAD perioperative mortality of ALI and
      medical expenses.
