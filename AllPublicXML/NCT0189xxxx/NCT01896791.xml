    <textblock>
      Climacteric or Menopausal Transition is defined as the time period where there is a change to
      non-reproductive reproductive life, with extension of variable length. During this period,
      and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance of
      various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these
      symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In
      addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve
      these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical
      impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of
      alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale
      for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic
      modulatory effect. What reinforces the choice of this technique is the fact that it
      demonstrated efficacy in other pathologies such as depression, pain, Parkinson's disease,
      among others. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a renewed method of
      non-invasive brain modulation. It is based on a transcranial application of weak direct
      currents in a non-invasive, simple and painless manner. Its use in the treatment of vasomotor
      symptoms has not been studied. The objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement of
      vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women, after application of tDCS, and compare them to a
      control group. This Randomized Clinical Trial will be held in female postmenopausal patients,
      followed in the outpatient Menopause Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Service, Hospital de
      Clinicas de Porto Alegre. From these results, it is expected to present a new therapeutic
      option in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.

      Primary Outcome: evaluate the effect of tDCS on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women
      treated at a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil.

      Secondary Outcome: compare the effect of tDCS with sham-tDCS in postmenopausal women on
      vasomotor symptoms, FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) levels, salivary cortisol, BDNF
      (Brains derived neurotrophic factor)levels,depressive symptoms and quality of life.

      Interventions:

        -  Application of tDCS for a period of 10 consecutive days.

        -  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS):

      Active stimulation: the anode electrode is placed in the area of the motor cortex M1 C3 or C4
      position of the dominant hemisphere (International 10-20 EEG System). The cathode electrode
      is placed over the contralateral supraorbital region to the anode electrode. Treatment time
      and intensity of the stimulus: 2 mili Ampere, 20min, 10 days.

      Placebo-sham: appliance off during the entire period without active stimulation, with the
      position of the electrodes in the same sites of active stimulation.

      The placebo group do not receive pharmacological treatment or other during the research.

      After treatment, patients will be reassessed in a week, a month and three months with new
      application of questionnaires and sample collection.
