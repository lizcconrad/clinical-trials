  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single session of aerobic plus
      resistance exercises on the vascular function of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The
      investigators hypothesize that a single aerobic exercise session would promote greater
      benefit in vascular function of patients with type 1 diabetes, as compared with the resistive
      exercise session.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of endurance and resistance exercises on
      endothelial function in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). For this purpose, the
      sample size will consist of 15 patients with DM1, aged between 18 and 45 years, which will
      undertake the two types of exercises, randomly distributed. Ergospirometry testing will be
      performed in order to assess possible contraindications to the proposed protocol as well as
      functional capacity, which will be used in prescription of the endurance exercise session.
      Similarly, a strength maximal testing will be conducted and used in the prescription of the
      resistance exercise session.

      The endothelial function will be evaluated by vascular reactivity of the forearm and
      circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) counting. To analyze the vascular reactivity
      of the forearm, non-invasive venous occlusion plethysmography will be used, whereas flow
      cytometry method will be used to the analysis of the number of circulating EPC. The endurance
      exercise session will consist of 40 minutes of cycling on heart rate corresponding to 60% of
      VO2 max. The resistance exercise session will last 40 minutes, consisting of 4 sets of 12
      repetitions at 60% of 1RM, in four exercises for lower limbs. The research will be performed
      at the Exercise Pathophysiology Research Laboratory of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto
      Alegre. The investigators expect to find greater increase in the number of circulating EPC
      after the endurance exercise session, when compared to the benefits obtained from a session
      of resistance exercise. Likewise, it is expected to find greater benefits in relation to
      vascular reactivity of the forearm after a session of endurance exercise when compared to a
      session of resistance exercise. Considering that most part of the studies that analyze the
      effects of physical exercise on vascular function does not involve patients with DM1, this
      project aims to provide a clearer picture of the benefits of different exercises in the acute
      response of endothelial function in these patients.

    <description>A 20-ml sodium heparin tube will be used and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque. Blood samples will be diluted with PBS and layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque in 15-ml tubes. Tubes will be centrifuged at 400 g for 30 min and the PBMC at the interface will be collected. Cells will be washed with RPMI 1640 medium and thereafter stained with 5 µl of anti-CD45-FITC , 8 µl of anti-KDR-Alexa Fluor 647, and 5 µl of anti-CD34-PE (all essays from BD, Biosciences, USA). Thereafter, 50 µl of resuspended cells will be incubated (30 min), and subsequently, 500 µl of PBS will be added for acquisition. A FACS Calibur flow cytometer will be used with Quest software (BD Biosciences, USA) equipped with 22 mW argon laser tuned at 488 nm, with a total number counted cells of 200,000 on mononuclear cells gate per sample. Percentage of CD34 positive cells will be calculated based on the number of leukocytes .</description>

    <description>Forearm blood flow and reactive hyperemia:
Forearm blood flow will be measured by venous occlusion plethysmography (D.E Hokanson, USA) at the nondominant forearm. A rapid inflator cuff will be used in the upper arm to occlude venous outflow (50-60 mmHg), and three blood flow recordings will be made each minute during 3 minutes. Thereafter, reactive hyperemia will be measure using an occlusion at 250 mmHg for 5 min, which will be released by 10 seconds intervals for 2 minutes. Reactive hyperemia will be calculated using the peak blood flow after the 5 minutes the occlusion.</description>
