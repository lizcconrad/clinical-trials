  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to measure the frequency and clinical types of mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) or dementia that occur among up to 150 military retirees with and without a
      history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home,
      Washington D.C. and the Veterans Home of California-Yountville. Investigators will compare
      the characteristics of dementia in those who have had a prior TBI to the characteristics in
      those without a history of TBI. It is our hypothesis that the dementia or MCI among those
      with prior TBI has distinct neuropsychological features that distinguishes it from those with
      dementia or MCI without a history of TBI.

      75 participants with a history of TBI will be the cases (exposed) group. A control group of
      75 retirement home residents without a history of TBI who are age-matched to the cases will
      also be recruited. Participants will be evaluated in a single visit, which will include
      neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive assessment. The evaluation will take approximately 4
      hours. In some cases, the evaluation may be split into two 2 hour sessions.

        Subjects for this study will be recruited from the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) in
        Washington, DC and the Veterans Home of California- Yountville. Up to 150 AFRH residents
        from both the independent living and the assisted living facilities will be invited to take
        the screening questionnaire and enroll in the study.
