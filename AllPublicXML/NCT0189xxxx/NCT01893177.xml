    <time_frame>Day 22 +/- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity variables are analyzed according to the EMA re-licensing criteria; at least one of the criteria has to be fulfilled for each vaccine strain:
Seroconversion rate at Day 22 has to be &gt;40% of subjects aged ≥18 to ≤60 years and &gt;30% of subjects aged &gt;60 years, or
Seroprotection rate at Day 22 has to be &gt;70% of subjects aged ≥18 to ≤60 years and &gt;60% of subjects aged &gt;60 years, or
GMT-fold increase at Day 22 compared to baseline: a &gt;2.5-fold increase has to be reached in subjects aged ≥18 to ≤60 years and a &gt;2.0-fold increase has to be reached in subjects aged &gt;60 years</description>
