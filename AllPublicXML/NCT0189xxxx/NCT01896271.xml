  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this i-SABR (immunotherapy + Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation) trial, the stereotactic
      radiation to multiple metastatic sites is delivered not only to eradicate sites of bulky
      progressive disease, but also to provide antigen presentation and immune stimulation which is
      expected to act synergistically when immediately followed by the non-specific immune
      stimulation provided by treatment with HD IL-2 and thereby increase the response rate and
      complete response for metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer patients. Both HD IL-2 and SABR
      are FDA approved therapeutic cancer treatment

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy-proven metastatic clear cell RCC.

          2. Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. 2.1 Patients with any number of
