      This study examined whether the Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument for the
      Emergency Department (PACCI-ED), a 12-item questionnaire, can help doctors in the emergency
      department accurately assess a child's asthma control.

      This study involved an intervention with the doctors in the emergency department of an urban
      pediatric hospital. The intervention was done when one of the doctors involved in the study
      treated a child aged 1-17 years for an asthma exacerbation. Parents answered questions on the
      PACCI-ED about their children's asthma. Half of the doctors were allowed to see the PACCI-ED
      results and half were not. The two groups of doctors were compared on their ability to
      correctly identify asthma control categories, whether a child's asthma was worsening or
      improving, whether the family was administering controller medications as often as they
      should, and how much burden the child's asthma was for the family.

    <description>Attending physician answered &quot;Which of the following best describes this patient's asthma control over the past 12 months?&quot; (RESPONSES: Controlled, partly controlled, mildly uncontrolled, moderately uncontrolled, severely uncontrolled).

Responses were compared to equivalent categories of medication adherence based on PACCI algorithm.</description>
