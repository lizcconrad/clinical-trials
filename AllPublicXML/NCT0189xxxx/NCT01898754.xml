  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to gauge improvements in the rate of durable suppression of viral
      replication by ART when OLA is used to guide clinical decisions at the PEPFAR Coptic Hope
      Center in Kenya, and to determine the cost-effectiveness of implementing this strategy at
      Coptic Hope Center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durable suppression of HIV replication is critical to (1) improving the health of infected
      individuals, (2) to reducing HIV transmission to sexual partners and from mothers to their
      infants, and (3) to maintaining the effectiveness of the current 1st-line non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)- based ART. Across multiple trials, individuals with
      NNRTI-resistance, even at low-concentrations, have substantially greater virologic failure
      when treated with NVP- vs PI-ART. A cost-effective strategy is needed to detect and manage
      ARV-resistant HIV infections. A simple low-cost innovative assay the investigators developed
      and successfully transferred to Asian and African countries (oligonucleotide ligation assay
      (OLA)) can detect NNRTI+lamivudine (3TC) resistant HIV using reagents that costs
      &lt;$7.00/person. Furthermore, detection of NNRTI-resistance by OLA is highly (P&lt;0.001)
      associated with virologic failure of nevirapine (NVP)-ART in two retrospective studies; one
      of Thai women who had been previously randomized to single-dose NVP and the second of
      ARV-naïve Kenyan adults.

      The investigators hypothesize that implementation of OLA into routine care will allow Kenyan
      clinicians to appropriately target protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART and improve rates of
      durable suppression of viral replication, and thus improve CD4 cell gains and individuals'
      health, reduce the transmission of ARV-resistant HIV within the community, and maintain the
      utility of NNRTI-ART. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that programmatically
      OLA-guided ART will be more cost-efficient compared to the current strategy of empiric use of
      NNRTI-ART as initial treatment.
