  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is frequently used for pediatric anesthesia because it has low pungency and rapid
      onset and offset of action.The reported incidence of emergence agitation (EA) following
      sevoflurane anesthesia varies from 10-80%. Despite its spontaneous resolution, EA is still
      considered as a potentially serious complication because of the risks of self-injury, and
      because of the stress caused to both caregivers and families.

      Dexmedetomidine, an Alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic
      actions, has been used in pediatric populations.Several prospective clinical trials in
      children have shown that dexmedetomidine significantly reduces the incidence of EA prior to
      recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. However, the effect of dexmedetomidine premedication on
      emergence agitation has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of the present study was to
      verify the hypothesis that intranasal premedication with dexmedetomidine is effective in
      reducing emergence agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia.

      Emergence agitation was assessed using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)
      scale.The PAED scale contains five items (eye contact, purposefulness of actions,awareness of
      surroundings, restlessness and consolability), each scored on a 0 to 4 scale, for a maximum
      of 20 points.

      A perfectly calm child scores 0 and extreme agitation corresponds to 20 points. The peak EA
      score was recorded. Agitation scores &lt; 10 were interpreted as an absence of agitation,
      scores&gt;= 10 were regarded as presence of agitation.
