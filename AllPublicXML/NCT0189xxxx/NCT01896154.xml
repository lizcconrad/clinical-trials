  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to estimate the effect size of a 5-week consumption period of
      different dietary non-digestible polysaccharides (NPS) on antibody response to influenza
      vaccination and cellular immunity of healthy volunteers (aged ≥ 50) for clarifying whether
      these NPS may enable enhancement of immune defence and to estimate the sample size for a
      confirmative trial. Furthermore the effects on faecal microbiota and its metabolites will be
      investigated.

      The study is conducted in the frame of the collaborative project 'FibeBiotics' (Nr. 289517)
      (Fibers as support of the Gut and Immune function of Elderly - From polysaccharide compound
      to health claim) within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for Research and Technological
      Development of the European Union (EU).
