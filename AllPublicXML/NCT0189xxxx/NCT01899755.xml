  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2800528 is being developed as a human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) for the treatment of immune-inflammatory diseases. The study will be conducted
      in healthy volunteers and divided into 4 cohorts. Cohorts 1 to 3 will consist of groups of 12
      subjects, 9 on active treatment (GSK2800528), and 3 on placebo. Cohort 4 will consist of a
      group of 9 subjects, all on active treatment (adalimumab).

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 3 months, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.
