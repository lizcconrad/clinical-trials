      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Iguratimod versus placebo on
      synovial inflammation,bone erosion and bone edema as measured by MRI of wrist and
      Metacarpophalangeal joints in patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging modality that is now widely used in
      both scientific research and clinical settings to visualise joints of patients with RA. MRI
      is able to image structural damage and soft tissue changes, ie, synovitis, bone oedema,
      damage to cartilage and bone, as well as tendon pathology. MRI is more responsive to change
      in joint damage and can be used to monitor disease progression.

      In this studly,MRI of the dominant wrist was performed at baseline ,24 weeks and at 52 weeks,
      using a 1.5T or 3.0T MRI with a dedicated high-resolution wrist phased array coil.The same
      scanner and wrist coil were used for three examinations. The hand was placed in the wrist
      coil at the patient's side with the coil anchored to the base tray to reduce motion
      artefacts. The MRI sequences in this study included the OMERACT recommended MRI core set of
      sequences.
