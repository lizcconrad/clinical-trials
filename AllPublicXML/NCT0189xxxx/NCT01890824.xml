  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following chemotherapy, breast cancer patients primarily gain fat mass and lose muscle mass.
      Both depletion of muscle and an increase of fat mass in breast cancer patients are related to
      short survival, and decreased skeletal muscle mass and function may result in fatigue and
      inactivity, which contributes to fat mass changes and can be responsible for chemo-toxicity
      and increased mortality. The purpose of this study is to provide detailed insight in
      chemotherapy related changes in lipid metabolism and gut digestion and absorption of fat in
      breast cancer patients compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide required
      information that is necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal nutritional
      regimen in breast cancer patients. The hypothesis is that chemotherapy in breast cancer is
      related to altered gut function and absorption and to increases in fat synthesis that lead to
      fat accumulation. In addition, we will examine the effect of cancer, chemotherapy, and gender
      by comparing fat digestion/absorption and fat metabolism of the breast cancer before and
      after chemotherapy, to aged matched healthy female and male controls.

      This research study involves 5 visits for the breast cancer subjects and 3 visits for the
      healthy controls. The first visit includes the informed consent and a screening and the
      second and third visit for the study days before chemotherapy and the fourth and fifth visit
      for the study days after chemotherapy. For the first test day, 2 hours of the subjects time
      will be for urine and blood sample collection, and to ingest the deuterated water. Subjects
      are allowed to go home after and eat normally. On the second study day, subjects will arrive
      early that morning and a DXA scan will be performed first. For the duration of the study,
      subjects have to lie in the bed (except for bathroom privileges). They can watch tv or bring
      and use a book/tablet. The research nurse or study staff will be present in the human subject
      area to assist the subject if necessary. Subjects are not allowed to eat or drink during the
      second test day, except for the test drink (meal) and water. One IV catheter will be placed
      in a vein of the arm/hand for blood draws. The hand will be placed in a hot box during blood
      collection. Another IV catheter will be placed in the contra-lateral forearm for a primed and
      continuous infusion of 2H5-glycerol. Over the two day time period, a total of 100-120 ml of
      blood will be obtained over approximately 19 samples. Stable isotopes will be ingested on the
      first test day, added to the test drinks on the second test day after the second hour, and
      infused on the second day. On the second test day, subjects will fill out questionnaires and
      perform muscle function tests. After completion of the study, we will provide the subject
      with a meal.

        Subjects with breast cancer will be recruited when visiting a medical or cancer clinic in
        and outside the surrounding area of College Station. Cancer patients and healthy subjects
        will also be recruited by responding to distributed flyers in the community in the College
        Station area; for example in hospital/clinic waiting areas, clinic rooms and bulletin
        boards at Scott &amp; White and the CSMC or any other hospital. Other general recruitment
        material in relation to the nutrition research that the research group performs at Texas
        A&amp;M can be placed on bulletin boards at Scott &amp; White and the CSMC.
