      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      single-dose, 5-treatment, 5-period, 5-way crossover study in pediatric patients with
      persistent asthma. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      Albuterol Spiromax with that of ProAir HFA in pediatric asthma patients at 2 delivered dose
      levels equivalent to 90 mcg and 180 mcg of albuterol base.

    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening visit (SV) followed by up to 16 days by a treatment period
      comprising 5 visits (TV1-TV5). The treatment period visits will each be separated by a
      washout period lasting 2-7 days. During each treatment period visit, the forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be determined at 30 minutes and again immediately prior to the
      commencement of study medication administration, and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300,
      and 360 minutes after completion of study medication administration.

    <time_frame>Treatment visits 1-5 (approximately days 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21); -35 and -5 minutes prior to dosing and 5 (±2), 15 (±5), 30 (±5), 45 (±5), 60 (±5), 120 (±5), 180 (±5), 240 (±5), 300 (±5), and 360 (±5) minutes after the completion of study drug administrati</time_frame>
    <description>Percent predicted FEV1: measured FEV1 as a percent of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for the patients of similar characteristics. Predicted FEV1 values were computed and adjusted for age, height, and gender for patients aged 4-5 years (Eigen et al 2001) and for patients aged 6-11 years (Quanjer et al 1995) using ATS/European Thoracic Society (ERS) criteria applicable to pediatric patients (ATS/ERS 2007).
The percent predicted FEV1 (PPFEV1) area under the curve (AUC)0-6 was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule, and baseline adjustment was made by subtracting the average of the 2 pre-dose PPFEV1 values from each post-dose PPFEV1 determination.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) summarized in this table are those that began or worsened after treatment with study drug (treatment-emergent AEs). An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator as mild (no limitation of usual activities), moderate, or severe (inability to carry out usual activities).
Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Of the 102 patients screened, 61 patients at 14 centers in the US met entry criteria and were considered to be eligible for enrollment into the study. 41 patients were not enrolled: 33 were excluded due to inclusion criteria, 1 patient withdrew consent, 3 patients were lost to follow-up before the baseline visit, and 4 patients for other reasons.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 fashion into 10 treatment sequences with 6 participants in 9 of the sequences and 7 participants in the remaining sequence.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Percent predicted FEV1: measured FEV1 as a percent of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for the patients of similar characteristics. Predicted FEV1 values were computed and adjusted for age, height, and gender for patients aged 4-5 years (Eigen et al 2001) and for patients aged 6-11 years (Quanjer et al 1995) using ATS/European Thoracic Society (ERS) criteria applicable to pediatric patients (ATS/ERS 2007).
The percent predicted FEV1 (PPFEV1) area under the curve (AUC)0-6 was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule, and baseline adjustment was made by subtracting the average of the 2 pre-dose PPFEV1 values from each post-dose PPFEV1 determination.</description>

        <title>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</title>
        <description>Adverse events (AEs) summarized in this table are those that began or worsened after treatment with study drug (treatment-emergent AEs). An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator as mild (no limitation of usual activities), moderate, or severe (inability to carry out usual activities).
Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>
