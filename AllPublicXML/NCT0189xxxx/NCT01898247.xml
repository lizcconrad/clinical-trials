  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the use a medical simulation and mastery
      learning (where all learners must reach a high standard before completion of training)
      curriculum to improve internal medicine residents' skills when performing thoracentesis
      procedures (remove fluid from around the lung) on patients. Additionally, we will evaluate
      how these skills affect patient outcomes by comparing thoracenteses performed by
      simulator-trained residents to those who have &quot;traditional&quot; training. This project will
      evaluate these overall hypotheses: simulation-based training using the mastery learning
      approach improves medicine resident's thoracentesis skills and improves patient outcomes and
      satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given medical procedures are the second most common cause of the complications that afflict
      3% of hospitalized patients, simulation-based mastery learning should be applied to
      procedures done in all medical centers. In academic hospitals, bedside procedures such as
      thoracentesis procedures are often performed by unsupervised medical trainees. Traditionally,
      medical trainees learn procedures relying on the historic &quot;see one, do one, teach one&quot;
      mentality. Unfortunately, this approach subjects patients to procedures before trainees are
      competent.

      Through the use of medical simulation, medical educators can increase the essential knowledge
      and skills of trainees while assuring procedural competence and reducing patient exposure to
      undue risk. Medical simulation training using the mastery learning model improves clinical
      skills and reduces the risk of procedure-associated injury. Our research group pioneered the
      use of this evidence-based approach for teaching medical trainees. Mastery learning requires
      that all trainees demonstrate a uniformly high level of skill before training completion.
      This ensures competence on a medical simulator before actual patient encounters.

    <description>Thoracentesis skills will be measured using a checklist on the simulator and on actual patients during direct observations. Satisfaction with procedures done by a referred service or at the bedside by simulator-trained residents will be measured by patient reported confidence levels in procedure performer, perception of delay, and comfort during the procedure. Patient safety will be measured by assessing documented complication rates such as: pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and significant pain. Additionally, length of stay and hospital costs will be compared between patients undergoing thoracentesis by simulator-trained residents versus referred services (or traditionally-trained residents).</description>
