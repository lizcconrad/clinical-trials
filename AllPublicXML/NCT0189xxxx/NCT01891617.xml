  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine whether the mid-day suppression of hunger and amplified increase in the release of
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) following
      morning exercise is due to increased fat content of the diet per se or a combination of high
      fat diet after morning exercise. The action of gut peptides, particularly GLP-1, on gastric
      emptying is likely to be important in mediating its effects on postprandial appetite and
      glycemia (Nauck et al. 1997). Our hypothesis is that exercise amplifies gut peptide secretion
      when diet is enriched with fat, and that this stimulus suppresses the hunger sensation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific aim: Determine whether a change in macronutrient composition from 60% carbohydrate
      and 25% fat to 30% carbohydrate and 45% fat is responsible by itself for suppression of
      hunger and increased secretory response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic hormone (GIP) and
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), or whether these changes depend on preceding exercise. We
      will measure (a) concentrations of plasma GIP and GLP-1 by chemiluminescent multiplex assay,
      (b) concentrations of plasma ancetaminophen to assess the gastric emptying rate, (c)
      concentrations of plasma insulin, and glucagon by radioimmunoassay, and glucose, ketone
      bodies, and free fatty acids with appropriate spectrophotometric methods, (d) hourly appetite
      responses with visual analog scale under two conditions: sedentary (SED) and exercise (EX).

      Hypothesis: Hunger suppression and secretion of GIP and GLP-1 after the morning meal will be
      greater with slower gastric emptying rate when a meal consisting of 45% fat and 30%
      carbohydrate follows three hours after a 2-hour bout of moderate-intensity exercise than in
      the absence of exercise.
