  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific goal of this research study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary efficacy of a transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral therapy developed
      specifically to target common core processes across mood and anxiety disorders [Unified
      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP)], for the treatment of
      patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) and comorbid anxiety. The study will compare
      treatment-as-usual with pharmacotherapy (TAU) plus 18 one-hour sessions of treatment with the
      UP to TAU alone. Patients in both treatment conditions will be followed over a 12-month
      period and will be assessed monthly to track changes in mood, anxiety and emotion-related
      symptoms; functional impairment; and relapse rates. Data on the acceptability of the
      treatment will be gathered concurrently through monthly patient self-reported ratings of
      treatment satisfaction, and by tracking rates of acceptance for randomization into the study,
      number of completed sessions, and dropout rates. The study will examine: 1) whether combined
      cognitive behavioral treatment (UP) for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders is an acceptable
      and feasible approach to treatment; 2) whether treatment with the UP for BD-I and comorbid
      anxiety disorders as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) leads to greater
      symptom reduction and reduced functional impairment than pharmacotherapy alone, 3) whether
      treatment for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders with the UP improves relapse rates over a
      6-month follow-up relative to TAU; and 4) whether reduction in symptoms, relapse rates, and
      functional impairment are mediated by changes in emotion regulation skills. The broader aim
      of this study is to address the need for improved treatments for bipolar disorder.

    <measure>Reductions Over Time in Anxiety Symptoms as Measured by Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a well-validated clinician administered rating of anxiety-related symptoms. Ratings are made on a 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (most severe in frequency/duration/interference/distress) for each item (14 items), with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 56 calculated by summing scores of all 14 items. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reductions Over Time in Depression Symptoms as Measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a well-validated clinician administered rating of depression-related symptoms. Scores are calculated by summing scores across all 17-items, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 54. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Acceptability as Measured by Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is an 8-item scale that assesses perceptions of acceptability and quality of outpatient treatment. Ratings are made on a 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) scale for each item and then summed for a total score, with a minimum score of 8 and a maximum score of 32. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

    <measure>Association Between Anxiety Symptom Change (HAM-A) and Neuroticism (NEO Five-Factor Inventory- NEO-FFI-N)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuroticism was assessed using the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI-N) which is a subscale of the NEO-FFI, a 60-item Likert-type scale (1-5) calculated by summing scores for each subscale. Only the 15-item Neuroticism subscale is included in this study. See Baseline Characteristics for baseline NEO-FFI-N. See Primary Outcome Measure for description of HAM-A.</description>

    <measure>Association Between Change on Depression (HAM-D) and Baseline Resting State Functional Connectivity of Anterior Insula and Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data (non-task, eyes opened) was acquired to investigate anterior insula and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity as a predictor of change on depression (HAM-D).

        <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is an 8-item scale that assesses perceptions of acceptability and quality of outpatient treatment. Ratings are made on a 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) scale for each item and then summed for a total score, with a minimum score of 8 and a maximum score of 32. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>
