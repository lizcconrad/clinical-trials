      The main objective of this clinical trial is to collect human milk samples from 0 to 4 months
      after delivery in order to characterize human milk components. The secondary objectives of
      this study are:

        1. To assess whether there is a correlation between human milk composition and mothers'
           diet

        2. To assess whether there is a correlation between human milk composition and maternal
           clinical parameters

        3. To assess whether there is a correlation between human milk composition and mother and
           infant clinical parameters

    <description>Nutrients in human breast milk samples will be characterized and quantified by analysing with modern analytical techniques (NMR, HPLC-MS and GC-MS) the human milk samples collected at each study visits (3d, 14 days, 1m, 2m, 3m and 4 months after delivery, 1 week after delivery, ). The parameters which will be assessed in human milk samples are : Total Energy Value, Total Macronutrients (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, solids), Lipids' characterization, Peptide profiling, Oligosaccharides profiling, and Micro-RNA profiling. It will be done in 240 completed mothers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Human milk composition versus mothers' diet data</measure>
    <time_frame>between 3 months before delivery and 4 months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The human milk composition profiles (primary outcome) will be correlated in a longitudinal manner to mothers' diet. Information on mother's diet will be collected using a 3-days diary and entering the data in Nutrilog (total intake of the mothers). This will be done before each study visit in 240 completed mothers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Human milk composition versus maternal clinical parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 0 and 4 months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The human milk composition profiles will be correlated in a longitudinal manner to the stage of lactation, the gestation's age, the type of delivery, the sex of the baby, the number of babies the mother already had (gravidity and parity), single/multiple birth. It will be done in 240 completed mothers.</description>

    <time_frame>Between 0 and 4 months after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The human milk composition profiles will be correlated in a longitudinal manner to infant anthropometric measurements (weight, height and head circumference). It will be done in 240 completed mothers.</description>
