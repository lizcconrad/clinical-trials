  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting
      approximately 6-10% of women of reproductive age. Anovulation, infertility and
      hyperandrogenism often co-exist with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance .

      Clomiphene citrate remains the standard drug for induction or augmentation of ovulation.
      However, it is not equally effective in all situations, and therefore it may require
      additional expensive drugs such as N-acetyl cysteine, as an antioxidant, has been suggested
      as an adjuvant in clomiphene-resistant cases .NAC may also improve the circulating level of
      insulin and insulin sensitivity in hyperinsulinaemic women with PCOS, and may be useful for
      the treatment of insulin resistance by ameliorating the homocysteine and lipid profile in
      PCOS .

      NAC has been used effectively as an adjuvant to clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation
      induction in CC-resistant women with PCOS .

      Because it is an insulin sensitizer, NAC was proposed as an adjuvant to clomiphene citrate
      for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are resistant to
      clomiphene citrate. Encouraging results in those patients stimulated us to investigate
      whether adding NAC to the standard treatment with CC results in a higher ovulation rate,
      higher pregnancy rate, and less CC resistance in women with newly diagnosed polycystic ovary
      syndrome using a randomized, double-blind, controlled study.

    <description>Clomiphene citrate, 100 mg, was given from day 3 until day 7. In addition to the CC, each patient was selected randomly to receive either NAC (Sedico, Cairo, ARE), in a dose of 1.2 g/d orally, or a placebo (sugar) of the same volume twice daily from day 3 until day 7. Monitoring of the cycle will involve transvaginal determination of the mean follicular diameter and measurement of serum E2 levels. Monitoring intervals will be determined by patient response.</description>

    <description>Clomiphene citrate, 100 mg, was given from day 3 until day 7. In addition to the CC, each patient was selected randomly to receive either NAC (Sedico, Cairo, ARE), in a dose of 1.2 g/d orally, or a placebo (sugar) of the same volume twice daily from day 3 until day 7. Monitoring of the cycle will involve transvaginal determination of the mean follicular diameter and measurement of serum E2 levels. Monitoring intervals will be determined by patient response. Human chorionic gonadotropin will be given when at least one follicle measured 18 mm and the E2 level had increased. Timed intercourse will be advised 24-36 hours after hCG injection. A serum P level will be checked on cycle days 21-22.
A serum hCG level will be determined 14 days after hCG injection if menses had not yet occurred. Pregnancy will be defined as an increase in the serum hCG level on serial determinations at least 2 days apart.</description>
