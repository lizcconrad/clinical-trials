      Purpose Our study involves two hypotheses. One is that genital infection with HPV is
      associated with increased risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. The second hypothesis is
      that human papillomavirus can ascend from the vagina to the uterus through the cervix and
      cross the placental barrier. We wish to verify these hypotheses in our studies.

      This study will determine the prevalence of HPV in Danish pregnant women and examine HPV's
      role in the aetiology of spontaneous abortion and preterm birth.

      Background Studies have shown significantly higher prevalence of HPV in tissue from
      miscarriages (60%) than from induced abortions (20%). HPV-infection in the extravillous
      trophoblasts in the placenta has furthermore been shown to induce cell death and cause
      dysfunction of the placenta, which can lead to adverse outcome of the pregnancy, e.g. preterm
      birth and hereby related neonatal mortality and morbidity. Spontaneous abortion and preterm
      birth are adverse events of the pregnancy, with for the biggest part unknown aetilogy, an
      area worth trying to elucidate by means of research.

      Method 6 groups of each 91 women will be included:

        -  A group of early pregnant women at the nuchal translucency scan around gestational week
           12 and a similar group undergoing chorion villous sampling in relation to prenatal
           diagnostics of the fetus

        -  A group of women with spontaneous abortion before gestational week 22 and a group with
           preterm birth gestational week 22-32

        -  A group delivering spontaneously at term and a group undergoing elective cesarean at
           term

      The women will be examined by cervical swab to analyze for and do a genotyping of HPV if
      present. A vaginal swab will be done for the purpose of vaginal microbiome examination later.
      Furthermore analysis for HPV in placental tissue from chorion villous sampling or evacuation
      of the uterus after miscarriage. Cervical swabs and placental tissue will be analyzed by
      means of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for the 35 types of HPV most frequently found in the
      anogenital area. Blood samples will be collected from all the patients and analyzed for
      HPV-antibodies.

      Biospecimen will be kept in a biobank for a period of 10 years after the end of this project.
      The biospecimens will be blood samples, cells collected from the ectocervix, vaginal
      microbioma, placental biopsies from prenatal diagnostics or miscarriages.
