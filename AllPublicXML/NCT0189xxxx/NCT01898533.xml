  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators intend to measure changes in BOLD contrast in the breast induced
      by breath-holding for subjects receiving radiation therapy to the breast. This study will
      provide the preliminary data and experience needed to successfully apply BOLD to quantify
      changes in oxygenation and blood flow of breast and tumor for a larger cohort of breast
      radiotherapy patients. The current study has the following objectives:

        1. To determine the feasibility of BOLD contrast MRI of the breast, induced by breath-hold.

        2. To measure the change in BOLD contrast of the breast and / or chest wall tissue for
           females undergoing radiotherapy

    <description>The imaging technique will be considered feasible if for any of the proposed imaging sequences, breath-holding induces a measurable (≥3× standard deviation of background) BOLD contrast signal in at least 30% of the subjects. Contrast will be measured by comparing breath hold sequences to normal breathing.</description>
