  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot and feasibility test an innovative cognitive behavioral
      intervention to improve heart failure self-care among community dwelling older adults.The
      primary aim of this study is to test the effect of the intervention on improving heart
      failure self-care, knowledge and Health related quality of life at 1 month and 3 months. We
      will test three hypotheses comparing 60 older adults with heart failure randomly assigned to
      either the intervention or a control group:

      Hypothesis 1. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly improved heart
      failure self-care than control participants.

      Hypothesis 2. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly improved
      knowledge about heart failure and heart failure self-care than control participants.

      Hypothesis 3. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly better Health
      Related Quality of Life than control participants.

      A secondary exploratory aim is to assess and describe implementation feasibility of providing
      a heart failure self-care intervention in a community group setting.
