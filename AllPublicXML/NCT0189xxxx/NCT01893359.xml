      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy, with regards to
      regression of refractive outcome, as measured by manifest refraction spherical equivalent
      (MRSE), of two treatment regimens for hyperopic and hyperopic astigmatic subjects: LASIK
      followed by cross-linking performed with the KXL System and Photrexa ZD™ (Riboflavin
      Ophthalmic Solution), as compared to LASIK alone.

             a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least one week prior to the visit
             2 and continue to use the method for one month following the treatment. Acceptable
             forms for birth control are spermicide with barrier, oral contraceptive, injectable or

             becoming pregnant include all females who have experienced menarche and have not
             experienced menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for greater than 12 consecutive

             of changes determined by the investigator to be due to unmasking latent hyperopia;

          -  4. Eyes which are pseudophakic and do not have a UV blocking lens implanted;

          -  5. Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase the operative risk or
             confound the outcomes of the study (e.g., dry eyes, immuno- compromised, connective

          -  10. Subjects with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze
             during treatment or other diagnostic tests;

        <description>The co-primary efficacy endpoints are a comparison of MRSE regression in the refractive outcome between the LASIK only eyes and the LASIK with cross-linking eyes within each treatment type and duration (2 minutes continuous UVA or 3 minutes pulsed UVA cross-linking) expressed as the change between one week and six months, and one week and twelve months.</description>

        <population>This trial had extremely low enrollment due to difficulties recruiting patients therefore no analysis was conducted. Data for MSRE were collected for the two treated patients the primary endpoint is a comparison between the treatment groups. The two patients were in the same treatment group so a comparison between groups is not possible.</population>
