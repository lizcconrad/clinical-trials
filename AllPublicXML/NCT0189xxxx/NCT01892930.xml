    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients
      with metastatic kidney cancer undergoing surgery. Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able
      to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the impact of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on the immune system in
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess changes in immune parameters prior to radiation, post radiation and post
      nephrectomy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess surgical parameters for partial or radical nephrectomy post SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT on day 1 and undergo partial or radical nephrectomy on day 29.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have metastatic RCC with primary tumor in place

          -  Must be surgical candidates as deemed fit by surgeon

          -  Have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1
             criteria present

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods
             (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Radiation to primary tumor prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Pregnant or nursing female patients

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the patient an unsuitable
             candidate to receive treatment

          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment
