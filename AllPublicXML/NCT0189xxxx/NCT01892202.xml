      This multicenter observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mircera
      (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) in patients with chronic kidney disease not on
      dialysis in routine clinical practice. Eligible patients treated with Mircera for chronic
      renal anemia according to the standard of care and in line with the current local label will
      be followed for 6 months.
