      The HistoSonics' Histotripsy BPH Device, the Vortx Rx, is a portable ultrasound therapy
      device. The purpose of this study is to assess and monitor the performance of the Vortx Rx
      for initial safety and efficacy for the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

    <description>The Vortx Rx is a portable ultrasound therapy device system that is intended for the treatment of BPH by using very intense, low duty-cycle ultrasound pulses to debulk prostatic tissue.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Vortx Rx - Histotripsy BPH Device</intervention_name>
    <description>Non-invasive histotripsy treatment/therapy to be delivered by the surgeon using very low duty cycle ultrasound pulses from outside the patient's body. These pulses form a bubble cloud at the end of the focal area within the prostate which mechanically breaks up the cellular structure of the soft tissue. During treatment, a surgeon is able to direct the bubble cloud throughout the targeted volume using controls located on the device console and using the real-time ultrasound for visualization feedback and control of the bubble cloud location.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of BPH and eligible for endoscopic BPH surgery including TURP, PVP,
             electrovaporization.

          2. Prostate volumes 30 - 80 gm based on transrectal ultrasound

          3. Men ≥ 50 years of age

          4. IPSS symptom score ≥ 13 and IPSS bother score &gt; 2 (see Appendix B for IPSS
             questionnaire)

          5. Baseline peak flow rate Qmax ≤ 15 cc/s with voided volume at least 125 cc

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of prostate or bladder cancer, pelvic radiation, untreated bladder stones,
             urethral strictures/bladder neck contracture (BNC), renal insufficiency (i.e.
             creatinine &gt; 1.4)

          2. Neurogenic bladder, Parkinson's disease

          3. Prior treatment for urinary incontinence

          4. Micturition frequency AND urgency. Micturition frequency defined as &gt; 8 micturitions
             per 24 hours as assessed by a thorough subject history including the question: &quot;On
             average, how many times do you void during a 24 hour period? // &lt; 4, 5-7, 8 or more.&quot;
             Urgency defined as an uncontrollable urge to void that occurs &gt; 3 per 24 hours as
             assessed through the subject history/question: &quot;On average, how many times a day do
             you have an uncontrollable urgency to void? // 0, 1-2, 3 or more?&quot;

          5. Intravesical prostate lobe protrusion &gt; 1 cm on TRUS. Note: this is distinct from
             lateral lobes protruding up to the bladder such as an intravesical protrusion without
             median lobe

          6. Active UTI (i.e. must have a screening urinalysis without signs of infection or a
             negative urine culture)

          7. PVR &gt; 250 at time of enrollment or catheter dependent bladder drainage

          8. History of chronic prostatitis within the last 5 years

          9. Not able to temporarily discontinue aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix and any other
             anticoagulant at least seven days prior to the time of treatment

         10. History of known bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease [VWD]) and subjects
             determined to have a bleeding disorder by prothrombin time (PT) and partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) tests.

         11. Prior BPH prostate procedures (e.g. TUMT, TUNA, water induced thermotherapy [WIT],
             TURP, PVP)

         12. Men with confirmed or suspected malignancy of the prostate based on a digital rectal
             exam (DRE), prostate biopsy or PSA &gt; 10 ng/mL. Men with free PSA &lt; 25% and PSA between
             2.5 and 10 ng/mL may only be enrolled after a negative biopsy. If a prior prostate
             biopsy was performed within one year of enrollment and was negative for cancer, repeat
             biopsy is not required if in the investigator's judgment there is no clinical evidence
             to support biopsy reassessment. If a biopsy is required, the subject shall have a
             six-week waiting period between the biopsy and histotripsy treatment, if he is
             otherwise deemed eligible to participate in the study.

         13. Men interested in future fertility

         14. Declines or unable to provide informed consent

         15. Non-English-speaker

         16. Life expectancy estimated to be less than one year

         17. Unable or unwilling to complete all required questionnaires and follow-up assessments

         18. In the opinion of the investigator, it is not in the subject's best interest to
             participate in the study.
