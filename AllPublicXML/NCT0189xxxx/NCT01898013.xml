  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, two-arm trial of pregnenolone and placebo to
      determine the possible analgesic effects in OEF/OIF Veterans with chronic low back pain. The
      total study duration is 6 weeks (followed by two-follow up phone calls). All patients will
      monitor pain symptoms for one week with pain diaries, followed by a 1-week placebo-only
      lead-in period, 90 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Of these
      subjects, 45 subjects will receive pregnenolone, and 45 subjects will receive placebo for 4
      weeks. Patient interview assessments and laboratory studies will be performed at each
      interview time point. Pregnenolone, allopregnanolone and other neurosteroid metabolites will
      be determined by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), proceeded by high
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain rating</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary efficacy outcome measure will be the weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain severity scores recorded daily on an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression (Beck, et al., 1961). Scores range from 0 (no depression) to 63 (severe depression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Davidson Trauma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on 5-point frequency (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;every day&quot;) and severity scales (0 = &quot;not at all distressing&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely distressing&quot;). Respondents are asked to identify the trauma that is most disturbing to them and to rate, in the past week, how much trouble they have had with each symptom. The DTS yields a frequency score (ranging from 0 to 68), severity score (ranging from 0 to 68), and total score (ranging from 0 to 136).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Athens Insomnia Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale assesses the severity of insomnia using diagnostic criteria set forth by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The eight-item questionnaire evaluates sleep onset, night and early-morning waking, sleep time, sleep quality, frequency and duration of complaints, distress caused by the experience of insomnia, and interference with daily functioning. Scores range from 0 (no sleep disturbance) to 24 (significant sleep disturbance).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey laps eight concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favourable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) has been developed and tested as (i) a measure of degree of resilience, (ii) as a predictor of outcome to treatment with medication or psychotherapy, stress management and resilience-building; (iii) as a marker of progress during treatment; (iv) as a marker of biological (i.e. physical) changes in the brain. The scale also has promise as a method to screen people for high, intermediate or low resilience. The CD-RISC comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0-4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure designed is to assess self-rated physical disability caused by low back pain. This is a 24-item questionnaire. The patient is asked to tick a statement when it applies to him that specific day, this makes it possible to follow changes in time. The end score is the sum of the ticked boxes. The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 24 (max. disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Impression of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure that reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment. There is a 10-point scale depicting patients rating of overall improvement and a 7-point scale to assess change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions and overall quality of life. Higher scores are indicative of greater improvement for both scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Sequencing Task</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be presented auditorily with clusters of numbers (e.g., 936) of increasing length. They are asked to tell the experimenter the numbers in order, from lowest to highest.
Measures: number of correct responses</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tower of London</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will look at two pictures simultaneously. Each picture will show three different colored balls arranged on three pegs, but the balls will be in a unique arrangement in each picture. The patient will give the minimum number of times the balls in one picture would have to be moved in order to make the arrangement of balls identical to that of the other, opposing picture.
Measures: number of correct responses. 20 items administered. 22 items administered if items 1-2 are answered correctly. Scoring is 0-22 (0 being lowest score-greater impairment, 22 being highest score, no impairment).</description>
