    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the potential of
      aleglitazar to reduce the risk of end stage renal disease and cardiovascular mortality in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Patients will be
      randomized to receive oral daily doses of aleglitazar or matching placebo. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is approximately 3 years.
