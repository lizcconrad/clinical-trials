      UMRS 938 Paris, UPMC, Institut hospitalo-Universitaire- Institute of Cardiometabolism and

      Objectives Principal objective To compare the inflammatory profile of the epicardial adipose
      tissue (EAT) between people living with and without HIVwho present with coronary heart
      disease and will undergo a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

      Secondary objectives

        -  To compare the volume of EAT between people living with and without HIV who present with
           coronary heart disease

        -  To evaluate the relationship between the abnormalities of the expression profiles of the
           adipocytokines and cytokines with the atherosclerotic lesions.

        -  To evaluate the relationship between the abnormalities of the expression profiles of the
           adipocytokines and cytokines of the EAT with the circulating levels and metabolic
           parameters.

        -  To compare the histological and inflammatory profiles of the EAT with the subcutaneous
           adipose tissue for each patient individually.

      Methodology multicentric, comparative study

      Estimated enrollment 31 participants in total

        1. st group of- 15 people living with HIV undergoing CABG (coronary heart disease HIV+
           group)

        2. nd group of- 16 people without HIV- undergoing CABG (coronary heart disease HIV- group)
           People without HIV-will be matched to people living with HIV+ by : age (± 5 years) and
           sex Outcomes

      Primary outcome:

      Comparative analysis of the inflammatory profile of the EAT : expression profile of the pro
      and anti inflammatory cytokines and adipokines within the EAT in both groups of participants
      : coronary heart disease HIV+ and HIV- groups

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  Determination of the EAT volume by echocardiography and cardiac scanner for both groups

        -  Macroscopic profile of the EAT : adipocytes, fibrosis, endothelial cell density)

        -  RT-PCR analyses : renin, adiponectine, PPARɣ

        -  Comparatison of the inflammatory and macroscopic profiles between the EAT and the
           subcutaneous adipose tissue in the two groups by ARN messagers analysis.

      Eligibility Inclusion criteria HIV+ group

        -  Men or women above the age of 18 years old, HIV1 seropositive for more than 6 months

        -  Individual undergoing, for the first time, cardiac surgery for CABG

        -  Affiliated with a social security regimen (the AME is not a social security regimen)

        -  Signed the consent form

      HIV- group

        -  Men or women above the age of 18 years old, HIV seronegative

        -  Individuals undergoing, for the first time, cardiac surgery for CABG

        -  Affiliated with a social security regimen (the AME is not a social security regimen)

        -  Signed the consent form

      Non-inclusion criteria History of surgery for CBAG and/or congenital heart defect- being
      under the tutorship or guardianship of the state or in custody of the justice system.

      Statistical methods Categorical variables will be compared using Fisher's exact test.
      Continuous variables will be compared using the Student's t-test (parametric) and the
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric) as appropriate considering the data distribution.
