  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recruitment strategy in Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients mechanically
      ventilated combines recruitment maneuvers and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).
      Recruitment maneuvers promote alveolar recruitment leading to increased end-expiratory lung
      volume in order to prevent repetitive opening and closing of unstable lung units and reduce
      the strain induced by ventilation. In addition, recruitment is effective in improving
      oxygenation. Variety of recruitment maneuver have been described, the most commonly used is
      the application of sustained continuous positive airway pressure at 40 cmH2O for 40 seconds.
      Staircase recruitment maneuver (SRM) is an alternative with good hemodynamic tolerance.
      Staircase recruitment maneuver (SRM) involves a progressive increase in positive end
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) (up to 40 cmH2O), in pressure control ventilation, in order to
      increase end-expiratory lung volume (EELV); then a decreasing PEEP trial is performed. The
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent alveolar collapse depends on ratio between
      lung elastance and chest wall elastance. If chest wall elastance is high, the PEEP to obtain
      a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure is high. The only way for the time being to
      know the transpulmonary pressure and the ratio between lung and chest wall elastance is the
      use of esophageal catheter. A non-invasive method for measuring the lung elastance by
      measuring volume recruited during a change of pressure (∆PEEP/∆EELV) could be used to avoid
      the use of esophageal catheter.

    <description>Patients will be in supine position with 30-45° head of bed elevation. The cuff of the endotracheal tube will be transiently overinflated to 60 cmH2O to ensure there will be no air leaks. NMBA (cisatracurium) will be administrated [9]. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be adjusted for continuously monitored oxygen saturation (SpO2) between 90 to 94%. Patients will be ventilated in pressure control with 15 cmH2O of driving pressure.
A low flow pressure/volume curve from 0 to 40 cmH2O will be performed.</description>
