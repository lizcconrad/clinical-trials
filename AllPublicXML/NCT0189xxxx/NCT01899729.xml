  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMO 8400 is a second-generation oligonucleotide antagonist of endosomal Toll-like receptors
      (TLR) 7, TLR8 and TLR9. These TLR react to complexes of exogenous nucleic acids (as might be
      encountered during infection) and endogenous nucleic acids (as might be released during
      tissue damage during autoimmune disease). In vitro and in multiple animal models of
      autoimmune disease, IMO-8400 blocks immune activation mediated through TLR7, 8 and 9. In
      Phase 1 studies (Protocol 8400-001) IMO 8400 has been administered to healthy adults by SC
      injection at single-doses and multiple-doses (4 weeks) up to 0.6 mg/kg. All treatments were
      well-tolerated, with mild injection site reactions and no pattern of systemic reactions or
      laboratory changes.

      The current study represents the first clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with active
      autoimmune disease. Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was chosen for this 12-week proof of
      activity trial based on a prior 4-week study using a first generation TLR7 and 9 antagonist
      which demonstrated clinical improvement in this patient population.

      Eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive one of the four treatments
      (three dose levels of IMO-8400 or Saline Placebo). Treatments will be administered once
      weekly by subcutaneous injections. Subjects will received treatment for 12 weeks and then be
      followed for an additional 6 weeks to assess the durability of the response.
