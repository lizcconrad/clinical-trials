  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of abscesses traditionally involves incision and drainage (I&amp;D). Abscesses are
      frequently are &quot;packed&quot; or stented open with the presence of a wick, and traditional care
      requires re-visits every 2-3 days to have the packing removed and replaced, until finally the
      abscess cavity has closed, usually 1-2 weeks after initial presentation.

      Recently there have been attempts to employ less invasive techniques for abscess management.
      One novel technique, &quot;loop drainage&quot;, has been reported in case reports/case series for
      management of a variety of types of abscesses in the surgical subspecialty literature.

      We propose to conduct a randomized prospective study comparing the efficacy of the loop
      drainage technique with the traditional incision and drainage technique of abscess
      management.

      Patients presenting to the main or urgent care areas of the Emergency Department at Boston
      Medical Center for treatment of an abscess will be considered for enrollment as potential
      subjects. After the treating clinician identifies the patient as an appropriate subject, a
      Research Associate (RA) will approach the patient and obtain written informed consent to
      enroll in the study. The subject will then be randomized to the management arm of either loop
      drainage or traditional I&amp;D. The clinician will fill out a data sheet describing the abscess
      characteristics, and then perform either loop drainage or incision and drainage, depending on
      randomization and the subject will fill out a satisfaction survey. Fourteen days after
      initial visit, subjects will return for follow-up. The subject will fill out a satisfaction
      survey, and a study investigator blinded to the treatment group will assess the subject for
      abscess resolution, cosmetic outcome, number of follow-up visits, and complications.

      The study investigators will then compare outcomes between the two study groups.

Two (or more) stab incisions are made in the abscess, the cavity is probed and pus is drained, and a vessel loop is inserted and tied off. The patient manipulates the loop 3 times per day, and removes the loop when all redness is gone and no more pus is present</description>
