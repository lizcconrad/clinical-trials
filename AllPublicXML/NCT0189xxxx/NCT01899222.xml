        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  The ability to give informed consent and be willing to spend up to two hours in the
             eye clinic during the duration of the study.

          -  The subjects may have a normal retina and optic nerve, or subjects may have
             abnormalities of the posterior pole of the retina or the optic nerve.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Medical or ophthalmic instability that would create a contraindication for minimally
             invasive ophthalmic diagnostic testing will exclude participation as a subject.

          -  Ophthalmic pathology felt by the principal investigator that would make retinal
             imaging with standard photographs difficult or not possible.
