    <textblock>
      The study will explore escalating doses of melflufen in combination with dexamethasone in
      small groups of patients to find the maximum tolerated dose of melflufen. That dose will then
      be used to determine the efficacy and safety profile of melflufen in combination with
      dexamethasone in a larger group of patients.

               3. Serum immunoglobulin free light chain ≥10 mg/dL AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin
                  kappa to lambda free light chain ratio

               4. If no monoclonal protein is detected, then ≥ 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma
                  cells

          4. Patient has had at least 2 or more prior lines of therapy including lenalidomide and

             of the last therapy

          5. Life expectancy of ≥6 months

          6. Patient has an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Patients with lower performance status
             based solely on bone pain secondary to multiple myeloma will be eligible)

          7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             prior to patient registration

          8. Female patients of child bearing potential and non-vasectomized male patients agree to
             practice appropriate methods of birth control

          9. Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information

         10. The patient has, or accepts to have, an acceptable infusion device for infusion of
             melflufen

         11. 12 lead ECG with QtcF interval ≤ 470 msec

         12. The following laboratory results must be met within 21 days of patient registration:

          5. Other ongoing anti-myeloma therapy. Patients may be receiving concomitant therapy with
             bisphosphonates and low dose corticosteroids for symptom management and comorbid
             conditions. Doses of corticosteroid should be stable for at least 7 days prior to
             patient registration.

          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding females

          7. Serious psychiatric illness, active alcoholism, or drug addiction that may hinder or
             confuse follow-up evaluation

          8. Known HIV or hepatitis B or C viral infection

          9. Patient has concurrent symptomatic amyloidosis or plasma cell leukemia

         10. POEMS syndrome

         11. Previous cytotoxic therapies, including cytotoxic investigational agents, for multiple
             myeloma within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) prior to start of study treatment.

             corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to patient registration. Patient has side effects
             of the previous therapy &gt; grade 1 or previous baseline.

         13. Radiotherapy within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. However, if the radiation portal
             covered ≤ 5% of the bone marrow reserve, the patient may be enrolled irrespective of
             the end date of radiotherapy
