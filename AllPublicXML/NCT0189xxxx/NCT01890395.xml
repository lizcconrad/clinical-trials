      To identify patients who may be predisposed for developing MOF (multiple organ failure)by the
      sampling of blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for doing this study is the recognition that mitochondrial DNA Damage
      Associated Molecular Patterns (mtDAMPs) accumulate in the circulation after severe injury.
      Furthermore our own studies in severely injured patients identify that the mtDAMPS are
      increased 3-28 fold in those patients who eventually develop multiple organ dysfunction
      syndrome (MODS) compared to those severely traumatized patients who did not develop MODS. The
      relative risk of death from MODS after severe trauma was increased 8-20 times in those
      patients with elevated mt DAMP levels.

      This study is then being done to correlate mitochondrial damp levels in surgical trauma to
      assess the time course and the levels of mtDAMPs with the type of surgical procedure. We
      believe that this information will help us to determine the time course of events and the
      triggers for development of multiple organ dysfunction seen after surgery.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary studies (at University of South Alabama)in the trauma and burn patients indicate that the level of mitochondrial damps are highly correlated with non-survival; that is, they reflect a massive trauma. They also reflect patients that have a propensity to go into multiple system organ failure. We believe that these measurements in our surgical patients will also reveal many of the same correlations with the correlation between microvascular circulation and the mitochondrial damps.</description>
