  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill children have abnormal utilization of nutrients such as glucose, lipids and
      protein. Often sick children have increased glucose concentrations in blood. However, the
      origin of the high glucose has not been determined in these populations. There is a close
      interrelationship between protein and energy metabolism. An increase in the energy supply
      will not promote nitrogen retention unless the amino acid supply is adequate, and conversely,
      an increased amino acid supply will be useless if energy is limiting, hence the importance of
      adequate protein and energy intake. Our study aims to investigate the protein-energy
      interactions in critically ill septic children and adolescents with the objective to
      eventually provide the best nutritional support for these patients.

      This is an observational study, aimed at exploring:

      i) gluconeogenesis rates ii) sources of gluconeogenesis and pyruvate cycling, and iii)
      protein kinetics in critically ill children and adolescents, and its differences by age
      group, as well as in comparison to healthy adolescents. The study size will include 45
      critically ill septic, pediatric patients (22 children at 5-12 years of age and 23
      adolescents' at 13-19 years of age), male and females admitted to the pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) at Children's Medical Center, Dallas. The minimal subject's weight will be
      17kg. Additionally, 30 healthy adolescents matched by age, gender, BMI and Tanner stage will
      be studied at the Clinical Translational Research Center at Zale Lipshy Hospital, to serve as
      healthy adolescent controls. The number of subjects includes an expected drop out rate of
      about 20%, in order to obtain 18 patients with complete data in each group. Patients will
      receive nutritional support as per standard care. This study will yield important knowledge
      and may lead in the future to changes in the current practice on the management of critically
      ill pediatric patients in the PICU.

        Septic pediatric subjects: A total of 45 critically ill children age 5-19 years with
        diagnosis of sepsis, as defined by the International Sepsis Consensus Conference.

        Healthy subjects: A total of 30 healthy adolescents 13-19 years matched for age, gender,
        Tanner and BMI to serve as controls. A Dexa scan will be obtained to determine lean body
        mass.
