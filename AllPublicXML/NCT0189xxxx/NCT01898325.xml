  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigated cohort will examine liver and spleen fibrosis in patients with Gaucher
      disease divided into two groups, naive GD patients and GD patients treated with ERT. As liver
      biopsy in these patients not recommended because the risk of bleeding using Fibroscan is a
      safe with diagnostic accuracy regarding the liver (&amp; Spleen) fibrosis. Estimating spleen
      fibrosis is an innovative approach in liver disease and Gaucher.

      The evaluation of fibrosis with this new and safe method could avoid complications
      antiinvasive procedure in GD patients. The addition of fibrosis biomarkers will help for
      patients score evaluation. The finding of liver and spleen stiffness will be evaluated in
      native and ERT treated Gaucher patients in order to assess ERT effect on fibrosis.

      The Aims are: 1) To assess liver and spleen stiffness measurement using fibroscan and
      evaluate liver and spleen fibrosis in patients with GD.

      2) To compare the elastography in two cohorts of GD patients: ERT treated and naïve GD
      patients and two control groups of patients: healthy and Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
      patients.

      3) To correlate the elastography findings with clinical and laboratory data in the four
      patient groups focusing on Gaucher disease manifestations and GD severity. To compare the
      elastography in GD naïve and ERT treated patients.

      The investigated cohort will include 4 groups of patients 20 probands in each group
      including: 1) Naïve GD patients 2) GD treated with ERT 3) Healthy control 4) Patients with
      NonAlcoholic Steatohepatitis( NASH) which are followed at hepatology unit of the Ziv Hospital
      and healthy controls.

      Serum fibrosis markers will be tested including: Bilirubin ,GGT, Haptoglobin,AST,ALT .The
      findings of spleen and liver fibrosis will be correlated with disease severity usingZimran's
      Severity Score Index (SSI) liver function tests , serology for viral hepatitis, GDbiomarkers,
      hemoglobin, platelet levels, and a GD severity score.

      Protein C will be measured in all groups of patients Protein C activity as it may be used as
      a sensitive marker of hepatocellular damage even in those patients with mild liver affection
      .Also Patients with cirrhosis possess an imbalance in pro-coagulant versus
      anticoagulantactivity due to increased factor VIII and decreased protein C.

    <description>Fibrosis will be estimated by the degree of elastography measured by the liver and spleen stifness in kilopascals (kPa).
Transient elastography will be performed using a Fibro Scan device (EchoSens, Paris, France). A median value [expressed in kilopascals (kPa)] of 10 successful acquisitions will be s considered the representative measurement of liver stiffness. We consider 10 acquisitions with a success rate of at least 60% and an interquartile range (IQR) lower than 20% as representative measurements.
The FibroScan® and its dedicated probes make up an active, non-implantable medical device using ultrasound. Designed to rapidly measure liver stiffness in a painless and totally non-invasive manner.
The FibroScan® is based on the one-dimensional pulse elastography technique.</description>
