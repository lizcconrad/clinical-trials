      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the costs and benefits of the ConforMIS iTotal®
      total knee replacement system versus standard total knee arthroplasty.

      This study is designed to illustrate the difference in cost between standard total knee
      replacements and the ConforMIS iTotal at a single institution.

      STUDY DESIGN The study is a two-arm single-center, consecutively enrolled retrospective
      study. Patients enrolled will have previously received either an iTotal CR knee replacement
      or a standard total knee replacement. The study site will be located in the United States. A
      minimum of 100 with a maximum of 120 patients will be enrolled in each study arm for a
      maximum of 200 - 240 patients.

      STUDY DURATION This study involves retrospective data collection of operative and
      peri-operative information to determine the cost impact of several surgical variables. The
      study will be complete when the retrospective data has been collected on up to 120 patients
      per arm.
