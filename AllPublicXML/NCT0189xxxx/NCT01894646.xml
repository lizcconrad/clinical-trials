  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, only three radiotracers, (2-[18F]FA, 6-[18F]FA and [18F]AZAN), are available for
      studying α4β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α4β2-nAChR) in human brain using PET
      imaging. A crucial problem for 2-[18F] FA, 6-[18F] FA and ([18F] AZAN is low binding
      potential (BP) in extrathalamic (ET) regions, including hippocampus, cortex and caudate which
      have lower receptor densities than the thalamus. The importance of imaging ET-α4β2-nAChRs
      (ET-nAChR) has emerged from the post-mortem demonstration of altered densities of ET-nAChRs
      (but not thalamic nAChR) in neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia. PET imaging of
      ET-nAChR may prove to be useful in both detecting early changes and following functional
      deterioration in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, PET
      imaging of ET-nAChR may allow investigation and development of new therapies acting on the
      acetylcholine system.

      The imaging drawbacks of the presently available nAChR radioligands have initiated the
      development of radioligands with greater binding potential by several research groups. The
      available pre-clinical data on the investigators' new radioligand [18F](-)-JHU86428
      ([18F]XTRA) suggest that this radioligand is superior to 2-[18F]FA for quantitative PET
      imaging of α4β2-nAChR (Gao, J. Med. Chem, 2008). In baboon PET studies [18F]XTRA exhibits
      200% greater brain uptake, 300% higher BPs and reaches steady-state in approximately 1.5 h in
      cortical regions post-bolus administration versus 6-8 h for 2-[18F]FA. In vitro binding
      assays shows greater binding affinity of XTRA and similar nAChR-subtype selectivity in
      comparison with 2-FA. Both ligands bind selectively with the β2-subtypes that are predominant
      nAChR subtypes in the mammal brain and display little binding affinity at ganglionic
      α3β4-nAChR.

      The current planned human protocol will be conducted to (1) determine brain distribution
      (brain uptake) and test the reproducibility (in test-retest design) of [18F]XTRA brain PET
      scans for validation of the radioligand; (2) generate estimates of the whole body and
      internal organ radiation absorbed doses from exposure to single iv administrations of
      [18F]XTRA in healthy human subjects; and (3) determine brain distribution of [18F]XTRA in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The population consists of healthy adults 18-85 years of age. There is no race or sex bias
        in our recruitment.
