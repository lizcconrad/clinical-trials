    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or
      PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring tumors in patients undergoing clinical
      imaging or with newly diagnosed breast cancer. New diagnostic procedures, such as PET/CT or
      PET/MRI, may be more effective than MRI alone in measuring tumors in patients undergoing
      clinical imaging or with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve visualization of tumors by developing better image reconstruction and
      correction methods.

      II. To revise the positioning devices and, if necessary, scanner table to fit a wider size
      range of women.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo clinical fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-PET/CT followed by prone breast PET/CT
      and/or prone breast PET/MRI with or without gadopentetate dimeglumine (DTPA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  [Cohorts 1 and 2] Female patients who are referred by their physician to have a
             clinical PET/CT

          -  [Cohort 3] Patients referred for clinical breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI
             for recently diagnosed breast cancer

          -  Normal kidney function for subjects that will receive magnetic resonance (MR) contrast
             agent as part of their clinical imaging

          -  For subjects for whom MR contrast agent is to be administered, University Hospitals
             (UH) policy 8.17.26 will be applied

               -  The following guidelines will be followed when a patient or patient
                  representative responds &quot;yes&quot; to questions on the MRI history sheet 'Are you on
                  dialysis, history of kidney failure, end stage renal disease, chronic liver
                  disease, or are you a peri-liver transplant patient':

                    -  The patient must have a serum creatinine value available within three (3)
                       weeks prior to the injection of gadolinium

                    -  Calculate an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum
                       creatinine; if the eGFR is less than 30 the attending radiologist must
                       discuss the risks and benefits of administering gadolinium with the
                       referring physician and patient; the collective judgment of the patient,
                       radiologist and referring physician must be in agreement to proceed with the
                       injection of gadolinium

                    -  Calculated eGFR in range of 31-59 requires the judgment of the attending
                       radiologist whether to discuss gadolinium administration with referring
                       physician and patient or whether to directly use or hold the contrast agent

                    -  If an eGFR is greater than 60, gadolinium may be administered without
                       further physician or patient discussion

                    -  Gadolinium administration is limited to single dose at 0.1mmol/kg; Omniscan
                       should not be used

                    -  Technologist will document radiologist decision to administer gadolinium on
                       the MRI history sheet; radiologist will document decision and consultation
                       with the referring physician and patient in the MRI report

                    -  PERITONEAL DIALYSIS PATIENTS:

                         -  No gadolinium will be administered unless the patient has been
                            scheduled for hemodialysis within 24 hours following the injection of
                            gadolinium; technologist will determine eGFR and follow above
                            guidelines; dialysis will be scheduled by the referring physician

                    -  HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS:

                         -  No gadolinium will be administered unless the patient has been
                            scheduled for hemodialysis within 24 hours following the injection of
                            gadolinium; no determination of eGFR is necessary; radiologist will
                            assume eGFR less than 30 and follow above guidelines; dialysis will be
                            scheduled by the referring physician

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who do not meet all of the above inclusion criteria

          -  Subjects unwilling or unable to sign the informed consent form

          -  Subjects who are cognitively impaired and thus unable to give informed consent

          -  Subjects unable to undergo MR scanning due to exclusion via University Hospitals Case
             Medical Center (UHCMC) MR restrictions (e.g. certain implanted metallic or electronic
             devices)

          -  Subjects who are pregnant

          -  Subjects that are too large to fit comfortably into the PET/MR on the breast coil; for
             cohort 1 only we will accept a maximum of 10 subjects that are too large for the
             PET/MRI to acquire a prone PET/CT but without the paired PET/MR
