  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The amount of active therapy provided to patients on an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit
      has been reported as often insufficient. Observational studies have found that in the first
      14 days post stroke, patients receive very little therapy and have very low activity levels.
      More opportunity to practice may, however, improve short-term outcomes such as the level of
      mobility, endurance, use of the affected arm and leg, and length of stay. The Stroke
      Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity (SIRRACT) trial will utilize sensors that
      reveal the type, quantity, and aspects of quality of patient activities outside of the
      confines of research laboratories. SIRRACT will deploy inexpensive Personal Activity Monitors
      (PAMs), comprised of triaxial accelerometers worn on the thighs.

      The objectives of the study are:

      i. To assess the impact of feedback from Personal Activity Monitors (PAM)s on amount of
      active practice, walking speed and distance in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.

      ii. To assess the impact of feedback from PAMs on physical, psycho-emotional, cognitive and
      ecosocial Health-Related Quality of Life of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.

      iii. To assess the acceptability of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patients
      undergoing rehabilitation.

      iv. To assess the reliability and validity of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke
      patients undergoing rehabilitation.

      Hypotheses In moderate to severely disabled subjects who are receiving in-patient
      rehabilitation, daily feedback from PAMs about purposeful activity will increase the amount
      of active practice by &gt;30%, a higher proportion of subjects who reach the level of
      independence for walking, and increase walking speed by 25%, leading to higher mean walking
      speeds and distances at the time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Daily feedback
      from PAMs on increase in walking speed and distances will improve physical, psychological,
      cognitive and ecosocial domains of Health-related quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Admission for acute inpatient neurorehabilitation of a first stroke (or second stroke
             after full recovery from prior Transient Ischemic Attack/Stroke).

          -  Time from onset of stroke to admission for rehabilitation &lt;35 days.

          -  Stroke from any cause (thrombotic infarct, cardioembolism, intracerebral hemorrhage)
             that includes unilateral hemiparesis. Hemiparesis means less than or equal 4/5
             strength by the British Medical Council scale for hip flexion tested supine and for
             knee or ankle flexion and extension (scores less than or equal 22 of 25)

          -  Ability to follow simple instructions, especially to understand verbal reinforcement
             about activity.

          -  Independent in mobility prior to admission.

          -  Able to walk with no more than physical assistance of 2 persons for at least 3 meters.
             Subjects can use any type of assistive device and brace needed.

          -  Able to understand and repeat information related to the Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current medical disease that will limit physical therapy at the time of randomization
             or limited walking prior to the stroke, such as serious infection, Deep Vein
             Thrombosis, orthostatic hypotension, &gt; stage 2 decubitus ulcer of buttocks or legs,
             congestive heart failure, claudication, and pain with weight-bearing or walking.
             Subjects can be entered if a complication resolves within 7 days of admission
             screening.

          -  Aphasia with inability to follow 2-step directions during therapeutic instructions or
             answers Yes/No to questions with greater than or equal 75% accuracy related to
             personal health and symptoms.
