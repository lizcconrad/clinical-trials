  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would study about impact of the administration of probiotics in the
      intestinal mucosa of patients undergoing resection colic, by evaluating cytokine profile by
      quantitative real time PCR. The investigators believe that patients who use probiotic
      preoperative would provide cytokine profile less inflammatory than those of the control
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Samples of colorectal cancer-free mucosa derived from patients who underwent surgical
      resection were investigated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was
      used to determine expression levels of the following genes: IL10, IL1B, IL23A, TNF, IL12B,
      INFG, IL17A.
