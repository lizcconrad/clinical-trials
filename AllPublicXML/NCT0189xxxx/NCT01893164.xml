  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory disturbance were tested with Semmes-Weinstein filaments and sensory deficits were categorized according to the Yale sensory scale. According to standard scoring system that designed, the severity of sensation and function of the ulnar nerve was scored as follows: ---- 0, Abscent sensation; 1, Decrease or abnormal sensation; 2, Intact sensation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength was evaluated with the grading system from the Medical Research Council which is based upon a scale of zero to five: 0, No muscle contraction; 1,Flicker or trace of muscle contraction; 2,Limb or joint movement possible only with gravity eliminated; 3,Limb or joint movement against gravity only; 4,Power decreased but limb or joint movement possible against resistance; 5,Normal power against resistance. Then results were scored as follows: ---- 0,Poor (0-1); 1,Moderate (2-3); 2,Good (4-5)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with scores of zero to ten (0 for no pain and 10 intolerable pain) then scored as follows: ---- 0, Sever (8-10); 1, Slight (4-7); 2, none (0-3)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the result at 6 months post-operatively with the result before operation.To see if there is an improvement in the function of the ulnar nerve.0,no improvement;1,improvement.</description>
