  <brief_title>Comparative Study of BAY86-5300 With a Flexible Extended Regimen for Dysmenorrhea</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Multi-center, Randomized, Open-label, Active-controlled, Parallel-group Comparative Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of a Flexible Extended Regimen of BAY 86-5300 (0.02 mg Ethinylestradiol [β-CDC] and 3 mg Drospirenone) Compared to the 28-day (24 + 4-day) Regimen of BAY 86-5300 in the Treatment of Dysmenorrhea for 24 Weeks</official_title>

    <textblock>
      The is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group comparative
      study (24-week treatment period).

      The objective of this study is to prove the superiority of BAY 86-5300 with flexible extended
      regimen for treatment of dysmenorrhea to BAY 86-5300 with 28-day cyclic regimen in terms of
      primary efficacy variable, number of days with dysmenorrheic pain over 140 days of evaluation
      period.

      In addition, the long-term safety of the flexible extended regimen of BAY86-5300 in patients
      treated for one year will be investigated.

             Dysmenorrheic pain means any spasmodic pelvic pain or lower abdominal pain with
             possible radiation towards back or thighs recorded in the Patient Diary in
             correspondence with a withdrawal and/or menstrual bleeding episode. Pain could start
             up to 2 days before the onset of the bleeding episode the bleeding and terminates on

          -  Patients for whom YAZ Combination Tablet is contraindicated (according to Japanese
