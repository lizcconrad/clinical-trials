  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare functional status and quality of life of a group of
      patients with chronic venous insufficiency treated with manual lymphatic drainage with a
      group not treated with manual lymphatic drainage.

      Investigators hypothesized that manual lymphatic drainage can improve:

        -  quality of life,

        -  functional status,

        -  calf muscle strength,

        -  ankle range of motion,

        -  edema,

        -  severity of disease,

        -  and symptoms.
