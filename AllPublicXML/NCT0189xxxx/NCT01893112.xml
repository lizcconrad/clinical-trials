  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American women account for 66% of HIV infections in women in the U.S., AIDS is a
      leading cause of death for African American women, and African Americans have the lowest
      medication adherence rates compared to other groups in the U.S. One of the reasons for low
      medication adherence among African Americans is fear of stigma. HIV stigma has been linked to
      depression, psychological distress, poor quality of life, poor medication adherence and
      service utilization contributing to morbidity and mortality. Research has found that stigma
      is a moderator to poor adherence via depressive symptoms.

      The current study is a randomized control trial with a time and attention control group to
      test the effectiveness of a stigma reduction intervention adapted for use with African
      American women. A total of 224 African American women will be recruited to participate in the
      study. Half of the women will be from Chicago, Illinois (112) and the other half will be from
      Birmingham, Alabama (112). A workshop will be held once a study site has recruited 28 women,
      half of the women will be in the intervention group (14) and the other half will be in the
      control group (14). Each study site will have 4 cohorts of 28 women.

      The main aims of the current study are:

        1. to determine the long-term effectiveness of the intervention to reduce stigma for
           African American women living with HIV in Chicago Illinois and Birmingham, Alabama

        2. to examine whether stigma reduction due to the intervention is associated with improved
           physical health biomarkers (CD4+ T cell count, viral load), mediated by reduced
           psychological symptoms (depressive symptoms), improved engagement to care, and improved
           medication adherence

        3. to explore whether stigma reduction due to the intervention is moderated by location
           (Chicago vs. Birmingham), transmission risk factor, time since diagnosis, and perceived
           social support

      We expect that the multimedia workshop intervention will demonstrate effectiveness in
      reducing internalized stigma through an easily-disseminated method, and that it will have a
      positive impact on medication adherence and engagement in care for African American women
      living with HIV.

    <description>The intervention is a workshop facilitated by a peer advocate (an African American woman who is also HIV positive) and a social worker. It has exercises, videos and group discussions intended to equip participants with coping skills to overcome HIV related stigma and the negative outcomes related to stigma. The workshop will last about 8 hours total across 2 two days (4 hours per day). The researcher in the current study has done a lot of work in adapting this intervention for African American women. The workshop has been piloted in Seattle and had promising results. Based on results in the pilot study, a 2 hour booster session has been added 6 months after the initial workshop</description>

    <description>The time and attention control group workshop will be facilitated by a research coordinator. The control group program is based on another program that is designed explore issues related to breast cancer screening among African American women. The program has the same format as the Unity Workshop, with video and group discussion. Although breast cancer may be associated with stigma, we anticipated that breast cancer stigmas would not be related to HIV-associated stigma, which is our primary outcome of interest. The control groups will be held during the same week as the Unity Workshops, and control group participants will complete assessments on the same schedule as the Unity Workshop participants.</description>
