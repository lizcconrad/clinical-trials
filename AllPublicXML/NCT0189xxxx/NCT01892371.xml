  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase 1 part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable
      dose of AC220 (quizartinib) that can be given with either 5-azacitidine (azacitidine) or
      cytarabine to patients with AML or MDS.

      The goal of the Phase 2 part of the study is to learn if quizartinib with either azacitidine
      or cytarabine can help to control AML or MDS. The safety of these combinations will also be
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Quizartinib is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Cytarabine and azacitidine are FDA
      approved and commercially available for certain types of MDS and AML. The study drug
      combinations are investigational.

      Up to 72 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to receive
      quizartinib with azacitidine or cytarabine. Your doctor will decide which drugs you will
      receive.

      You will be assigned to a study phase based on when you join this study. Up to 2 groups of
      about 12 participants will be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study, and up to 52
      participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

      If you are enrolled in the Phase 1 portion, the dose of quizartinib and cytarabine or
      azacitidine you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level of quizartinib and cytarabine or azacitidine.
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of study drugs than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of
      the study drugs is found.

      If you are enrolled in the Phase 2 portion, you will receive quizartinib and cytarabine or
      azacitidine at the highest dose that was tolerated in the Phase 1 portion.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is about 4 weeks long, but may be longer depending on how the disease
      responds to the study drugs.

      You will take the tablet form of quizartinib by mouth 1 time every day. You should take it at
      about the same time every day, on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a
      meal in the morning). During the first cycle only, you will not take it on Days 1-4. If you
      miss a dose or vomit a dose, the next dose should not be increased to make up for the missed
      dose. You should take the next regular dose at the scheduled time.

      If you are taking azacitidine, you will receive it by vein over 10-40 minutes or by a needle
      under the skin 1 time a day on Days 1-7. The azacitidine doses are given in the clinic.

      If you are taking cytarabine, you will receive it by a needle under the skin 2 times a day on
      Days 1-10. You will be taught how to give the cytarabine doses to yourself.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 and then every 2-3 cycles until the end of Month 6, you will have
      a physical exam.

      One (1) time a week during Cycles 1-3 and then every 2-4 weeks until the end of Month 6,
      blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 1-3 cycles until the end of Month 6, you will have a bone
      marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease

      On Days 1, 5, 8, and 12 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, and then every 2-3 cycles until
      the end of Month 6, you may have 1 or 2 sets of EKGs. You may not have the EKG at all of
      these times, depending on the time of your last quizartinib dose. You may have additional
      EKGs, depending on the dose of study drug you are receiving.

      After Month 6, the following tests and procedures will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      Every 6-12 months after Month 6, or more often if your doctor thinks it is needed, you will
      have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.

      If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have extra clinic visits, tests, and
      procedures.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are not able to follow the study directions.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 2 dose levels of AC220 will be tested in each combination with a fixed dose of the other drug. Initially, 6 patients will be treated at dose level -1, if &lt;/=1 patients experience DLT at dose level -1, then 6 subsequent patients will be treated at the next higher dose level, dose level 0. If &lt;/=1 patients experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in dose level 0, this level will be defined as the MTD and will be used in the phase II portion of the study. If &gt;1 patients experience DLTs at dose level -1, then the 6 subsequent patients will be treated at the next lower dose level, level -2. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 patient experiences DLTs. For each combination therapy, 12 patients will be evaluated. The total sample size for the phase I portion will be 24.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For Phase I Only: Refractory or relapsed disease defined as follows: Patients with MDS
             or CMML should have failed prior therapy (e.g., with a hypomethylating agent,

             induction therapy or have relapsed after prior therapy; Patients (any age) with MDS or
             CMML who received therapy with a hypomethylating agent and progress to AML are
             eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML regardless any prior therapy for AML. The WHO
             classification will be used for AML; Patients with any of the eligible diagnoses who
             have received no prior therapy are eligible if not candidates to receive standard
             intensive therapy (ie, high-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy).

             older and with refractory or relapse disease who have received no more than one prior
             treatment regimen and will be receiving first salvage. For this purposes, a second
             induction cycle with the same drugs used during the first cycle, consolidation
             chemotherapy or stem cell transplant in CR (or CRp or CRi) will be considered part of
             the prior regimen. Prior therapy for MDS (or other malignancies) is not considered a
             prior regimen for AML in patients who progress from MDS (or other malignancies).;

         11. For Phase I and II: Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to
             entering this study, unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease, and must
             have recovered from the toxic effects of that therapy to at least grade 1. Use of
             hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the
             start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy. The additional days of
             Hydrea after 28 is permitted as clinically indicated, on case by case basis after
             discussion with the PI. Other agents given transiently with the intention to control
             rapid proliferation such as 1-2 doses of single agent ara-C or few doses of sorafenib
