  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities of onartuzumab as single agent or in combination with sorafenib in
      participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive
      onartuzumab as single agent on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Participants in Cohorts 2 or 3
      will receive onartuzumab on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in combination with sorafenib 400 mg
      orally daily or twice daily. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
