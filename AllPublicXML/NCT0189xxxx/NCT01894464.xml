      teacher-led interventions that are individualized to meet student needs.

      The Early Truancy Prevention Project is an innovative intervention program designed to
      prevent elementary school truancy and later school dropout. The intervention model emphasizes
      the important role of teachers as change agents to address early attendance problems and
      emerging truancy. Specifically, the goals of this pilot project are: 1) to facilitate
      positive, trusting, and collaborative home-school relations and to promote a positive
      teacher-child relationship; 2) to provide teachers with timely information about a student's
      attendance pattern; and 3) to train and supervise teachers in the implementation of
      individualized attendance interventions to improve student attendance and prevent emerging
      truancy among elementary school students. As this is a pilot study, another important goal is
      to obtain teacher and administrator feedback to improve and refine all aspects of the
      project.
