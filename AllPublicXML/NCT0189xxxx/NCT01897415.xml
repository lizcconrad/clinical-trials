    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I safety and feasibility study. Subjects will be enrolled serially. For
      subject safety, the preceding subject must have completed one cycle of therapy (28 days)
      before the next subject can be treated. Subjects will be treated with i.v. administration of
      1 to 3e8 per meter squared RNA CAR T cells three times weekly (M-W-F) for three weeks.

      This phase I study is being conducted to establish safety and feasibility of intravenous (IV)
      RNA mesothelin re-directed autologous T cell administration in patients with
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Subjects will be enrolled serially. For subject safety, the preceding subject must have
      completed therapy and be 28 days from their last infusion before the next subject can be
      treated.. Subjects will be treated with IV administration of 1 to 3e8/m2 RNA CAR T cells
      three times weekly (M-W-F) for three weeks.

      Main eligibility criteria: Subjects with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)
      who have chemotherapy-refractory disease. Inclusion criteria include patients older than 18
      years of age diagnosed with metastatic PDA with ECOG 0-1 performance status and 3 month
      expected survival. Exclusion criteria include a pericardial effusion, active autoimmune
      disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active anti-coagulation therapy, known HIV or
      HTLV I/II positivity, prior treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies or history of allergy
      to murine proteins.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease and failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy for
             metastatic disease.

          -  Subjects must have measureable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          -  Satisfactory organ and bone marrow function

          -  Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is
             less than or equal to 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a subject
             is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin for management of venous thrombosis
             including pulmonary thromboembolus) and a PTT less than or equal to 1.2 time the upper
             limit of normal.

          -  Subjects must have adequate venous peripheral access for apheresis. Patients must also
             have adequate venous access for subsequent modified CAR T cell administration which
             can be done through a central venous access (e.g. port for systemic chemotherapy)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide written informed consent.

          -  Short-term therapy for acute conditions not specifically related to pancreatic cancer
             is allowed if such therapy does not include immune modulating agents.

          -  Male and Female subjects agree to use approved contraceptive methods (e.g. birth
             control pills, barrier device, intrauterine device, abstinence) during the study and
             for 3 months following the last dose of the study cell infusion.

          -  Subject must understand and sign the study-specific informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participated in any other trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug
             occurred within 28 days (42 days for non-murine monoclonal antibodies) prior to entry
             into the study.

          -  Received any anticancer medication in the 2 weeks (i.e. 14 days) prior to receiving
             their first dose of study treatment and no other concurrent chemotherapy or
             immunotherapy (e.g. monoclonal antibodies)

          -  Active invasive cancer other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with active
             non-invasive cancers (such as non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial cervical and
             bladder and prostate cancer with PSA level less than 1.0) are not excluded.

          -  Known HIV, HCV, and HBV positive

          -  Active autoimmune disease (including but not limited to: systemic lupus
             erythromatosis, Sjogrens syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple
             sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) requiring immunosuppressive therapy
             within the past 4 weeks, with exception of thyroid replacement.

          -  Patients with ongoing or active infection.

          -  Planned concurrent treatment with systemic high dose corticosteroids.

          -  Prior gene therapy or therapy with murine monoclonal antibodies or products of murine
             origin.

          -  Concurrent treatment with any anticancer agent.

          -  History of allergy to murine proteins

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40)

          -  Any clinically significant pericardial effusion; CHF (NY Heart Association Grade
             II-IV) or cardiovascular condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin
             induced pericarditis.

          -  Subjects on active anti-coagulation therapy.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because autologous transduced T cells may
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, secondary to
             treatment of the mother with autologous transduced T cells, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated.

          -  Feasibility assessment demonstrates less than 20% transfection of target lymphocytes
             or insufficient expansion of modified CAR T cells to complete 9 infusions.
