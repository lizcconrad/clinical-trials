    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Ashworth Scale (AS) Score of Plantar Flexors of the Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First Injection Cycle (1st IC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (= no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. &quot;primary body side&quot; was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measurement) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

    <measure>Co-primary Variable: Investigator's Global Impression of Change of Plantar Flexor Spasticity Scale (GICS-PF) of the Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First Injection Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is classified as co-primary to satisfy a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) request. The GICS-PF scale is a 7-Point Likert Scale for the assessment of the functional change due to treatment of plantar flexor spasticity only. Ranges from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. &quot;primary body side&quot; was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively.

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Modified Tardieu Scale [MTS] of Plantar Flexors of Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 85 (Week 12) of the First and of the Second Injection Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4, 8, and 12 of 1st IC and 2nd IC (Week 16-40, 20-44 and 24-48)</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) assesses spastic muscle tone by subtraction of two angles measured at different conditions of passive muscle stretch. R2 is the angle of passive range of motion with a passive movement at slow speed. R1 is the angle where a &quot;catch-and-release&quot; or clonus can be triggered at the fastest possible speed. Score values represent the measured (R2-R1) difference, i.e. the dynamic tone component of the examined muscle(s). Decreases of (R2-R1) represent reductions in the dynamic component of spasticity, i.e. improvement of dynamic muscle spasticity.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the model used for comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Ashworth Scale (AS) Score of Plantar Flexors of the Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First Injection Cycle (1st IC)</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (= no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measurement) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>Co-primary Variable: Investigator's Global Impression of Change of Plantar Flexor Spasticity Scale (GICS-PF) of the Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First Injection Cycle</title>
        <description>This variable is classified as co-primary to satisfy a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) request. The GICS-PF scale is a 7-Point Likert Scale for the assessment of the functional change due to treatment of plantar flexor spasticity only. Ranges from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

          <title>Co-primary Variable: Investigator's Global Impression of Change of Plantar Flexor Spasticity Scale (GICS-PF) of the Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First Injection Cycle</title>
          <description>This variable is classified as co-primary to satisfy a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) request. The GICS-PF scale is a 7-Point Likert Scale for the assessment of the functional change due to treatment of plantar flexor spasticity only. Ranges from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and Week 4 resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>
          <population>FAS population is subset in the SES for whom the primary efficacy variable (participants who had at least an AS score of plantar flexor at baseline [Day 1] or the investigator’s GICS-PF [for participants with bilateral treatment on same body side] at Day 29 [Week 4] of the first injection cycle) were available.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the AS Score of Plantar Flexors of the Nonprimary Body Side in Participants With Bilateral Treatment at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First (1st) and Second Injection Cycle (2nd IC)</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measurement) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in AS Score of Plantar Flexors of the Primary Body Side at Day 57 (Week 8) and Day 85 (Week 12) of the First and of the Second Injection Cycle</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measurement) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

          <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measurement) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.
KF = Knee Flexors; TA = Thigh Adductors; w = week.</description>
          <population>FAS population is subset in the SES for whom the primary efficacy variable (participants who had at least an AS score of plantar flexor at baseline [Day 1] or the investigator’s GICS-PF [for participants with bilateral treatment on same body side] at Day 29 [Week 4] of the first injection cycle) were available.</population>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in Modified Tardieu Scale [MTS] of Plantar Flexors of Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 85 (Week 12) of the First and of the Second Injection Cycle</title>
        <description>The Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) assesses spastic muscle tone by subtraction of two angles measured at different conditions of passive muscle stretch. R2 is the angle of passive range of motion with a passive movement at slow speed. R1 is the angle where a &quot;catch-and-release&quot; or clonus can be triggered at the fastest possible speed. Score values represent the measured (R2-R1) difference, i.e. the dynamic tone component of the examined muscle(s). Decreases of (R2-R1) represent reductions in the dynamic component of spasticity, i.e. improvement of dynamic muscle spasticity.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the model used for comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <description>The Global Impression of Change Scales (GICS) are global outcomes to assess the impression of change due to treatment. GICS were assessed by the investigator, by the participant (if feasible) and by parents'/caregiver (if applicable). GICS are 7-Point Likert Scales ranging from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function).
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measurement) models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>Investigator's Global Impression of Change of GICS-Plantar-Flexor of Primary Body Side at Day 29 (Week 4) of the First and Second Injection Cycle</title>
        <description>The GICS are global outcomes to assess the impression of change due to treatment. GICS were assessed by the investigator, by the participant (if feasible) and by parents'/caregiver (if applicable). GICS are 7-Point Likert Scales ranging from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for primary efficacy analysis i.e. “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. For participants with unilateral treatment, the treated body side was kept throughout the entire study.
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in Gross Motor Function Measure [GMFM]-66 Score at the End of First Injection Cycle and at the End of Study Visit</title>
        <description>The GMFM-66 is a standardized observational 66-item instrument designed and validated to measure change in gross motor function over time in participants with cerebral palsy. Score values represent the total GMFM-66 score. Total GMFM scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).
Values represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.</description>
