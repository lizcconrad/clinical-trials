  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration training seems to be a useful adjunct in exercise training in patients
      with severe COPD. The basic principle relies on reflectory muscle contractions caused by a
      vibration stimulus. Until now the impact of whole body vibration training on cardiopulmonary
      parameters remained unknown. Therefore aim of this study is to investigate cardiopulmonary
      parameters during whole body vibration training in patients with chronic lung disease.
