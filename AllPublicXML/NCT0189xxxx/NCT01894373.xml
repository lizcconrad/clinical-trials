        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have ever had a physician's diagnosis of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis
             and be a candidate for treatment with CIK Are being treated with or initiating CIK
             therapy at the time of enrollment Be able to provide written informed consent Be
             willing and able to fully to participate for the duration of patient follow-up (5
             years)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  PUVA or Grenz ray therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomisation. UVB therapy within 2
             weeks prior to randomisation. Systemic treatment with biological therapies (marketed
             or otherwise) with a possible effect on psoriasis (e.g., alefacept, efalizumab,
             etanercept, infliximab) within 3 months prior to randomisation.

        Systemic treatment other than biologicals with a possible effect on psoriasis (e.g.,
        corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids, hydroxycarbamide, azathioprine,
        meth-otrexate, cyclosporine, other immunosuppressants) within 4 weeks prior to
        randomisation.

        Any topical treatment of the scalp (except for medicated shampoos and emollients) within 2
        weeks prior to randomisation (medicated shampoos/emollients are not allowed during the
        double-blind phase). Shampoos containing corticosteroids, e.g. Clobex®, are not allowed
        within 2 weeks prior to randomisation.

        Planned use of topical treatment for psoriasis of the trunk or limbs, besides study
        medication, during the study with the exceptions of: • emollient • medications used to
        treat psoriasis of the skin folds and/or genitals (any medication may be used for this
        purpose apart from Class 1-5 corticosteroids.

        Topical treatment of the face with Class 1-5 corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to
        randomisation.

        Planned initiation of, or changes to, concomitant medication that could affect psoriasis
        (e.g., beta blockers, anti-malaria drugs, lithium) during the double-blind phase of the
        study.

        Treatment with any non-marketed drug substance (i.e., an agent which has not yet been made
        available for clinical use following registration) within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.

        Planned use of chemical treatments of the hair (eg relaxers, 'perms', or colourings) during
        the double-blind phase of the study.

        Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis. Patients with any of
        the following conditions also present on psoriatic areas of the scalp or trunk/limbs: viral
        (e.g. herpes or varicella) lesions of the skin, fungal or bacterial skin infections,
        parasitic infections, skin manifestations in relation to tuberculosis or syphilis, rosacea,
        acne rosacea, acne vulgaris, atrophic skin, striae atrophicae, fragility of skin veins,
        ichthyosis, ulcers or wounds.

        Other inflammatory skin diseases that may confound the evaluation of psoriasis of the scalp
        or trunk/limbs.
