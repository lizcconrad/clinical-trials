  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a 3-year extension to the phase III core study CAIN457F2306. It
      aims to provide continuous treatment with secukinumab in pre-filled syringes (PFS) for
      subjects who completed the core study CAIN457F2306, to obtain further long term efficacy,
      safety and tolerability information in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis receiving
      secukinumab every 4 weeks. At Week 104 of the study CAIN457F2306, eligible subjects will
      complete the assessments associated with the core study visit and will subsequently continue
      in the extension study on the same dose that they were receiving during the core study. The
      regular assessments of disease activity will ensure that subjects who are experiencing
      worsening of disease in any of the treatment groups can exit the study upon their own wish or
      based on the advice of the investigator at any time.

    <description>Proportion of subjects that have a positive clinical response to treatment (individual improvement) in disease activity according to ACR20 (or ACR50 or ACR 70) criteria if he/she has at least 20 % (or 50% or 70%) improvement in 1. Tender 68-joint count 2. Swollen 66-joint count and 3. At least 3 of the following 5 measures: o Patient's assessment of RA pain o Patient's global assessment of disease activity o Physician's global assessment of disease activity o Subject self-assessed disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ-DI] score) o Acute phase reactant (hsCRP or ESR)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the entire duration of the study up to Week 260</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in score of the disability assessment component of the HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index). The HAQ-DI, assesses a subject's level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities.</description>

    <measure>Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the entire duration of the study up to Week 260</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects with improvements from baseline in HAQ-DI meeting or exceeding minimal clinically important difference (MCID). The HAQ-DI, assesses a subject's level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the entire duration of the study up to Week 260</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in DAS28 (utilizing hsCRP) from baseline to over entire study duration up to Month 60. The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in RA based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts (out of a total of 28), hsCRP and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, equal to or less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjects achieving low disease activity and disease remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the entire duration of the study up to Week 260</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects achieving low disease activity (DAS28 ≤ 3.2) and disease remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6). The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in RA based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts (out of a total of 28), hsCRP and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, equal to or less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission</description>

    <description>Secukinumab is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to unique proteins that your body produces. Secukinumab binds and reduces the activity of a cytokine (a &quot;messenger&quot; protein in the body) called Interleukin 17 (IL-17).</description>
