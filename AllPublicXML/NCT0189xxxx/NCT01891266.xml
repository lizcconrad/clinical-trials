  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease that causes symptomatic health problems
      in the elderly population. For some patients with knee OA, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may
      be the only option that offers the possibility of reestablishing the patient's life quality.

      Surgery of TKA usually takes place in a complete bloodless field established by a tourniquet
      around the thigh. The method aims to reduce blood loss and give the surgeon better visibility
      during the operation. The method is, however, not without side effects as patients often
      experience severe pain and swollen leg in the time after surgery. Furthermore, has the method
      shown decidedly muscle- and nerve damage followed by prolonged rehabilitation and reduced
      physical function.

      It is, however, possible to perform the operation without the use of the tourniquet.

      Aim and hypothesis:

      The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of tourniquet use in TKA on physical
      function, early rehabilitation, pain and opioid consumption.

      Hypotheses H1: TKA without tourniquet leads to better physical function and early
      rehabilitation.

      H2: TKA without tourniquet causes less pain and opioid consumption H3: Recovery of mechanical
      lower limb function post TKA is faster without use of tourniquet.

      Methods:

      80 patients (40 in each group) all eligible for TKA will be consecutively recruited and
      randomized to A) TKA without tourniquet, B) TKA with tourniquet. Subjects will be evaluated
      before the operation (baseline) and 14 days, 3, 6 and 12 months after the operation.

      The primary outcome will be the change from baseline to 3 months in self-administered
      knee-function (KOOS-ADL subscale). Further, will we examine a number of pre-specified
      secondary outcomes, which include self-rated knee-related pain, symptoms, difficulty with
      sports and leisure activities, and quality of life. In addition, muscle function, physical
      performance, and the use of pain medication will be studied

      Impact of the project:

      The project design of this study will enable analyses for determining the impact of operating
      without tourniquet and whether such an intervention can in fact improve physical function,
      performance and quality of life within TKA patients. The results may impact notably on the
      patient level and possible redefine current surgical strategies. The societal perspective of
      the project is to remobilize patients faster, which may reduce hospital services and absence
      from work.

    <description>Further assessments: Baseline, 14 days and a 6 and 12 months follow up. KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measure with good evidence of reliability, validity and responsiveness in different population with varying pathologies, injury durations, and activity levels (http://www.koos.nu).</description>

    <description>In addition to pain and physical function the assessment by the patient of a global perceived effect of the treatment is a recommended responder criterion [4]. Patients will be asked to rate possible change in their condition since the initial administration (baseline) on a 7-point Likert-scale.</description>

Self-reported use of pain medication: The patient's use of pain medication will be registered.</description>

    <description>Two muscle biopsy samples (2 * 100 mg) will be acquired in a subgroup of the patients (2 x 10) during operation. One sample will be collected prior to applying the tourniquet, and a second sample will be collected prior to the removal of the tourniquet. Muscle tissue is frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent for analysis at the Institute of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics for mechanical characteristics, Ca2+-kinetics and markers of free oxygen radicals.</description>
