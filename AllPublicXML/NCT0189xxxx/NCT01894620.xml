  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being conducted to study whether rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation) could be potentially used as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. rTMS is a
      technique that stimulates the brain by rapidly switching a magnetic field in a coil placed
      over your head. Prior to rTMS, single pulse TMS will be used to localize the specific brain
      region that we are interested in.

      Upon meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed consent, each participant will
      complete a series of cognitive assessments and rTMS treatments at the TMS Lab at Riverview
      Health Center. Each treatment session will involve implementing rTMS, while the patient is
      involved in a cognitive exercise such as naming object or action. The study sessions will be
      scheduled as follows: Block 1: 5 days/week for two weeks followed by 2 days a week for 1
      week, followed by once a week for 1 week (total of 13 treatments); Pause: 4 weeks of no
      treatment; and Block 2: another 13 sessions of treatment with the same pattern as Block 1.
      One of these two sets of treatment (Block 1 or Block 2) will be sham and one will be real.
      Sham treatment sessions are identical to real treatment sessions, except that there is no
      magnetic stimulation. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either sham or real
      treatment first. The purpose of sham treatment is to have a control group data that the
      plausible improvement as a result of rTMS can be compared to. By designing two sets of
      sham-real or real-sham treatment sessions, every participant will receive a real treatment,
      while we will also have control data.

      The cognitive assessments will be done at the baseline, and then on weekly basis. A subgroup
      of the study population will be recruited for investigating the second objective: effect of
      rTMS on sleep quality. Those patients will be required to sign a second consent; then, the
      patients will go through full-night sleep study at Misericordia Health Center at the same
      time intervals as their cognitive assessments.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals must have a MoCA score between 5 and 26, indicating mild cognitive
             impairment or dementia.

          -  Participants must have probable early or moderate Alzheimer's disease as confirmed by
             their treating neurologist or psychiatrist, and/or by the co-investigators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A recent (the last 3 months) history of stroke, recent (the last 3 months) head injury
             and loss of consciousness, any history of epilepsy, seizures, multiple sclerosis (MS),
             Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or Autism.

          -  Recent changes in medication (i.e. patients should be in a relatively stable phase of
             disease).

          -  The presence of metallic objects in the body; dental implants are fine but people with
             pacemakers are to be excluded; basically anything that is unsafe under MRI would be
             considered unsafe for TMS application.

        <title>Cognitive Improvement Measured Using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</title>
        <description>We anticipate to see a cognitive improvement as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) after two weeks of applying rTMS. This assessment tool gives a score from 0 to 30 points, with higher scores representing better cognitive ability.</description>
        <time_frame>Change between baseline and 2 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
