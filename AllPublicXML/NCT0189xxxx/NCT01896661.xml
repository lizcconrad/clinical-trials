  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension are well-known cardiovascular risk factors. Their
      control could reduce the burden of heart disease across populations. There are several drugs
      to control hypertension, but the only consistently beneficial treatment to reduce apneas is
      continuous positive airway pressure. The demonstration that one drug could improve sleep
      apnea and hypertension would support a novel approach in the treatment of both diseases. The
      role of fluid retention in sleep apnea is known for several decades. The role of diuretics is
      well established in hypertension but was never appropriately tested in sleep apnea. Besides
      to test the efficacy of these drugs, this study will help to understand the mechanisms that
      link hypertension and sleep apnea and its treatment.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial, comparing the association of
      Chlorthalidone plus amiloride 25 and 5 mg daily, versus amlodipine 10 mg daily as first drug
      option in patients older than 40 years of age with Stage I hypertension (140-159/90-99 mmHg)
      and moderate obstructive sleep apnea (15-30 apneas/hour of sleep). The primary outcomes will
      be the variation of apneas/hour and blood pressure. The secondary outcomes will be adverse
      events, somnolence scale (Epworth), ventilatory parameters and C reactive protein. The follow
      up will last 8 weeks. The sample size will be of 29 participants per group. The project was
      approved by the Ethics committee of our institution.
