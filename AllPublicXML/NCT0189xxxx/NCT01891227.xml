  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pretreated, Her2-negative, advanced breast cancer will receive chemotherapy
      with capecitabine and bendamustine for a maximum of eight cycles and afterwards capecitabine
      alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Safety assessments will be
      conducted in 3-weekly intervals, efficacy assessments (CT or MRI) will be conducted every 9
      weeks.

      Aim of this study is to determine whether treatment with capecitabine in combination with
      bendamustine is efficacious and safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 eligible patients will be enrolled. A two-stage design efficacy and safety of bendamustine
      and capecitabine will be evaluated following recruitment of the first 20 patients. Upon
      favorable results a further 20 patients will be recruited to reach the target population of
      40 evaluable patients.

      Pretreatment for eligible patients must include anthracyclines and/or taxanes.

    <description>Overall response rates (complete or partial response, determined by radiologic evaluation according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors - RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) Version 1.1) The study will be stopped after 20 patients if there are fewer than four subjects with an overall response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response). If there are at least four responses an additional 20 subjects will be enrolled and treated till a maximum of 40 subjects. The regimen is concluded to be effective if 13 or more responses out of 40 are observed at the end of the trial.
The last patient is expected to enter the study in Q1 2015, following a 24 month recruitment period. Last Subject Last Visit will be at final staging after end of treatment of last patient. Follow-up after Last Subject Last Visit will be conducted according to local standard of care thereafter, and is not part of study procedures.</description>

    <description>To determine the safety profile of a combination with capecitabine and bendamustine in terms of qualitative and quantitative toxicities from first study treatment dose until completion of study treatment due to progression or for any other reason. All safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication and have at least one post-treatment safety assessment available. The safety population will be used for all safety and tolerability analyses including demographic data, vital signs, laboratory data and adverse events.</description>
