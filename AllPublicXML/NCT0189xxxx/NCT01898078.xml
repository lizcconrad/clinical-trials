  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study with the primary objective of evaluating
      the effect of food on the single-dose PK properties of alisertib administered as the ECT
      formulation. The secondary objective is to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      alisertib.
