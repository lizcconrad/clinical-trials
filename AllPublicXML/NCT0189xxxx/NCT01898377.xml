      In this study we will combine mycophenolate mofetil and imatinib mesylate to treat
      steroid-refractory sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to see
      the response rate and to find the safety of combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic GVHD is one of the most severe forms of the disease and is
      frequently refractory to standard treatment approaches. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in patients with sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic
      GVHD by strongly inhibiting both PDGF (Platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF-β
      (transforming growth factor-β) intracellular signaling, which is responsible for the
      expression of extracellular matrix genes.

      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is one of effective agent for the treatment of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease. MMF is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and hydrolyzed
      to the active metabolite, MPA (mycophenolic acid). MPA selectively inhibits inosine
      monophosphate dehydrogenase, blocking the pathway of purine synthesis in T and B lymphocytes.
      In this study we will combine MMF and imatinib mesylate to treat steroid-refractory
      sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic GVHD to see the response rate and to find the safety of
      combination.

Complete response (CR): Resolution of all signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD
Partial response (PR) : Improvement (at least 1 clinical score reduction, see Appendix 2) in 1 or more organs of involvement and no evidence of worsening in any organ

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of chronic GVHD with fibrotic/scleroderma-like
             features. This diagnosis can be made clinically or by histopathology.

          -  Patients must have active disease with at least one of the following manifestations:
             skin sclerosis, symptomatic bronchiolitis obliterans, extensive lung fibrosis,
             pathologically demonstrated visceral fibrotic involvement of the gut.

          -  Patients with corticosteroid refractory or dependant cGVHD are eligible.
             Steroid-refractory chronic GVHD is defined as chronic GVHD of sustained severity
             during the last full month during which the patients received the equivalent of
             prednisone 0.5 mg/kg or more per day or 1 mg/kg or more every other day.

          -  Age under 21 years old

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the
             study.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events.

          -  Prior treatment with imatinib mesylate or other tyrosine kinase inhibitor after the
             date of transplant.
