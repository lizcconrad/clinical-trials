  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of FF, UMEC and VI administered from one
      inhaler (at two different strengths of UMEC (125 and 62.5microgram [mcg]) and FF/VI
      (ICS/LABA) and UMEC/VI (LAMA/LABA).

      Subjects will receive each of the four treatments once, separated by a wash-out period of
      7-21 days between doses in a four way crossover design. There will be 4 treatment periods in
      total. During each treatment period, subjects will attend the clinical unit on Day -1 for
      standard safety assessments in addition to familiarization with the inhaler. Each subject
      will remain resident in the unit until at least 24 hours after the dose given on Day 1.
      Following completion of all four treatment periods, a follow up visit will take place 7 to 21
      days following the final dose of study medication.

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

        Population

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen at screening and Day -1.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer), or has had exposure to more than four
             new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  The subject is unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges,

             or any fruit juices containing these fruits from 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication and for the duration of the study.
