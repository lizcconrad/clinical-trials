  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an improved corn-soya blend (CSB+) and a
      new formulated ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) are effective in the treatment of
      moderate acute malnutrition in children.

    <textblock>
      Assuming the availability of some food in the household, the caregivers were instructed on
      how best to use the food they have and the quantity of supplementary food distributed was
      calculated to provide about 50% of child energy requirement.
