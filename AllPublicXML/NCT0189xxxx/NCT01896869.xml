  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer with stable disease on
      FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. The main purpose of this study is to compare survival between
      patients that receive ipilimumab and a pancreatic tumor vaccine and patients who continue to
      receive FOLFIRINOX.
