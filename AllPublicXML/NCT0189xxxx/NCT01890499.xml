  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized controlled trial investigating commencement of low residue diet versus
      clear feeds on postoperative day one following elective colorectal surgery, with regards to
      patient tolerability, incidence of nausea and/or vomiting, and postoperative length of
      hospitalization stay.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on current literature, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting varies widely
      and can reach up to 40% in abdominal surgery patients. Thus, patient tolerability to
      postoperative enteral feeds is taken as 60%. This is a superiority trial: group one is the
      clear feeds group and patient tolerability in this group is taken to be 60%. Group two is the
      low residue diet group.

      The primary hypothesis is that the incidence of postoperative ileus is not affected by the
      consistency of enteral diet given, and patients who are placed on low residue diet from
      postoperative day one do not have an increased risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting as
      compared to patients who are placed on clear feeds.

      The primary endpoint measured is Patient tolerability, as evidenced by development of
      vomiting on postoperative day two.
