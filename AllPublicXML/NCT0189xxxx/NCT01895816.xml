      In the last few years, a marked decrease in the quality of semen has been reported.
      Infertility is one of the major health problems in 10 to 15% of couples' lives; from which
      approximately 50% of couple's infertility is due to Male factors. The aim of the present
      study was to evaluate an herbal mixed effects on spermatogenesis and the normal production of
      sperm. Researchers have reported that using antioxidants and vitamins A, B, C, E, flavonoids,
      Sulfur compounds, terpenoids and phenolic compounds in the daily diet can protect sperm. In
      this study the investigators aimed to assess synergistic effect of these herbal compounds in
      male Infertility. 700 mg tablet for 180 consequence days/daily will be advising, for 40
      patients semen samples in 1th and 180 day after treatment will take, in andrology lab
      according WHO method:samples put into 2 mL of medium (Hams F10) containing 0.5% bovine serum
      albumin. After 5 min incubation at 37oC (with 5% CO), the sperm samples were determined using
      the standard haemocytometric method, and sperm motility was analyzed by microscope (Olympus
      IX70) at 10 field and reported as the mean of motile sperm according to WHO methods . The
      sperm abnormality was evaluated according to the standard method of Narayana .Briefly, smears
      of the sperm suspension were made on clean glass slides and stained with periodic
      acid-Schiff's reaction haematoxylin. The stained smears were observed under a light
      microscopic with 40Ã— magnification. The sperms were classified into normal and abnormal. The
      total sperm abnormality was expressed as percentage incidence. Other biochemical tests will
      be doing according the our research protocol and thesis for blood samples for measure LH,
      Testosterone, TAC, Glc and Cholesterol.
