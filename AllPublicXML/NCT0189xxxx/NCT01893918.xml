  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking, the major risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),
      causes systemic effects, such as systemic cellular and humoral inflammation, that could
      substantially contribute to the development of chronic diseases, other than COPD, mainly
      cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. Such chronic comorbidities affect health
      outcomes in COPD, particularly in terms of disease severity and prognosis. The aim of the
      project is to investigate the prevalence of chronic comorbidities associated with COPD and
      their impact on prognosis in elderly patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 100 outpatients, heavy smokers (20 pack/years), older than 65
      years, diagnosed with COPD. COPD is defined by presence of fixed airflow limitation:
      post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)
      less than 70% according to spirometry classification from Global Inititiative for Obstructive
      Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Each patient will be characterized by medical history,
      physical examination, and smoking history. Each patient will perform pulmonary function test,
      including reversibility to inhaled bronchodilator (400 mcg albuterol), and 6-minute walk
      test. Arterial blood gases and routine blood test, including inflammatory biomarkers, will
      also examined. In addition, each patient will undergo chest X-ray, thorax CT scan,
      echocardiography, and carotid ultrasonography.

      At enrollment, all patients will be in stable condition (no changes in medication dosage or
      frequency, no COPD exacerbation or hospital admissions in the previous 4 weeks). Clinical and
      biological follow-up will be prospectively followed for 3 years.
