      We will study the effects of ondansetron on measurements of electrical activity in the heart
      to make sure doses we are using to prevent nausea and vomiting in children receiving
      chemotherapy are safe.

    <textblock>
      Children receiving chemotherapy for cancer at the Jimmy Everest Center for Cancer and Blood
      Disorders in Children also often receive an IV dose of an antiemetic for prophylaxis. The
      most common antiemetics used are in the family of 5HT3 antagonists, specifically granisetron
      and ondansetron. Prior to a recent recommendation by the FDA, we have used ondansetron 0.45
      mg/kg IV. Based on adult ECG data, the recommended dose of ondansetron has been changed to no
      greater than 0.15 mg/kg. We have prior studies showing that the bigger dose is better at
      preventing nausea and vomiting. Therefore we are studying ECG data in patients receiving
      ondansetron and chemotherapy. Each subject will have two identical cycles of chemotherapy.
      Prior to the first of the two cycles they will be randomized to receive one of two doses of
      ondansetron with the first cycle and the other dose with the second cycle. The two doses are
      the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg and a higher dose of 0.3 mg/kg. The dose level the patient
      receives each cycle will be blinded to the investigator and the subject.

      Prior to the first dose of investigational ondansetron, the patient will have an ECG. This
      ECG will be repeated 30 minutes after the ondansetron is administered and just before
      chemotherapy administration, and repeated again 30 minutes later. The change in the QTc
      intervals will be calculated by two independent pediatric cardiologists who are also blinded
      to the ondansetron dose level received. This process will be repeated with the next course of
      chemotherapy, with the second dose of ondansetron. Our goal is to see if there is an
      appreciable difference between the two doses in the QTc interval changes they induce.
