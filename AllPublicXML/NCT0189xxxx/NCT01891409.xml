  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A proof of concept study to evaluate the feasibility of using the Shang Ring, a novel male
      circumcision device across all childhood age groups namely infants (under 1), 1-5 age group,
      6-12 age group and the 13-17 age group. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      course of wound healing when using the Shang Ring technique across the four childhood age
      groups.

      A proof of concept study to evaluate the feasibility of using the Shang Ring, a novel male
      circumcision device across all childhood age groups namely infants (under 1), 1-5 age group,
      6-12 age group and the 13-17 age group. The study will evaluate efficacy, procedure time,
      difficulties during surgery and post-operative events shall be assessed. To evaluate safety,
      the investigators will clinically observe for adverse events during the course of healing.
      The investigators will also evaluate to length of time taken for complete healing to be
      achieved.
