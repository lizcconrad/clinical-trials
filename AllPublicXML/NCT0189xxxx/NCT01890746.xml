  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study is to provide clinical
      safety and exploratory efficacy data on the use of Eltrombopag in adult subjects with Acute
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) receiving standard induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin plus
      cytarabine. These safety data are considered necessary to further development of Eltrombopag
      in both adult and paediatric patients suffering from malignant diseases with secondary
      thrombocytopenia. A minimum of 120 evaluable subjects with newly diagnosed with AML will be
      stratified by antecedent malignant hematologic disorder and age.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time the first dose of study treatment was administered until 30 days following discontinuation of investigational product regardless of initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospice</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 42 of the latest chemotherapy cycle (Up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>LVEF is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving heart each time it contracts. LVEF was assessed by an echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multiple Gated Acquisition scan (MUGA). Baseline was defined as the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 42 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 42 of the latest chemotherapy cycle (Up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with a maximum post-baseline grade increase of Grade 3 (G3) or Grade 4 (G4) from their baseline grade are presented. Hematology parameters included only lab tests that are gradable by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.</description>

    <description>The number of participants with worst case post-baseline changes (normal, abnormal - not clinically significant [NCS], abnormal - clinically significant [NS]) in ECG QT prolonged values are presented. The protocol does not define the criteria for normal, abnormal-NCS and abnormal CS ECG. The outcome was based solely on the investigator interpretation of ECG tracings.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Worst-case Change From Baseline in Pulse Rate Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 42 of the latest chemotherapy cycle (Up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>

             risk if he or she were to participate in the study or would prevent that person from
             giving informed consent.

          -  History of thromboembolic event or other condition requiring ongoing use of
             anticoagulation either with warfarin or low molecular-weight heparin. Note: Occlusion

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever is
             longer, preceding the first dose of study medication.

          -  Current and continued use during study treatment period of known Breast cancer
             resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors or known P-gp inhibitors.

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability.</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>
