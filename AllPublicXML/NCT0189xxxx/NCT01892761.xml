      Adequate exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA) is associated with better outcomes in kidney
      transplantation. This study evaluated repeated, MPA pharmacokinetics (MPA-PK) according to
      post-transplant time-points and concomitant CNIs. Fifty-two patients, 33 allocated to
      tacrolimus (TCL) and 19 to CyA (all with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids), had the
      full MPA area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-12hrs) repeatedly evaluated at days 7,
      14, 30, 60 and 180 post-transplant. MMF daily dose was lower in TCL group as per protocol.
      Dose-adjusted MPA-AUC0-12hrs progressively increased throughout the study period in both
      groups but profiles were different according to the CNI regimen and time. The majority of
      patients were underexposed to MPA on day 7 for both groups what reinforces the need of a
      higher dose in the first week. Dose-adjusted MPA-AUC0-12hrs was higher in TCL group, after
      day 7, due to both a diminished MPA clearance (for both groups) and higher AUC4-12hrs in the
      TCL group. There was a progressive overexposure to MPA in order that at day 180, 21-30% of
      the patients were overexposed to MPA what indicates a time for MPA monitoring and dose
      correction for long-term follow-up. These PK data suggest that changes in MPA profile occur
      according to time and CNIs used and suggests that MPA monitoring may be mandatory at specific
      time-points.

        Male and female patients aged 18-65 years, recipients of a non-HLA identical kidney
        allograft who presented a PRA &lt; 50% were eligible for the MoDIFY trial. Subjects were
        excluded if they received a non-renal organ, had current history of alcohol or illicit drug
        abuse, had liver enzymes more than two times the upper normal limit or received induction
        with anti-lymphocyte preparations.
