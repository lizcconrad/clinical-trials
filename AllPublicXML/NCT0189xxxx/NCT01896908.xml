  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although half of the patients with HF has normal ejection fraction or slightly altered
      (HF-PEF) and the prognosis differs little from those with reduced ejection fraction, the
      pathophysiology of HF-PEF is still poorly understood.

      Sodium restriction is the most common measure of self-care oriented to HF patients for
      management of congestive episodes. The role of this orientation in the treatment of patients
      with preserved ejection fraction, however, is still unclear. The evaluation of the effects of
      sodium restriction on neurohormonal activation and episodes of decompensation in HF-PEF can
      promote a better understanding of the pathophysiological progression of this complex
      syndrome.

      This is a randomized, parallel trial with blinded outcome assessment. The sample will include
      adult patients (aged â‰¥18 years) with a diagnosis of HF-PEF admitted for HF decompensation.
      The patients will be randomized to receive a diet with sodium and fluid intake restricted to
      0.8 g/day and 800 mL/day respectively (intervention group) or an unrestricted diet, with 4
      g/day sodium and unlimited fluid intake (control group), and followed for 7 days or until
      hospital discharge. The primary outcome shall consist of weight loss at 7 days or discharge.
      The secondary outcome includes assessment of clinical stability, neurohormonal activation,
      daily perception of thirst and readmission rate at 30 days.

    <description>Patients that are eligible and fulfill the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate while hospitalized, and then sign the informed consent form. Then, the dietitian on call will be notified in order to change the dietary map of the patients. The prescription diet for both the intervention and control group will be the same: DIET AS RESEARCH PROTOCOL. PATIENT WILL RECEIVE THE DIET UNTIL DAY __ / __ OR DISCHARGE. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IT. This will be combined with the medical staff and with the Nutrition and Dietetics service.
The evaluation of outcomes after hospital discharge will be held in the institution of reference when will be performed clinical evaluation and blood samples collection for neurohormonal activation analysis.</description>
