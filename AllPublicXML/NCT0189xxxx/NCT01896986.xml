  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2007-2009 the investigators conducted a study to determine the immunogenicity response to
      HPV vaccine in special risk patients known to be at increased risk of abnormal cervical
      cytology. The serological response to the vaccine was measured 1 month post the third and
      final dose (n=70) finding a robust response overall.

      The aim of this follow-on study is to provide data on the long-term protection offered by the
      HPV vaccination. The persistence of antibody 5 years post immunisation is unknown and the
      impact on cervical cytology abnormalities in these special risk groups is important.

      The study results will help inform national immunisation program recommendations re- booster
      HPV vaccine doses.

      This study is an open interventional study based at two paediatric tertiary centres in
      Melbourne, Australia. It is specifically looking at the long term immunogenic response to the
      4 valent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) Gardasil in paediatric rheumatology disease (PRD) and Irritable
      bowel disease (IBD) in participants who complete the primary HPV immunological study.

      The study participant's response to the vaccine will be compared to Merck historical
      age-matched controls as there is currently no serological correlate of protection for the HPV
      vaccine.

      The participants have already received the vaccine as part of the Australian federally funded
      catch up program which will run until mid-2009. All participants are part of 'Special risk
      groups'; which as defined by the Australian Immunisation Handbook, as patients who may have:

        1. special vaccination needs (e.g. children/ adolescents with a chronic medical condition)
           ; or

        2. a suboptimal response to vaccination (e.g. due to impaired immunity); or

        3. an increased risk of adverse events following immunization (AEFI)

      The 'special risk groups' currently included in the study are:

        1. PRD- Paediatric Rheumatological Diseases

        2. IBD- Inflammatory Bowel Disease

      Number of participants

      Total number of patients to be recruited is N = 60

      The aim is to recruit n= 45 patients from PRD and n=15 patients from IBD.

      Immunisation history will be correlated with the HPV register.

      Main outcome measures

      The primary immunogenicity endpoint will be serum antibody by month 60 (i.e. 5 years post 3rd
      and final dose of 4vHPV vaccine).

      Antibody titres are determined by using type-specific competitive neutralising antibody to
      epitopes on virus like particles (VLP). This will be for each of the 4 serotypes in the
      vaccine [6,11,16,18], with geometric mean titre (GMT) will be measured in mMU; and will be
      compared with GMT from historical age-matched controls.

      Frequency of assessment

      There will only be one immunogenicity assessment point, 60 month post the third and final
      dose of 4vHPV vaccine.

      Primary Objective:

      • Long term immunogenicity of the quadrivalent 4/6/11/18 HPV vaccine Gardasil® by following
      up a cohort of adolescent females aged 16-30 years with PRD or IBD, 5 years post HPV
      vaccination at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) Melbourne. Antibody titres are determined
      by using type specific neutralizing antibody.The geometric mean titre (GMT) will be measured
      in mMU; with a type specific cutoff for the assay (&gt; 20mMU/ml for the HPV6; &gt; 16mMU/ml for
      the HPV11; &gt; 20mMU/ml for the HPV16 and &gt;24mMU/ml for the HPV18). [13,15] HPV serology will
      be performed using competitive Luminex based immunoassays.

      Secondary Objective:

      • The safety of the HPV vaccine in the 2 (PRD, IBD) study groups, measured by the number of
      adverse events reported by study participants.

        In 2007 we began a clinical audit of the 'special risk patients' within two subgroups
        (PRD&amp;IBD). From April 2007- March 2010 there were 64 special risk female participants
        including 38 PRD patients of which 28 had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The other
        subgroups included: 14 IBD; 10 paediatric cancer; 1 SOTR (solid organ transplant recipient)
        and 1 CRD (Chronic Renal Disease). The median age at the first dose of 4vHPV vaccine
        administration was 14.7 years [range 11.8 to 24.7].

        The overall results were good with all participants showing at least some level of antibody
        protection against HPV.

        Long-term follow-up will help determine the requirement for booster vaccine doses,
        including those patients treated with combination immunosuppressive therapies.
