      This open-label, single-arm, multicenter study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      Zelboraf (vemurafenib) in patients with Braf V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma.
      Patients will receive Zelboraf 960 mg twice a day until progressive disease, unacceptable
      toxicity, consent withdrawal, death, reasons deemed by the treating physician or study
      termination.

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (surgically incurable and
             unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV; AJCC) with documented BRAF V600 mutation
             determined by the cobasÂ® BRAF V600 Mutation Test prior to administration of
             vemurafenib. Unresectable stage IIIC disease must have confirmation from a surgical
             oncologist

          -  Patients with either measurable or non-measurable disease (RECIST Version 1.1)

          -  Patients may or may not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Patients must have recovered from all side effects of their most recent systemic or
             local treatment for metastatic melanoma

          -  Adequate hematological, renal, and liver function

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening

          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective form of contraception during the study and
             for at least 6 months after completion of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of symptomatic CNS lesions as determined by the investigator, use of steroid
             or anti-seizure medication for treatment of brain metastases prior to the first
             administration of vemurafenib

          -  Patients with previous malignancies (other than melanoma) within the past 2 years
             except patients with treated and controlled basal or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of
             the skin or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix.

          -  Concurrent administration of any anti-cancer therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, other
             targeted therapy, experimental drug, etc.) other than those administered in this study

          -  Known hypersensitivity to vemurafenib or another BRAF inhibitor

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant
             bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption.

          -  Any of the following within the 6 months prior to the first vemurafenib
             administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack, pulmonary
             embolism, hypertension not adequately controlled by current medications.
