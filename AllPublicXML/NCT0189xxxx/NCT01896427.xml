  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth should be extracted. Surgical extraction of these
      impacted third molars may provide special complication as pain, swelling, and trismus. In
      previous studies, some techniques as sutureless flap closure, modified flap designing,
      antibiotic usage, and injection of corticosteroids were presented. These methods are reducing
      post operative complications to moderate level. In this study, pain, swelling, trismus,
      general patients' satisfaction, and associated quality of life after the surgical removal of
      third mandibular impacted molars will be compared while injection of dexamethasone (8mg) does
      not need excessive time, effort, and equipments and it will be injected in numbness area into
      medial pterygoid muscle and pterygomandibular space to current corticosteroid injecting
      non-corticosteroid methods. To achieve this aim, 75 non pregnant participants have single
      impacted mandibular third molar in healthy and without pericoronitis manner, after provision
      of written informed consent will be entered to the study. During the study, unwilling
      participants to continue the study and those with abnormality of wound healing process will
      be excluded. The included participants will be assigned into three 25-people groups. The
      surgeries were done by 3 same instructed experienced oral and maxillofacial residents. After
      the surgery pain, swelling, trismus, general patients' satisfaction, and associated quality
      of life were evaluated using interview of questionnaire in 48 hour, 96 hour, and one week
      period of time. The comparison was done between these three groups.
