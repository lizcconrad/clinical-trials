    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies levocarnitine in treating patients with
      vismodegib-associated muscle spasms. Levocarnitine may decrease muscle spasms caused by
      vismodegib.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of levocarnitine on muscle spasm frequency compared to placebo
      (median percentage comparison)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess intensity of muscle spasms after levocarnitine compared to placebo.

      II. To assess responses related to activities of daily living or psychosocial function after
      levocarnitine compared to placebo.

      III. To assess the number of body locations affected by muscle spasms after levocarnitine or
      placebo.

      IV. To assess the frequency and severity of all adverse effects on levocarnitine versus
      placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive levocarnitine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) during weeks 1-4. Washout
      is from weeks 5-8. Patients then cross-over to placebo PO twice daipy for weeks 9-12.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO twice daily during weeks 1-4. Washout is from weeks 5-8.
      Patients then cross-over to levocarnitine for weeks 9-12.
