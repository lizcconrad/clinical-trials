  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is one of the prime factors of long-term health protection in newborns, for
      nutritional, immunological and developmental reasons. In France there is a wide
      inter-regional variability of breastfeeding rates at discharge. This variability associates
      different factors involving both, mothers, birth conditions, newborns and mother-child
      couple. Some approaches, including osteopathy, aim to support early breastfeeding
      difficulties. As many others non-conventional medicines, there is a huge and growing interest
      for this alternative therapy and a spontaneous recourse in the first months of life.
      Nevertheless, neither efficacy nor the benefits have been studied. Thus, our objective is to
      evaluate for the first time in France, in a randomized, double-blinded design, the efficacy
      of early osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), in suboptimal breastfeeding behaviour
      healthy newborns.

      128 couples mother-child will be randomized in two groups: with or without osteopathic
      intervention on the newborn.

To keep the blinded procedure the interventions will be realized behind a screen, allowing interactions with parents but depriving their visibility.
A telephone contact will be perform at M1 (one month of life) to assess breastfeeding persistence and collect questionnaire data.
Two others telephone contacts will be perform at 3 months and 6 months to precise breastfeeding interruption date.

Newborn will be undressed, lying naked (covered with polar sheet) on the exam table, dissimulated to parents by adequate screen. The osteopathic procedure will take place on a dolly to mimic from an indiscernible manner, osteopathic management.
