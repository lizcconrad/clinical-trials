  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dumping Syndrome consists of (1) a too rapid gastric emptying, (2) an inappropriate release
      of GI hormones (as a reaction to the hyperosmolar contents in the duodenum) and (3) an
      hyperinsulinemic response to a too rapid absorption of glucose. Because it is not well known
      which somatostatin receptor(s) (sst1-5) influence(s) Dumping Syndrome most, the goal of this
      trial is to evaluate :

        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the control of gastric emptying.

        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the release of GI hormones (during
           OGTT).

        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the hyperinsulimic response (during
           OGTT).

        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of objective parameters
           of Dumping Syndrome (hematocrit (Hct), pulse rate and occurrence of hypoglycemia after
           an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with 75g of glucose)

        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of overall symptoms as
           measured by the combined Dumping Syndrome score

        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of symptoms as measured
           by (a) early and (b) late phase dumping symptom score separately

        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of quality of life (QoL
           SF-36)

      This will be a single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled cross-over study during 35
      days.

      After a 4 weeks screening period, patients who fulfill the entrance criteria will be randomly
      assigned on a 1:1 basis to either the pasireotide treatment arm or to the placebo treatment
      arm. They will be treated with pasireotide sc or placebo sc for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks,
      patients will be switched to the other treatment arm after a 7 days wash out period. This
      phase is double-blind: both the patient and investigator will be blinded to treatment
      assignment.

    <description>The dumping score is the sum of the early and late dumping symptoms. Early dumping starts immediately after a meal, within 1 hour (&lt; 1 hour). Late dumping starts later than 1 hour after a meal (≥ 1 hour). In case a symptom starts immediately after a meal and lasts longer than 1 hour, the score for early AND late dumping should be ticked.
