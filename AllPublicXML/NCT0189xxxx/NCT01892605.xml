    <textblock>
      Music has a long history in healing physical and mental illness. The Mozart effect was
      initially reported by Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky in the journal of &quot;Nature&quot; in the year of 1993.
      They examined performance on Stanford-Binet spatial tasks immediately following either 10
      minutes of listening to Mozart's sonata K.448, silence, or instruction to relax. They found
      the performance scores were 9 point higher in Mozart-listening group than other two groups.
      Later, the beneficial influence of Mozart music on parkinson's disease, epilepsy, senile
      dementia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was reported. However, the real
      neurophysiological mechanism of the influence remains unclear.

      Epilepsy is a common disorder in the field of pediatric neurology. Although we had greatly
      advanced in develop of new anticonvulsant, thirty percent of patients with epilepsy have
      drug-resistance, which is associated with an increased risk of debilitating psychosocial
      consequences. In addition, the adverse effects of anticonvulsants are not uncommon. Few
      reports demonstrated that patients exposed to Mozart's music can significantly decrease in
      seizure frequencies and interictal epileptiform discharge. However, the case number of these
      studies was limited and the mechanisms of music therapy on epilepsy were not well known. In
      our recent studies, Mozart's music indeed decreased the epileptifrom discharge in the
      patients with epilepsy, particularly in the patients with generalized discharge and central
      discharge. On the basis of these encouraging results, we will try to investigate the neural
      mechanisms and clinical applications of music therapy in the following three years.

      In the first year of our study, we use animal model to examine the possible mechanism of
      Mozart's effect. The aim of the second year study is investigation the effect of music on the
      cortical functions in the epileptic rat model. According to our previous study, Mozart's
      sonata K.448 was effective in reducing epileptiform discharge. On the basis of previous
      two-year results, the patients with epilepsy will be enrolled in the third year project to
      perform an individualized music therapy. In this study, we can provide an alternative therapy
      in the patients of epilepsy and investigate the possible biological mechanism of music
      effect.

      Children with first unprovoked seizure were investigated.Patients were randomly classified
      into treatment and control groups. They did not receive AED after their first unprovoked
      seizure. The treatment group listened to Mozart K.448 for eight minutes once daily before
      bedtime for at least six months.All of the patients received follow-up telephone calls
      monthly. Patients who experienced seizure recurrence were advised to begin AED treatment.
