  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>End of Day Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>End of Day Comfort will be assessed by the participant as a retrospective, bilateral evaluation of 1 week of wear. End of Day Comfort will be graded on a 1-10 scale (10=cannot be felt, 1=painful).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Comfort will be assessed by the participant as a retrospective, bilateral evaluation of 1 week of wear. Overall Comfort will be graded on a 1-10 scale (10=cannot be felt, 1=painful).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Handling at Time of Removal</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Handling at Time of Removal will be assessed by the participant as a retrospective, bilateral evaluation of 1 week of wear. Overall Handling at Time of Removal will be graded on a 1-10 scale (10=excellent, very easy; 1=unmanageable).</description>
