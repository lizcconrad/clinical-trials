      Safety and Tolerability Extension Trial for Patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation
      (CIC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, safety and tolerability extension trial of 10 mg
      elobixibat daily, with possibility for dose adjustment to 5 mg daily, for 52-week Treatment
      Period in patients with CIC. A dose adjustment to 5 mg/day was allowed for the remainder of
      the trial if a patient reported unacceptable treatment-related diarrhoea that occurred within
      the first four weeks of treatment.

      The trial enrolled patients from two lead-in, double-blind efficacy trials (trial codes
      NCT01827592 and NCT01833065).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation - Quality of Life (PAC-QOL): Overall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>PAC-QOL is a 28-item questionnaire for psychometric assessment of disease-specific QOL. The questionnaire is based on a 5-point Likert scale; ranging from 0 [none of the time or not at all] to 4 [all of the time or extremely]). A lower score indicates a better QOL. The PAC-QOL questionnaire is developed specifically for patients with constipation. PAC-QOL has four sub-scales: 'Worries and Concerns', 'Physical Discomfort', 'Psychosocial Discomfort', and 'Dissatisfaction'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Group 5-Dimensions 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardised measure of health status developed to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels (1-5 denotes): no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems, respectively. A unique health state was defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each health state was converted into a single EQ-5D-5L index value. The index values are country specific and values specified for United Kingdom (UK) were used for this study. The index value range for UK lies between -0.594 - 1.000. A positive index value represents better health status while the negative value represents poor health status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Group Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12, 24, 36 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ VAS presents the participant's self-evaluated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. This scale is numbered from 0 to 100, where '100' means best health you can imagine and '0' means worst health you can imagine. The participant simply mark an 'X' on the scale to indicate &quot;how his/her health is TODAY&quot; and mention the same number in a box provided.</description>

        <description>PAC-QOL is a 28-item questionnaire for psychometric assessment of disease-specific QOL. The questionnaire is based on a 5-point Likert scale; ranging from 0 [none of the time or not at all] to 4 [all of the time or extremely]). A lower score indicates a better QOL. The PAC-QOL questionnaire is developed specifically for patients with constipation. PAC-QOL has four sub-scales: ‘Worries and Concerns’, ‘Physical Discomfort’, ‘Psychosocial Discomfort’, and ‘Dissatisfaction’.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Group 5-Dimensions 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Scores</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardised measure of health status developed to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels (1-5 denotes): no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems, respectively. A unique health state was defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each health state was converted into a single EQ-5D-5L index value. The index values are country specific and values specified for United Kingdom (UK) were used for this study. The index value range for UK lies between -0.594 - 1.000. A positive index value represents better health status while the negative value represents poor health status.</description>
