  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative 5-ALA oral
      administration and subsequently intraoperative tumor bed phototherapy with red light laser,
      as an adjuvant therapy on the 3 years rate of local tumor recurrence in patients with desmoid
      tumors. To evaluate the Safety of 5-ALA administration. 5 years local recurrence rate.

    <description>Data from all subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE whenever possible. Adverse events will be summarized by worst NCI CTC grade. Adverse events classified as NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4, study-drug-related events, and serious adverse events will be summarized separately. Laboratory data will be graded according to NCI CTCAE severity grade.</description>
