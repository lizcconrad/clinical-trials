  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal fluid management has been considered as crucial part to determine postoperative
      outcome and organ function. Recently developed, non invasive cardiac output
      measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous cardiac output(CO)
      monitoring just by attaching electrode on chest wall. Moreover, CO and SSV derived from NICOM
      have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a predictor of fluid
      responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal inconclusive
      patients using gray zone approach.

    <textblock>
      Optimal fluid management has been considered as crucial part to determine postoperative
      outcome and organ function. Many reports have focussed on evaluation of fluid responsiveness
      using various parameters such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation
      (SSV) derived from invasive or semi-invasive monitoring. Recently developed, non invasive
      cardiac output measurement(NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR)has enabled continuous
      cardiac output(CO) monitoring just by attaching electrode on thorax. Moreover, CO and SSV
      derived from NICOM have been demonstrated as predictors of fluid responsiveness. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to evaluate stroke volume variation derived from NICOM as a
      predictor of fluid responsiveness in neurosurgical patients. In addition, we plan to reveal
      inconclusive patients using gray zone approach.
