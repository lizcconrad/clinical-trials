    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells
      are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of islet transplantation, combined with
      immunosuppressive medications, specifically using Campath as induction, for treating type 1
      diabetes in individuals experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness and severe hypoglycemic
      episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (T1D) Type 1 diabetes afflicts nearly 2 million people in the United States, most of them
      children or young adults(1). Untreated, it is a fatal disease. Exogenous insulin,
      administered by multiple injections or by a continuous subcutaneous (SC) infusion from a
      wearable pump, allow long term survival in those who develop the disease, and most who are
      treated in this way will have a very good health-related quality of life(2). However, insulin
      therapy does not provide normal glycemic control, and long term survivors commonly develop
      vascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy (the most common cause of adult
      blindness) and diabetic nephropathy (the most common indication for adult kidney
      transplantation)(3). The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) established that
      these microvascular complications of diabetes can be prevented by maintaining near-normal
      glucose control in patients with T1D(4). However, this degree of control is not always
      achievable despite modern insulin analogs and delivery systems(5), and when achieved, it is
      invariably associated with episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia that can be
      life-threatening(6). A small minority of individuals with T1D develop hypoglycemia
      unawareness, a condition that is life-threatening, is associated with severe deterioration in
      quality of life and activity restriction, and is not amenable to medical therapy(6, 7).

      The hope of achieving near-normal glucose control without hypoglycemia in T1D has provided
      the impetus for developing effective strategies for β-cell replacement via pancreas or
      isolated islet transplantation. When successful, pancreas transplantation can normalize blood
      glucose(BG) in diabetic recipients, with associated stabilization and even reversal of
      microvascular complications(8). However, the risks of the procedure (an almost 10% early
      failure rate due to technical complications, anastomotic leak, bleeding, and infection) and
      the need for lifelong immunosuppression have in most centers limited the target population of
      this therapy to diabetics &lt;50 years of age with minimal or no coronary artery disease, and at
      some centers pancreas transplant is offered only with concomitant kidney transplant(9). As a
      result, T1D patients in need of β-cell replacement are often excluded from whole pancreas
      transplantation. Islet transplantation, in contrast, is accomplished by a much simpler
      procedure in which the islets are infused into the portal vein(10). While this procedure is
      not without risk, the procedural morbidity is much less than that of whole pancreas
      transplantation(11).

      On the other hand, whereas about 80% of whole pancreas transplant recipients will be insulin
      independent at one year after their transplant, &lt;10% of 447 islet recipients transplanted
      between 1990 and 1999 achieved one year insulin independence(12). This was attributed to low
      engrafted islet mass combined with high metabolic demand imposed by glucocorticoids used to
      prevent rejection. In the year 2000, the group from Edmonton reported a series of 7
      consecutive islet transplant recipients treated with islets from multiple donors and a
      glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive regimen(13). These islet recipients were insulin free
      at follow-up ranging from 4.5 to 15 months. All of the recipients had experienced severe
      hypoglycemic episodes prior to transplant, and afterwards, none did. The efficacy of the
      Edmonton approach has now been confirmed by several other centers, and represents a major
      breakthrough in the field(14). However, it has also become clear that, in most islet
      recipients, there is loss of graft function over time; in Edmonton, insulin-independence
      rates have declined from 72% at one year to 28% by three years(15). A multicenter trial using
      the Edmonton protocol has both confirmed the results of the initial experience and raised
      questions relating to the expansion of the procedure to multiple centers, the toxicities of
      the immunosuppressive regimen, and the evaluation of the islet product(14).

      In 2006, the NIH initiated several multi-center (Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium)
      clinical trials of islet transplantation with the primary goal of establishing islet
      transplantation as a therapeutic treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes either
      already have had a successful kidney transplant or with severe hypoglycemic events and good
      native renal function. The clinical protocol utilized for these trials improved from the
      Edmonton protocol in that it incorporates (1) T cell depletion anti-thymocyte antibody(16,
      17); (2) peri-transplant anti-inflammatory therapy using Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-a
      blockade(16); (3) aggressive control of glucose homeostasis after transplant with continuing,
      albeit reduced, insulin therapy(18); (4) short-term anticoagulation therapy peri-intraportal
      islet infusion(18, 19).

      Northwestern is one of the clinical centers of the Consortium and has successfully
      transplanted a total of eighteen patients with twenty-six islet preparations using this
      protocol in the past two and half years. The current study protocol modifies the protocol of
      the (CIT) Clinical Islet Transplantation consortium and substituted anti-thymocyte polyclonal
      antibody with alemtuzumab which has been shown to have efficacy in both pre-clinical model as
      well as clinical trials of allogeneic islet transplantation.
