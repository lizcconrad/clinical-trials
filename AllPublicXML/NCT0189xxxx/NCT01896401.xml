  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The InSeal vascular closure device (VCD)is assessed as percutaneous closure of artery access
      sites for quick hemostasis and ambulation in patients who have undergone large bore
      endovascular catheterization procedures.

      The study hypothesis is that the VCD is safe and efficaient in achieving hemostasis in the
      study population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidate for large bore catheterization procedure (such as TAVI, aortic endograft
             repair) using a CE approved 18Fr access sheath.

          -  Subject age is at least 18 years

          -  Patient has signed most recent approved version of the Informed Consent

          -  Existence of an additional arterial access port is required in instances where an
             occluding balloon is planned to be used as a safety precaution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women Of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP)

          -  Legally non-competent patients

          -  Patient participating in another clinical study at the time of the InSeal VCD study

          -  Prior target artery closure with a vascular closure device having intravascular
             component (such as Angio-Seal) 30 days prior to catheterization

          -  Subjects with known coagulopathy, preexisting hematoma, arteriovenous fistula, or
             pseudoaneurysm at the vessel access site prior to artery closure

          -  Patients that do not tolerate aspirin and clopidogrel anticoagulation treatment

          -  Prior vascular surgery or vascular graft in region of access site

          -  Significant calcification, atherosclerotic disease, or stent within 1.5 cm of the
             puncture site that may interfere with the operation of the experimental device
