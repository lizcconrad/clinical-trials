  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A will investigate the
      PK of olaparib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with
      normal renal function; Part B will allow eligible study patients continued access to olaparib
      after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.

      <recruitment_details>First patient enrolled: 20 Nov 2013; last completed Part A: 27 Mar 2015. Patients were enrolled at 13 sites in 5 countries. Part A assessed PK of olaparib in patients with mild/moderate renal impairment vs normal renal function; Part B provided additional safety data. Data are presented for Part A and Part B.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>56 patients were enrolled into the study, of which 12 did not fulfill the eligibility criteria. Consequently, 44 patients were assigned to treatment and received at least one dose of olaparib in Part A. Forty-three of these 44 patients were assigned treatment and received at least one dose of olaparib in Part B.</pre_assignment_details>
