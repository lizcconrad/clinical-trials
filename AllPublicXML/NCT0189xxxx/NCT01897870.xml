      the purpose of this study is to determine the the effect of a home-based medication
      management program on drug-related problems post-discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inaccuracy of medication histories and lack of knowledge on actual medication use results in
      confusion about medication regimens and medication mismanagement before- during - and after
      hospital admission. This phenomenon accounts for many readmissions, longer duration of
      admission and preventable and serious Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) as a result of Drug Related
      Problems (DRPs). Several studies show that discharge medication reconciliation (MR) and
      counseling by a pharmacy employee reduces the amount of discrepancies in the discharge
      prescription lists. Still, no unequivocal effect of MR on the occurrence of DRPs after
      discharge has been shown. This is due to a shift in underlying potential harmful
      discrepancies from mainly patient based (unintended nonadherence) to mainly system based (eg
      dispensing errors) and might be explained by (1) suboptimal transfer of information (2) an
      overload of information during a stressful situation and (3) difficulty to implement changes
      in medication at home. Therefore the reduction of DRPs, improvement of patients' medication
      knowledge and initial adherence can probably most effectively be addressed in a multifaceted
      integrated transmural intervention. Repetition of important information is the key to
      success. Moreover, the first weeks following hospital discharge are most crucial in
      preventing drug-related problems as patients could slip back in old medication schemes, or
      new problems may arise, such as emerging ADEs due to medication changes made during
      hospitalization.

    <description>The total number of assessed and solved ADEs post-discharge will be measured. Assessing and solving ADEs takes place during the pharmacist home visit.
Using START-STOPP criteria on patients medication records, ADEs will also be compared between the intervention and usual care group.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 6 months after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;medication possession ratio&quot; will be calculated retrospectively from pharmacy dispensing data after 6 months to investigate patient's adherence and compared between the intervention and control group.</description>

    <measure>Patient assessment of medication knowledge at time of home visit</measure>
    <time_frame>within 7 days after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>At time of the home visit patients are asked about their knowledge (e.g. indication, dose regime, etc) regarding the medication they are taking. Knowledge is scored and lack of knowledge is solved by teaching the patient.</description>

    <description>A home visit by patients own community pharmacist within seven days after hospital discharge. The community pharmacist will perform a semi-structured interview on (1) use of the prescribed medication, (2) ADEs, (3) adherence issues, by (A) assessing patient's needs and concerns around his pharmacotherapy, (B) identifying and solving obstacles for medicines intake, (C) checking on the need for a compliance aid, (D) collecting spare medication and finally (4) knowledge on medication use, when to take which medicine and why, and medication changes made during the hospitalisation.</description>
