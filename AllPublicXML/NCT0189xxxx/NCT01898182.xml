  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the change in the severity and clinical signs of skin
      photoaging among Filipino patients using Kinerase cream (Kinetin 0.1%). This study will
      recruit 132 subjects from dermatological clinics in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines
      for a period of 3 months (12 weeks). Changes in severity will be documented using physician
      evaluation, self-evaluation, and through VISIA complexion analysis system.

      This study is a single-arm, open-label, split-face trial in subjects with mild to moderate
      photoaged facial skin. The study will enroll around 132 subjects from selected private
      dermatology clinics in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines.

      Patients from selected private dermatology clinics of a tertiary hospital will be screened
      and recruited to participate. They will be provided a written consent form (Appendix I)
      before they will be included in the study.

      Following enrollment, subjects will return for outpatient visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12 for
      assessment.

      The whole study will be conducted from July 2013 to November 2013. The first month would
      involve recruitment of patients. Qualified patients will start the 12-week treatment period
      and will be asked to follow up every 4 weeks. The last two months would be for data analysis,
      interpretation and writing of the scientific report.

    <description>Kinetin (N6-furfuryladenine) is an essential bio growth factor that regulates cell growth and is proven to delay and reverse the signs of aging. Kinerase has been found out to significantly improve the appearance of skin texture, mottled hyperpigmentation and fine wrinkles. It does not cause the cutaneous side effects that result from other commonly used anti-aging products. The Kinerase cream contains: Water, glyceryl stearate, propylene glycol, butylenes glycol, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, isopropyl palmitate, squalene, stearyl alcohol, glycene soja sterols, dimethicone, laureth-23, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, phenoxyethanol, carbomer, ethylhexyglycerin, sodium hydroxide, soluble collagen, kinetin, panthenol, tocopherol, citric acid, sodium citrate, hydrolysed elastin.</description>
