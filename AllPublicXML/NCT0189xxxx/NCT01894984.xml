  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term treatment efficacy, and safety of
      risperidone long-acting injection in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder
      with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and
      hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center
      (conducted in more than one center), prospective (study following participants forward in
      time) and observational study of risperidone long-acting injection in participants with
      schizophrenia. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study
      commences on Day 1) and Treatment (that is, Week 1-24). All the eligible participants (after
      risperidone intolerance test during screening) will be receiving risperidone as intramuscular
      injection (injection of a substance into a muscle) at a dose of, either 25 milligram (mg),
      37.5 mg or 50 mg every two weeks. Efficacy of the participants will be primarily evaluated
      through Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is a clinician-rated scale that reflects social functioning in 4 domains of behavior (socially useful activities including work and study, personal and social relationships, self care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors). The total score ranges from 1 to 100 (score of 71 to 100 will have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision) divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i=absent to vi=very severe) in each of the 4 domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Relapse at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with relapse was assessed wherein relapse was defined as hospitalization due to the aggravation of psychiatric symptoms of disease condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Attaining Remission Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Remission is defined as a clinical status where for each core symptoms (that are, delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, mannerisms and posturing unusual thought content, blunted affect, passive or apathetic social withdrawal and lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation) were assessed at a low-mild symptom intensity level, where such absent, borderline, or mild symptoms do not influence an individual's behavior.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Reasons for Discontinuation From Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
