    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetic comparability of 1x30 mg
      pegvisomant injection administered as a single 1 mL injection versus 2x15 mg/mL pegvisomant
      administered as two separate 1 mL injections and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the
      new 30 mg strength.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;45 kg (99 lbs).

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of
             the study.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half lives preceding the
             first dose of study medication.

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          -  Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential
             who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of nonhormonal
             contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at
             least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. Male subjects who are
             unwilling to use effective contraception (eg, barrier or abstinence) during the study.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal
             supplements and hormonal methods of contraception (including oral and transdermal
             contraceptives, injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants, progesterone
             releasing IUDs, postcoital contraceptive methods) and hormone replacement therapy must
             be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Depo Provera must
             be discontinued at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication. As an
             exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of 1 g/day. Limited use of
             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to pegvisomant or any components of its formulation, and
             the material of the vial, including latex. Subjects who are allergic to latex should
             be excluded.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             Investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
