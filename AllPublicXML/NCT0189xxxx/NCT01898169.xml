  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes
      have gained in popularity over the last several years. The technology used to manufacture
      ENDS has been evolving rapidly with a variety of delivery mechanisms, nicotine content,
      e-liquids and flavorings. Only in the last few years have researchers begun to examine the
      health risks and benefits, nicotine blood levels, patterns of use, likability, and craving
      and withdrawal relief of ENDS. These studies have shown great variability in nicotine
      delivery, effects on heart rate, and relief of craving or withdrawal among various ENDS
      brands among tobacco cigarette smokers.

      This study will test a new generation ENDS, the NJOY King Bold (NJOY, Scottsdale, AZ). It is
      a single use unit that resembles a traditional cigarette and delivers approximately 150
      puffs. The cartridge inside contains 26 milligrams of nicotine.

      Our primary objective is to evaluate the short-term effects of using the NJOY Kings ENDS on
      heart rate, carbon monoxide and blood nicotine levels and well as on craving for cigarettes
      and nicotine withdrawal. Our secondary objective is to evaluate the subject's usage patterns
      for cigarettes and NJOY King ENDS during a one-week period in which they can use each freely.

      The study includes three visits to the clinic spaced approximately one week apart. Subjects
      who pass the screening visit will return to the clinic for Visit 2 in which they will sample
      the NJOY King ENDS for about 20 minutes before taking home enough to last till Visit 3, one
      week later. They will be instructed to use as many or as few as they like during the week.
      Subjects will keep a daily diary of number of tobacco cigarettes smoked and number of
      e-cigarette puffs taken. Subjects will return to the clinic for Visit 3 after 12 hours of
      abstinence from any form of nicotine in order to assure that they have no nicotine left in
      their bloodstream. Eligible subjects will then participate in two series of 10 puffs of NJOY
      Kings spaced one hour apart. During the 2.5 hours of the testing day, the following will be
      measured: 1) heart rate, 2) carbon monoxide, 3)blood will be sampled for nicotine levels, 4)
      craving for cigarettes and nicotine withdrawal symptoms will be assessed.
