  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label continued access protocol of drisapersen for the treatment
      of male subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) having dystrophin mutations
      correctable by drisapersen-induced DMD Exon 51 skipping. The purpose of this continued access
      protocol is to offer pre-approval access to drisapersen for the treatment of subjects with
      DMD who previously participated in eligible drisapersen studies. The protocol will collect
      safety data required to assure subject safety and periodic efficacy data on muscle function.

  <why_stopped>
    Rights for the further development of drisapersen have been transferred to Prosensa. Therefore
    this study has been cancelled before enrollment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior DMD114876 subjects: Subjects who completed both the 24 week double-blind
             treatment and 24 week post-treatment phases in study DMD114876, OR Subjects who
             withdrew from the treatment portion of study DMD114876 due to meeting laboratory
             safety stopping criteria may be eligible to enroll in the extension study if: the
             laboratory parameters that led to stopping have resolved; benefit of further treatment
             with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the individual subject; and following
             consultation with the GSK Medical Lead.

          -  Prior DMD115501 subjects:

          -  Active subjects who entered into open-label extension study DMD115501. Subjects are
             required to be withdrawn from DMD115501 to participate.

          -  Prior DMD114044 Subjects: US citizens who completed study DMD114044 in another country
             and who want to return to the US to participate, upon agreement by a physician
             conducting this protocol, OR Unites States citizens who participated in DMD114044 but
             who had to withdraw from the study due to meeting laboratory safety stopping criteria
             may be eligible to enroll if: the laboratory parameters that led to stopping have
             resolved; benefit of further treatment with drisapersen outweighs the risk to the
             individual subject; and following consultation with the GSK Medical Lead and upon
             agreement of physician conducting this protocol

          -  Prior DMD114349 Subjects: US citizens who participated in and completed study
             DMD114044 in another country and who entered into the ongoing open-label extension
             study DMD114349 in a country outside the US who wish to withdraw from DMD114349 and
             return to the US to participate in this protocol, upon agreement by a physician
             conducting this protocol. Subjects are required to withdraw from DMD114349 to
             participate in this protocol.

          -  Baseline platelets of 150 x 109/Liters (L) or greater and no history of
             thrombocytopenia.

          -  Continued use of glucocorticosteroids for a minimum of 60 days prior to protocol entry
             with a reasonable expectation that the subject will remain on steroids for the
             duration of the protocol. Changes to or cessation of glucocorticosteroids will be at
             the discretion of the physician conducting this protocol in consultation with the
             subject/parent. The GSK Medical Lead must be notified in a timely manner.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures (with the
             exception of those assessments requiring a subject to be ambulant, for those subjects
             who have lost ambulation).

          -  Able to give informed assent and/or consent in writing signed by the subject and/or
             parent(s)/legal guardian (according to local regulations).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject had a serious adverse experience or who met safety stopping criteria that
             remains unresolved from protocol DMD114876, which in the opinion of the physician
             conducting this protocol could have been attributable to study medication, and which
             is ongoing. Once resolved, subject may be eligible to enroll following consultation
             with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Lead.

          -  Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents, or previous treatment
             with investigational drugs, except for drisapersen, within 28 days of the first
             administration of drisapersen.
