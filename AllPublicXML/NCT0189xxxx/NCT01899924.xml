      The main objective of this study is to describe differential cognitive processing of various
      stimuli by a population of control subjects and a population of patients with selective
      cognitive deficits or altered states of consciousness by using dedicated ERP paradigms and
      high-density EEG picked up system.

      In order to test the relevance of theoretical models of cognitive functions, examination of
      patients with cerebral lesions is of great interest. Thus, the goal of this study is to
      assess cognitive processing in patients by a combination of behavioural clinical tests and
      ERP (event related potentials) specific markers. Indeed, ERP technique makes it possible to
      ascertain that a patient or control subject has or has not performed the task we asked him to
      even if the subject performs the task covertly. From these ERPs markers, we can investigate
      their respective cortical generators. By comparing the results obtained in both healthy and
      pathological populations, we will be able to appreciate differential processing of the same
      stimuli by two different populations and try to correlate these differences with specific
      cerebral lesions and with different outcomes.We previously demonstrated the relevance of this
      approach in the field of disorders of consciousness patients and we project to enrich this
      specific approach by the addition of new markers and by its extension to other fields of
      cognitive and behavioural neurology.

      The procedure will be the following. After obtaining written informed consent, patients will
      be examined clinically with dedicated specialized scales (for example the CRS-R for disorders
      of consciousness patients). Then, we will probe event related potentials by stimulating these
      patients with various stimuli embedded in well-designed paradigms while their scalp EEG will
      be recorded. Following different steps of signal processing the mean ERPs according to
      conditions will be extracted and statistical analysis will be performed. At one year from the
      recording, outcome will be collected and correlated with the obtained ERPs.
