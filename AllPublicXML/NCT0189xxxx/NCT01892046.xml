    <textblock>
      Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a chemical in the body that is involve in the promotion of
      cancer. SNX-5422 is an experimental drug that blocks Hsp90.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone proteins stabilize well over 200 different known
      client proteins helping them to fold correctly as they take up their rightful positions in
      the cell. Inhibitors of the chaperone protein Hsp90 are of current interest because of the
      central role of Hsp90 in the maturation and maintenance of numerous proteins that are
      critical for tumor cell viability and growth. SNX-5422 is a pro-drug of SNX-2112, a potent,
      highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90
      (Hsp90). The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SNX-5422 when combined
      with carboplatin plus paclitaxel in selected solid tumors and assess the safety and efficacy
      of SNX-5422 alone dosed at the MTD as maintenance therapy in selected solid tumors treatment.

Dose escalation will be based on safety outcomes defined as 1 or less dose limiting toxicities during the first 28 day cycle at any dose level. During the dose escalation phase, subjects will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel once every 21 days for a total of 4 courses. During the maintenance phase, SNX-5422 at the MTD will be dosed every other day (QOD) for 21 days of a 28 day cycle.</description>
