  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomised active-controlled trial aims to assess whether Cogmed (adaptive)
      working memory training results in improvements in untrained measures of cognition, speech
      perception and self-reported hearing abilities in older adults (50-74 years) with
      mild-moderate hearing loss who are existing hearing aid users, compared with an active
      placebo Cogmed (non-adaptive) control. It is hypothesised that improvements on trained Cogmed
      tasks, representing increased working memory capacity, will result in improved performance on
      cognitive and speech perception tasks that engage working memory. We also measure
      self-reported hearing ability to assess self-perceived benefit of Cogmed training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in ten people aged between 55-74 years have a significant hearing impairment in their
      better hearing ear (as defined by audiometric hearing thresholds). Yet, it is becoming
      increasingly clear that the challenges faced by older listeners cannot be explained by the
      audiogram. The ability for people with hearing loss to use cognition to support context
      allows for compensation of degraded auditory input, which in turn offers promise for new
      cognitive-based rehabilitative interventions. Working memory is known to be highly associated
      with language and recent evidence has shown significant generalisation of on-task learning
      from Cogmed working memory training to improvements in sentence-repetition skills of children
      with severe to profound hearing loss and use cochlear implants. This evidence offers support
      for further investigation into the potential benefits of working memory training to improve
      speech perception abilities in other hearing impaired populations. This study aims to assess
      whether Cogmed (adaptive) working memory training improves the listening abilities of adults
      with mild to moderate hearing loss as assessed using untrained measurers of cognition, speech
      perception and self-reported hearing ability, compared with an active control (Cogmed,
      non-adaptive) group. A 6 month follow-up will assess retention of any training-related
      improvements in outcomes for the adaptive training group.

Task difficulty (number of to-be-remembered items) increases based on individual performance, in order to maintain average daily performance levels of approximately 60% of trials correct. Participants complete 35-45 minutes of active training per day, 5 days a week for 5 weeks.</description>
