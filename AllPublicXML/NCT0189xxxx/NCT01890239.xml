      BACKGROUND Demographic trends coupled with a rise in chronic diseases mean that the
      population of patients requiring palliative and end-of-life care is ageing. Due to the ageing
      population palliative care for older people has been identified as one of the worldwide
      public health priorities. A majority of elderly patients die in hospital. Studies from the
      United Kingdom and other countries have shown that many older persons dying in hospital
      experience suboptimal care. The Care Programme for the Last Days of Life has been developed
      to improve the quality of end-of-life care in acute geriatric hospital wards. The programme
      is based on existing end-of-life care programmes but modeled to the acute geriatric care
      setting. There is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of end-of-life care programmes and
      the effects that may be achieved in patients dying in an acute geriatric hospital setting are
      unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Care Programme for the
      Last Days of Life in improving the quality of care and quality of life during the last 48
      hours of life of patients dying in acute geriatric hospital wards in Flanders as compared to
      usual care.

      METHODS In order to contribute substantially to the increase of evidence for the effect of
      the Care Programme for the Last Days of Life in patients dying in acute geriatric hospital
      wards, a cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Ten hospitals with one or
      more acute geriatric wards will conduct a one-year baseline assessment during which care will
      be provided as usual. For each patient dying in the ward, a questionnaire will be filled in
      by a nurse, a physician and a family carer. At the end of the baseline assessment hospitals
      will be randomized to receive intervention (implementation of the Care Programme) or no
      intervention. Subsequently, the Care Programme will be implemented in the intervention
      hospitals over a six-month period. A one-year post-intervention assessment will be performed
      immediately after the baseline assessment in the control hospitals and after the
      implementation period in the intervention hospitals. Primary outcomes are symptom frequency
      and symptom burden of patients in the last 48 hours of life.

      DISCUSSION This will be the first cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect
      of the Care Programme for the Last Days of Life for the acute geriatric hospital setting. The
      results will enable us to evaluate whether implementation of the Care Programme has positive
      effects on end-of-life care during the last days of life in this patient population and which
      components of the Care Programme contribute to improving the quality of end-of-life care.

    <description>The Care Programme essentially aims to raise awareness among geriatric health care staff of the importance for improving end-of-life care and to prepare them for a change in end-of-life care, to train staff in delivering good end-of-life care with the support of a multi-professional document called the Care Guide for the Last Days of Life, to support dying geriatric patients with the Care Guide for the Last days of Life, to regularly evaluate the delivered end-of-life care and support and to further educate the staff in delivering optimal end-of-life care. The Care Programme consists of the following documents: (1) the Care Guide for the Last Days of Life, (2) supportive documentation and (3) an implementation guide.</description>
