    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ) is composed of 24 yes or no questions designed to assess disability related to back pain.</description>

    <measure>Quality of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The Short form of the McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) consists of 15 representative words from the sensory and affective categories of the standard long form. The 6 point intensity scale and a VAS are included to provide indices of overall pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global perceived effect (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Global perceived effect is an 11 point scale that ranges from 5 (vastly worse) through 0 (no change) to 5 (completely recovered). For all measures of global perceived effect (at baseline and all follow-ups), participants were asked compared to when this episode ﬁrst started, how would you describe your back these days. A higher score indicates higher recovery from the condition.</description>
