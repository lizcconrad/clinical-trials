    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new ceramic metal bone graft substitute for hemi
      craniectomies. The frequency of infections and rupture of skin will be studied, which is a
      reoccurring problem with currently used bone graft substitutes in this subject population. In
      addition, the quality of life before and after implantation will be evaluated as well as the
      bone regeneration around implant.

    <description>The primary endpoint, rate of adverse events, will be measured by clinical evidence of infection and/or manifested rupture of skin around the implant, within 12 months, that necessitates explantation.</description>

    <time_frame>The PET/CT scan will be taken at 12 months post intervention and it will be compared with 2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The bone tracer (18 F fluoride) will be used to measure bone regeneration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Obtained informed consent.

          -  Males or females, ≥18 years of age

          -  Subject with cranial defect size &gt; 25 cm2.

          -  History of previous cranial implant failure and where the latest cranial
             reconstruction failed within 12 months. (This means that the patient demonstrates a
             non-reconstructed cranial defect after removal of implant or exhibit an implant
             failure, e.g. local infection and/or protrusion through the skin.)

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures and restrictions.

          -  The 5 subjects participating in bone regeneration analysis (PET/CT scans) has to be 50
             years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignancy adjacent to the reconstruction area, including brain and calvaria, with
             on-going or planned surgical intervention.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

        Exclusion criteria during surgery, if applicable:

        Perioperative appearance of previously not identified tumor or infection in the
        reconstruction area.
