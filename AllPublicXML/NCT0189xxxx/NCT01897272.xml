  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients who are schedule to have carpal tunnel release surgery.
      The investigators have developed this study in order to determine if post-operative splinting
      is effective in improvement of patient outcomes after this surgical procedure. The study is
      being conducted under the direction of Huey Tien, MD. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if post-operative splinting is effective in improving patient outcomes after having
      short-incision carpal tunnel release. The investigators will randomize each patient into
      group 1, splinting after surgery or group 2 no splinting after surgery. Each group will have
      the same outcome measurements done to determine the best outcome of the two groups.

      Your participation in this study will last for five office visits of approximately 30 minutes
      each. If you decide to participate in this study, we would first have you come to clinic
      where you would undergo some standard measurements. This includes measuring grip and key
      pinch strength and completing a patient questionnaire. During your visits we will scan the
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the pisiform bone level to determine the level of
      CTS with the Ultrasound Biomiscroscopy machine (Vevo 2100). This is a new technique with a
      machine similar to a regular ultrasound machine. The primary difference is that the frequency
      of soundwaves is higher than a standard ultrasound machine. There are no known significant
      risks associated with the use of this machine. At this time the machine is experimental, and
      is not currently approved by the FDA for clinical use. However, this device is not considered
      to pose significant risk. Candidates for this study must have been diagnosed with single
      carpal tunnel syndrome and are going to receive nerve decompression with short incision, over
      the age of 18, and able to give informed consent to participate in a research study.

    <description>This is a high resolution ultrasound used to determine the distance between the surface and the median nerve. This device is a research device not approved for clinical use, but is considered a non-significant risk (NSR) device. This machine is just like a regular ultrasound machine. The primary difference is that the frequence of the soundwaves is higher than a standard ultrasound machine. At this time, the machine is experimental, and it is not currently approved by the FDA for clinical use. However, this same technology is used in similar devices by opthamologists to image retinas. It has been used on hudnreds of humans for research studies.</description>
