  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Losses of muscular fitness/balance are common occurrences with aging that can lead to an
      increased fall-risk. The accelerated bone loss that may accompany menopause makes some women
      even more &quot;at-risk&quot; for serious consequences related to falling. Interventions to reduce
      fall-risk have been conducted in an attempt to improve balance or muscular fitness, but often
      these interventions require monotonous exercises that don't arouse enough long-term interest
      to elicit the improvements. In other words, while the intervention may be beneficial,
      participants quit before they can realize any gains.

      Currently, there is little research that uses novel technology-based programs to promote
      balance exercises among middle-aged women. The Wii Fit system includes various strength and
      balance exercises integrated into games intended to have the participant have fun and retain
      interest, while also improving fitness. By using such a program, women could potentially
      improve their balance and decrease their fall risk in a way that is fun and exciting.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a Wii Fit based exercise program on
      balance/muscular fitness/markers of bone health in women between the ages of 45-60 with low
      bone mass. Volunteers who have moderately low bone levels (n = 28) will be randomly assigned
      to either the Wii Fit exercise intervention or a normally active control. Balance ability,
      muscular fitness, body composition, physical activity levels and markers of bone health will
      be assessed before and after the intervention.

      Each participant in the intervention will be provided a pre-programmed Wii Fit console and
      balance board to use at home. The intervention will consist of a 12-week program that they
      perform 30 minutes a day 3 days a week. The exercises include 10 minutes of Yoga poses and
      strength exercises and then 20 minutes of balance games such as soccer heading, ski slalom
      and table tilt.

      At the 6 week point and the conclusion of the intervention, participants will come to the lab
      for testing on the same tests done initially.

      The overall goal of this study is to gauge the efficacy of this intervention to improve
      balance, fitness, and bone health in at-risk women. This project is important because it
      offers an exciting, fun, and motivating way to impact fall-risk before clinical symptoms
      develop. Overall, this intervention could significantly reduce healthcare dollars spent on
      fall-related outcomes, as well as reduce fall-related mortality.

    <description>Muscular strength and endurance will be assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer. The strength protocol will involve 60 degrees/second, 180 degrees/second, and 240 degrees/second. Muscular endurance will be assessed via 50 repetitions at 240 degrees/second. Testing will occur at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will be assigned a Wii console and a Wii Fit balance board. The intervention group will be asked to play for 30 minutes a day, 3 times per week, using only the participant profile pre-programmed for them. They will complete yoga poses and strength training exercises for the first 10 minutes and balance coordination games for the remaining 20 minutes. They will be asked to complete each exercise at least twice, preferably by cycling through all exercises. Participants will be asked to do all of the exercises in one 30-minute session, rather than breaking them up throughout the day.
All participants will be asked to keep a record of which games they play and for how long. The Wii Fit software also keeps a digital record of which exercises were completed and how long they were performed. At the end of the intervention the investigator will use the information stored in the Wii, as well as activity logs, to assess compliance.</description>
