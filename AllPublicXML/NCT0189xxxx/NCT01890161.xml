  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in human patients with asthma that the sponsor is conducting in order
      to evaluate if there are signals that the investigational medication, AXP1275, may be a safe
      and effective treatment for asthma. The results of this study may help the sponsor to design
      additional studies.

    <textblock>
      This 2-way, randomized, double-blind crossover study in subjects with mild to moderate atopic
      asthma is designed to compare the responses to allergen and methacholine challenges within
      the same subject after approximately 2 weeks of treatment with AXP1275 50 mg or placebo. A
      total of 20 subjects with asthma with a dual (early and late) asthmatic response to an
      inhaled aeroallergen will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (placebo then AXP1275
      or AXP1275 then placebo) in a double-blind fashion to receive either oral AXP1275 or matching
      placebo, once-daily, for 14 days. The washout period between the 2 treatment periods will be
      14 to 21 days.

      A post-treatment follow-up visit will occur 14 ± 3 days after completion of the second
      treatment period.
