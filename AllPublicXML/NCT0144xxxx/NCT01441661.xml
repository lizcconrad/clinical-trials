  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study includes patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who are
      treated with Sunitinib alone or combined with other systemic therapies. The aim of the trial
      is to increase knowledge about usage, dosage, efficacy and safety under conditions of routine
      use of Sunitinib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) exempted manufacturers from conducting
      clinical trials of Sunitinib in China, overall efficacy and safety data of Sunitinib in
      Chinese patients with renal cell carcinoma were deficiency. The investigators carried out
      this research project will be sufficient evidence, and help clinicians in China to make
      decision in real daily practice.
