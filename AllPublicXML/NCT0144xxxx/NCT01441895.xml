    <textblock>
      The study objective is to assess changes in corneal sensation and dry eye signs and symptoms
      following cataract extraction/femtosecond arcuate relaxing incisions.

      Our clinical hypothesis is to determine if a combination of cataract surgery and femtosecond
      arcuate relaxing incisions lead to a reduction in corneal sensation and the onset or
      worsening of dry eye signs and symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18 years or older, in good general health

          -  Prior to signing the Institutional Review Board approved Informed Consent Form /
             Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act subject read and gained an
             understanding of the contents

          -  Subject scheduled for cataract extraction with intraocular lens and requiring two (2)
             femtosecond arcuate relaxing incisions for correction of corneal astigmatism

          -  Subject has greater than or equal to 1.0 D and less than or equal to 2.5 Diopters of
             corneal astigmatism as measured by keratometry or corneal topography

          -  Two (2) arcuate incisions should be 45° in length and 180° apart.

          -  All arcuate relaxing incisions will be placed exactly 4.5 mm from the visual axis for
             a 9 mm optical zone.

          -  Corneal sensation at Screening by Cochet-Bonnet Aesthesiometry with floor stand &gt;50 mm
             in all five regions

          -  Be willing / able to return for all required study visits and comply with instructions
             given by study staff

          -  Potential for best corrected visual acuity post cataract surgery of 20/20

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled inflammation not related to dry eye

          -  Corneal abnormality that can affect corneal sensation or tear film stability (except
             superficial punctate keratitis (SPK)).

          -  History of ophthalmic herpes simplex or zoster keratitis

             corneal incision

          -  Contact lens wear during the study. Soft contact lens wearers should discontinue use
             at least two weeks prior to Screening visit. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) or hard contact
             lens wearers should discontinue use at least one month prior to Screening visit.

             beta-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines,
             estrogen-progesterone, and other estrogen derivatives), unless that medication has
             been used in the same dose for at least 3 months and is expected to remain constant
             for the course of the study
