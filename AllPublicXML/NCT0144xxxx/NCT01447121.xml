    <measure>Number of Self-Test Fingerstick Blood Glucose (BG) Results Within +/- 15mg/dL (&lt;75 mg/dL) or Within +/- 20% (&gt;=75 mg/dL) of Laboratory Glucose Method</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Untrained subjects with diabetes tested self-test fingerstick blood using an investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS), which included an investigational meter and sensor. BGM results were compared with capillary plasm BG results obtained with a reference lab glucose method - Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. BG meter results were used to calculate the number of BG results within +/- 15 mg/dL (for reference BG results &lt;75mg/dL) or +/- 20% (for reference BG results &gt;=75mg/dL) of the reference method results (YSI capillary plasma).</description>
