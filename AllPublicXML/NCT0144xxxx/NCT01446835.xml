      The purpose of this study is to compare the cosmetic appearance of two different contact
      lenses on Asian eyes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to evaluate the cosmetic appearance of two different contact
      lenses worn contralaterally for 20 minutes. No vision or comfort variables will be assessed
      in this cosmetic appearance and lens fit non-dispensing study.

    <measure>Cosmetic Appearance Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>After 20 minutes of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Participant will be asked on a questionnaire, &quot;Which lens do you prefer for looking more natural?&quot; Subject will record on the questionnaire, &quot;Left lens,&quot; &quot;Right lens,&quot; or &quot;No preference.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Centration</measure>
    <time_frame>After insertion and before 20 minutes of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator will assess lens centration using a biomicroscope, which magnifies the appearance of the contact lens on the participant's eye. Lens centration will be graded on a 5-point scale, with 0 being centered and 4 being severe decentration with corneal exposure.</description>
