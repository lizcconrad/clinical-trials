    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies vitamin D levels in the skin of healthy subjects after oral
      supplementation. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The
      use of cholecalciferol, a vitamin D, may keep skin cancer from forming.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if high-dose oral cholecalciferol supplementation increases vitamin D
      receptor (VDR) expression in keratinocytes from photoprotected areas in healthy subjects with
      documented insufficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (defined as =&lt; 30.0 ng/mL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the modulation in CYP24 expression in keratinocytes (from photoprotected and
      photodamaged skin samples).

      II. To assess the modulation in VDR expression in keratinocytes (from photodamaged skin
      samples).

      III. To assess the mechanistic information concerning the action of cholecalciferol
      supplementation in the state of keratinocytic differentiation by assessing caspase 14,
      loricrin, and assessment of stratum corneum thickness.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in
      this patient cohort, including the evaluation of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone
      (PTH).

      V. To assess the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels after intervention supplementation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the corresponding VDR and CYP24 expression in benign melanocytic nevi.
      (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) twice weekly for up to 8-9 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 10-14 days.
