  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent public health problem that results
      from progressive atherosclerosis of arteries in the lower extremities. PAD is also associated
      with major detrimental effects on quality of life and functional status, and is the most
      important cause of limb amputation. More importantly, PAD is a major manifestation of
      cardiovascular disease and a potent predictor of myocardial infarction, stroke and death.
      Despite its frequent occurrence, little is known about the natural history of PAD in
      Hispanics who represent 12.5% of the United States. Because access to health care is limited
      among Hispanics, CBPR is the ideal process to reach this target population. The goal of the
      proposed study is to evaluate community-based strategies of detection and treatment of
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in Hispanics. The proposed project consists of two phases:
      a cross-sectional phase (PAD detection), followed by a randomization phase.During the PAD
      detection study , the prevalence and severity of PAD in this population will be determined.
      Specific risk factors associated with PAD among the Hispanic participants will be identified.
      During the second phase patients will be enrolled in a randomized, non-blinded trial
      comparing a community-based risk factor modification and supervised exercise program versus
      usual care for PAD. These individuals will undergo a baseline evaluation similar to the one
      obtained during the first phase of the study, but will also include functional testing of the
      lower extremities.

    <description>Walking distance (Six-Minute Walk test). Following a standardized protocol, individuals are instructed to walk back and forth a 100-ft hallway as far as they can in six minutes after instructions to cover as much distance as possible. A research assistant walks slightly behind each participant so as not to pace the individual. The research assistant records whether or not each person stops during the 6-minute walk. During the proposed study, members of the research team and trained lay health promoters (LHPs) will walk directly behind the individuals and give standardized instructions of encouragement at set intervals. Data will be reported on meters walked.</description>

Walking duration will begin at 20 - 30 minutes per session for the first month of the program, and increased by 5 minutes per session per month until a total of 45 minutes of walking per session is reached by the third month. During each exercise session, individuals will be encouraged to walk at a speed of approximately 2 mph until they achieve leg pain or discomfort on walking of moderate severity.Individuals are then allowed to have a brief period of standing or sitting rest to permit symptoms to resolve before they resume exercise.</description>

        <title>Effect of an Exercise Intervention on Walking Ability (Functional Outcome)</title>
        <description>Walking distance (Six-Minute Walk test). Following a standardized protocol, individuals are instructed to walk back and forth a 100-ft hallway as far as they can in six minutes after instructions to cover as much distance as possible. A research assistant walks slightly behind each participant so as not to pace the individual. The research assistant records whether or not each person stops during the 6-minute walk. During the proposed study, members of the research team and trained lay health promoters (LHPs) will walk directly behind the individuals and give standardized instructions of encouragement at set intervals. Data will be reported on meters walked.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was limited by the lack of patients compliance to follow the schedule for the exercise sessions. Patients did not assisted regularly to the walking sessions, and the schedule was completed in 70 % of the plan.</limitations_and_caveats>
