  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment in patients with
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS).

      The goal of the study is to evaluate CPAP treatment duration recorded by the AL539 during
      attended in-hospital polysomnography in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are patients with sleep apnea predominantly obstructive, with CPAP for at least 2
      months, and requiring in-hospital night polygraphic record control.

      The medical device was developed to determine:

        -  the duration of use of CPAP by the patient,

        -  the persistence of any respiratory abnormalities during treatment.

      These two parameters are used to ensure that treatment is done correctly.

      The use of the AL539 is expected to improve the home-monitoring of ventilation with CPAP.
