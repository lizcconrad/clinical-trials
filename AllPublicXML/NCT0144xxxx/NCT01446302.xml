    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize the hormonal and inflammatory responses to
      hemodialysis, and to determine the effect of a meal versus fast on the metabolic changes in
      the post-dialytic phase.

      Studies show that hemodialysis (HD) is a protein catabolic event per se and probably
      contributes to the high prevalence of protein-energy wasting among HD patients. The muscle
      catabolic effect of HD is probably caused by loss of amino acids (10-12 grams per dialysis
      session) and by exacerbation of the inflammatory and hormonal disorders already present.
      Activation of the immune system during HD has been linked to the contact of blood cells with
      the dialyzer membrane and to bacterial-derived DNA fragments in the dialysis fluid. An
      intradialytic increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to correlate with muscle
      protein catabolism, and because IL-6 continues to increase for 2 hours after HD has ended,
      there might be a considerable &quot;carry-over effect&quot; to the post-dialytic period. Moreover, HD
      induces significant changes in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling
      pathways. Plasma insulin is cleared by HD, and the bioactivity of IGF-I is reduced by 50%
      during a 4-hr maintenance HD due to an up-regulation of IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), the
      only acutely regulated IGFBP.
