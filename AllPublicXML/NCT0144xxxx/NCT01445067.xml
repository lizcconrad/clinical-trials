        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with migraine with or without aura who are otherwise healthy as determined by
             medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory evaluations and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), will be eligible

          -  Men or women [women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or Women of non childbearing
             potential (WONCBP)] ages 18-55 years inclusive, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0
             to 32.0 kg/m2 with not more than 8 migraines a month

          -  Patient has at least 1 year history of migraines (with or without aura) including the
             following:

               1. Meet the diagnostic criteria for migraine with history of at least 1 year (with
                  or without aura) at the screening visit

               2. Migraine attacks with the age of onset prior to 55 years old

               3. Migraine attacks, on average, lasts about 4-72 hours if untreated in the 3 months
                  prior to screening visit

          -  2-8 moderate or severe migraine attacks per month in the 3 months prior to screening
             visit. The migraine, for which the patient receives treatment during the study, must
             have at least one of the associated symptoms: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, or
             migraine with aura

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patient is pregnant/breast-feeding (or is a female expecting to conceive during
             study period)

          -  Patient has history or evidence of stroke/transient ischemic attacks, heart disease,
             coronary artery vasospasm, other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases,
             uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled diabetes, or Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

          -  Patient will be excluded if they take medications for acute migraine more than 10 days
             per month, had very frequent chronic tension type headaches for 15 or more days per
             month (or were unable to distinguish between tension-type headaches and migraine)

          -  Patient has major depression, other pain syndromes that might interfere with study
             assessments, psychiatric conditions, dementia, or significant neurological disorders
             (other than migraine)

          -  Patient has a history of gastric, or small intestinal surgery, or has a disease that
             causes mal absorption

          -  Patient has a history or current evidence of any unstable medical conditions (eg,
             history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known suspected infection,
             hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion, would expose them to
             undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with assessments of safety
             or efficacy during the course of the trial

          -  Patient has basilar migraine and hemiplegic migraine

          -  Patient taking narcotic medication

          -  History of alcohol, substance or drug abuse within the last year

          -  Uses an opiate as first line acute treatment for migraine attacks

          -  History of ergotamine, any acute therapy or triptan intake on greater than/equal 10
             days per month on a regular basis for greater than/equal 3 months

          -  History of simple analgesic intake on greater than/equal 10 days per month for greater
             than/equal 3 months

          -  History of use of opioid or combination medication intake or butalbital containing
             analgesic greater than 5 days per month for greater than/equal to 3 months

          -  Do not receive migraine relief from a triptan migraine treatment

          -  Evidence of renal impairment - calculated creatinine clearance &lt;60ml/min or clinically
             relevant finding on urinalysis
