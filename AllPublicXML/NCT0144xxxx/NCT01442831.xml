  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the single dose pharmacokinetics of total
      radioactivity in plasma and whole blood following PO administration of [14C] TR-701 in
      healthy adult male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, single-dose study of the absorption, metabolism, and
      excretion of 200 mg [14C]-TR-701 (approximately 100 μCi) administered orally following at
      least an 8-hour fast. Subjects will receive a single dose of 200 mg [14C] TR 701
      (approximately 100 μCi) administered as an oral solution.

      The dose will be administered following at least an 8-hour fast and followed by a 4-hour fast
      from food, not including water.
