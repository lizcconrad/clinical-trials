    <textblock>
      Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders
      characterised by orbital inflammation without any identifiable local or systemic causes. It
      is a rare clinical entity and a diagnosis of exclusion. Lymphomas, thyroid eye diseases or
      systemic diseases can have similar presentation and so, a histopathological diagnosis is
      considered important. IOIS is a difficult condition to treat. Compilation of reported small
      series of patients with IOIS suggested that they require multiple systemic immunosuppressant
      drugs and radiotherapy. Recently, a large monocentric study including patients with biopsy
      proven IOIS showed that up to 40% of them can relapse. Their clinical and pathological
      features did not correlate with treatments outcomes. The investigators decide therefore to
      conduct a multicentric retro/ prospective study to determine clinical features,
      histopathology and treatment outcomes of French patients with IOIS.

    <measure>Percentage of remission, relapse or resistance among patients with IOIS during the 24 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>The remission, relapse, or the resistance at inclusion (for those previously diagnosed as IOIS), and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Remission: absence of steroids, their withdrawal or their pursuit at a dose ≤ 10 mg/d in the absence of immunosuppressor treatment.
Relapse: re initiation of steroids, or their ascension in patients for whom they have been reduced to less than 20 mg/d.
Resistance: inability to reduce steroids at an effective dose ≤ 20 mg/d.</description>

      Blood samples will be frozen to form a serum storage and a DNAthèque. These samples will
      achieve further analysis based on the evolution of knowledge on mechanisms contributing to
      the orbital inflammation.
