  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colostrum, mothers' early breastmilk, contains multiple factors that provide immune
      protection to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, a population at high risk for
      hospital-acquired infections. However, critical illness during the first few days of life
      often prevents the initiation of enteral feeds, placing these infants at even higher risk for
      morbidities including feeding intolerance and infection. Oropharyngeal administration has
      been proposed as an alternative route of delivery for colostrum and the immune benefits it
      provides. Research from animal and adult human models supports oropharyngeal administration
      as a potentially safe and effective mode of delivery for immune therapies. Immune components
      of colostrum, such as secretory IgA, may have both direct and indirect effects on the immune
      system. The purpose of this proposed randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study is to
      determine the effect of oropharyngeally administered colostrum (OAC) on immune stimulation in
      VLBW infants, as measured by secretory IgA (sIgA) levels. In addition to measuring sIgA
      response to OAC the investigators will also collect clinical data to determine if OAC has
      effects on tolerance of enteral feedings and rates of infection. The investigators
      hypothesize OAC will have a moderate effect on salivary secretory IgA concentration in VLBW
      infants. If proven efficacious, utilization of OAC in VLBW infants could have far reaching
      consequences for these highly fragile babies including lower rates of infection, improved
      tolerance of enteral feedings, and shorter NICU stays.
