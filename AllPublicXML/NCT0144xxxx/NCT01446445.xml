  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to optimize intravenous ganciclovir(GCV) and oral
      valganciclovir (VGCV)doses, advised by the drug exposure, indicated by the area under the
      concentration time curve (AUC), in renal transplant patients receiving oral VGCV or
      intravenous GCV for CMV prophylaxis or treatment. The initial doses will be calculated
      according to population pharmacokinetic model. Subsequent doses will be adjusted according to
      plasma GCV concentrations, using the Bayesian approach. This method of dose adjustments could
      lead to increase the percentage of patients achieving a therapeutic exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The area under the concentration time curve of serum concentrations of GCV is an indicator of
      systemic exposure to the drug and is related to the effectiveness and safety. According to
      the population model developed by our group, less than 16% of patients treated achieve the
      therapeutic goal of AUC (40 to 50 mcg â€¢ h / L) after drug dosing according to summary of
      product characteristics (SPC). Especially, patients with impaired renal function values
      (creatinine clearance (CrC)l &lt;30 ml / min) or high (CrCl&gt; 70 ml / min) would be overdosed and
      underdosed, respectively, with the risk of more adverse effects or therapeutic failure.

      Therefore, the individualization of the dosage of GCV, can contribute greatly to achieve
      optimal exposure to the drug in transplant patients, especially in the cases of extreme
      values of renal function (CrCl decreased and high). As a consequence, minimize adverse
      effects, ensure greater efficiency in the target population and reduce associated costs.
