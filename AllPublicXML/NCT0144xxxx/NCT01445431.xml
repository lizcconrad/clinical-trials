      Among adult patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis, what is the
      efficacy and safety of virgin coconut oil compared to mineral oil as a therapeutic
      moisturizer for uremic xerosis?

      Objectives of the Study: The general objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of virgin coconut oil (VCO) compared to mineral oil as a therapeutic moisturizer for
      uremic xerosis. The specific objectives are as follows: 1) to determine and compare changes
      in the over-all dry skin score within and between treatment groups at baseline, 2 weeks-post
      and 4-weeks post application; 2) to quantitatively measure the following skin parameters at
      baseline, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post application (skin hydration using a corneometer, skin
      lipids using a sebumeter); 3) to determine and compare changes in quality of life scores
      within and between treatment groups at baseline, and 4-weeks post application; and 4) to
      identify the adverse effects of virgin coconut oil and mineral oil when used as moisturizer
      for uremic xerosis
