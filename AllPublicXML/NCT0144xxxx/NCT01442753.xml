  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-based tobacco use
      prevention intervention directed at immigrant Latino parents of middle school aged youth as
      delivered in partnership with seven community organizations. The primary outcomes of the
      study are youth susceptibility to tobacco use, and changes in parenting practices among the
      parents of the youth. The planning, initiation, and delivery of the intervention will occur
      in collaboration with community organizations that have identified this project as important
      to the families they serve. Though the collaboratively designed training curriculum has been
      successfully tested and a study design for the current project established, a substantive
      development period for this project will allow the research team and collaborating
      organizations to consider key aspects of design and delivery.

      This study design is a randomized (at the level of the family) controlled trial (RCT), with a
      delayed treatment condition for the control group. Participants will be enrolled from
      community agencies known and trusted within the Latino community including two clinics, a
      school, three social service agencies and a University of Minnesota Extension site that are
      likely end-users of the intervention programming.

    <description>Youth tobacco use intentions, Questions are 1) &quot;Do you think you will try a cigarette soon?' (not asked of puffers), 2) &quot;Do you think you will be smoking cigarettes one year from now?&quot;, and 3) &quot;If one of your best friends were to offer you a cigarette, would you smoke it?&quot; A never-smoker will be considered non-susceptible if answer to the first question is 'No' and answers to both questions 2 and 3 are 'Definitely not'; a puffer will be considered non-susceptible if answers to questions 2 and 3 are 'Definitely not'.</description>

    <description>Parenting behaviors - Monitoring knowledge: child disclosure, parental solicitation and control. Personal involvement: measures parent behavior indicative of their efforts to be aware of adolescents' activities and experiences. Consistent discipline: scale based on work conducted at the ASU Prevention Research Center.

Social Support: The MSPSS101 measures perceived support from 3 domains: family, friends, and significant other.</description>
