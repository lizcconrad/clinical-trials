      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the Mobile Geriatrics on the
      management of complex situations in retirement homes and in ambulatory care of frail elderly
      patients, reported by the generalist doctor, in terms of improving the conditions of use
      technical support hospital follow-up recommendations given by the mobile team and their
      impact on outcomes of care.
