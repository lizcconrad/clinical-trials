  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, prospective randomized controlled study with the primary objective to
      evaluate and compare medical treatment of SHPT, namely oral cinacalcet versus surgical
      treatment, that is, parathyroidectomy with forearm autografting, on the progression of
      coronary artery and valvular calcification in endstage renal disease patients over 12 months.
      The change in arterial stiffening and bone mineral density as well as nutritional status will
      be evaluated as secondary objectives of this study.

    <textblock>
      Patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) are frequently complicated with
      vascular calcification. There is some suggestion that subtotal parathyroidectomy may reduce
      or stabilize vascular calcium scores in dialysis patients. Experimental data suggests that
      SHPT plays an important role in mediating uraemic arterial disease and that parathyroidectomy
      largely prevented the development of calcification. Cinacalcet has emerged as a novel therapy
      for the treatment of SHPT and has been shown to reduce the need for surgical
      parathyroidectomy. However, their effects on vascular and bone status have not been
      evaluatedand compared with parathyroidectomy.
