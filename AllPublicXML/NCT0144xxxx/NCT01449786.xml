  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 70% of birch pollen allergic patients suffer from allergic reactions to certain
      foods, e.g. stone fruits, hazelnut and some vegetables. However, specific immunotherapy (SIT)
      with birch pollen extract is not effective for the treatment of associated food allergy in a
      substantial number of patients. Based on our previous clinical and immunological
      investigations of birch pollen related food allergy (BPRFA) the investigators hypothesize
      that for effective SIT of this abundant food allergy the disease-eliciting food allergens
      should be employed. To prove this concept, the investigators aim to sublingually administer
      the major apple allergen, Mal d 1, to birch pollen-allergic patients with concomitant apple
      allergy and evaluate clinical and immunological effects of this treatment. The investigators
      choose Mal d 1 as model food allergen because (i) its cross-reactivity with Bet v 1 has been
      well characterized,(ii) apple is the most frequent trigger for BPRFA and (iii)
      recombinant(r)Mal d 1 was well tolerated after sublingual administration to 20 birch
      pollen-allergic patients in a previous study. Sublingual administration of a defined
      concentration of GMP-rMal d 1 will be compared with equal doses of GMP-rBet v 1 as a positive
      control and placebo-treatment. Clinical parameters will include skin prick tests (SPT) and
      objective and subjective assessment of apple and birch pollen-induced allergic symptoms.
      Immunological parameters will comprise the analysis of antibody and T cell responses to Mal d
      1 and Bet v 1 as well as the evaluation of basophil activation.

      The proposed pilot study will be a first investigation of the concept to specifically treat
      BPRFA with the involved food allergens and thus, represents an important step in the
      development of an efficient and safe therapy in the future.
