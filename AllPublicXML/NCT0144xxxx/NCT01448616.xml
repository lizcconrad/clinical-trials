  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to
      evaluate the effect of oral and topical (vaginal gel) tenofovir on genital herpes simplex
      virus (HSV) shedding among herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) seropositive, human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seronegative women. The investigators hypothesize that tenofovir
      will reduce genital HSV shedding compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of
      55 adult, healthy women who are HSV-2 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative. Women will first
      participate in a run-in phase with twice daily swabbing. Following 4 weeks of swabbing,
      participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to one of three groups: 1) oral tenofovir and placebo
      gel, 2) oral placebo and tenofovir gel, or 3) oral placebo and placebo gel. Participants will
      begin treatment and swab the genital region twice daily for 5 more weeks. Study drug will be
      administered daily.

    <description>The within-person changes in rate of HSV shedding during study drug administration (treatment phase) compared with the rate of HSV shedding during lead-in observation phase in the same participants. We evaluated only weeks 2-5 of HSV shedding during the treatment phase in comparison with the 4 weeks of the lead-in phase. We excluded the first week of samples from the treatment phase in order to allow for physiologic run-in of the treatment. This is analyzed separately for each treatment arm and not compared between arms.</description>

    <description>The within-person changes in mean log-copy numbers of HSV shed during treatment phase (oral TDF, vaginal TFV, or double placebo) compared with the lead-in (observation) phase in the same participants. Each treatment arm is analyzed separately without comparison between arms.
We evaluated only weeks 2-5 of HSV shedding during the treatment phase in comparison with the 4 weeks of the lead-in phase. We excluded the first week of samples from the treatment phase in order to allow for physiologic run-in of the treatment.</description>

    <description>The within person change in proportion of days with lesions between the lead-in (observational) and study drug (treatment) phase for each arm separately. No between arm comparisons were performed. We include intent to treat with all randomized participants as well as per protocol (persons receiving study drug for at least 30 days with 90% or better reported compliance per returned product counts).
We evaluated only weeks 2-5 of HSV shedding during the treatment phase in comparison with the 4 weeks of the lead-in phase. We excluded the first week of samples from the treatment phase in order to allow for physiologic run-in of the treatment.</description>

        <title>HSV Shedding Rate in Those Receiving Oral TDF, Vaginal TFV, or Double Placebo</title>
        <description>The within-person changes in rate of HSV shedding during study drug administration (treatment phase) compared with the rate of HSV shedding during lead-in observation phase in the same participants. We evaluated only weeks 2-5 of HSV shedding during the treatment phase in comparison with the 4 weeks of the lead-in phase. We excluded the first week of samples from the treatment phase in order to allow for physiologic run-in of the treatment. This is analyzed separately for each treatment arm and not compared between arms.</description>

            <description>tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF): Oral tenofovir will be administered as tablets. TDF (Viread®) tablets contain 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil. Study participants are instructed to take the one tablet, by mouth, once each day without regard to meals.
placebo gel: Study participants are instructed to insert one dose (the entire contents of one applicator) of product into the vagina once each day. They are instructed to insert their gel as close to the same time each day as possible.
The placebo gel (known as the 'universal' placebo gel) is formulated to minimize any possible effects — negative or positive — on study endpoints.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was not powered to detect differences in lesion rate; the study was appropriately powered to detect a 50% decrease in viral shedding only, and therefore may have been underpowered to detect significant findings for secondary outcomes.</limitations_and_caveats>
