  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of reducing the rate of glucose
      absorption on oxidative stress after eating and to compare it with the effects of vitamin C.
      The hypothesis is that reducing the rate of glucose absorption will reduce oxidative stress
      to a similar extent as 1g vitamin C.

    <textblock>
      Recently, much attention has been paid to evidence that abnormalities of the postprandial
      state (hyperglycemia) are important contributing factors to the development of chronic
      disease. This attention has increased interest in the role low glycemic index (GI) foods
      could potentially play in preventing postprandial oxidative burst/stress. GI is a means by
      which to categorize carbohydrate according to their postprandial glycemic response. Low GI
      foods promote slow intestinal absorption, prolonged and less pronounced postprandial
      glycemia, may decrease risk of chronic disease, as well as provide metabolic benefit to
      people living with glucose abnormalities as well as those with normal glucose. Few studies
      have been conducted looking at the potential relationship between GI and oxidation and are
      limited by dietary/lifestyle confounders. The proposed study has been developed to eliminate
      these confounders. Hypotheses (3): 1. Sipping glucose slowly over 3h will result in less
      oxidative stress than ingesting the same amount of glucose as a bolus over 5min. 2. Sipping
      glucose will reduce oxidative stress to the same extent as 1g of oral vitamin C. 3. The
      effect of sipping glucose on oxidative stress will occur sooner than that of vitamin C.
