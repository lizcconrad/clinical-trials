  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is drug that is normally used to treat people with diabetes. New research has
      discovered that metformin may also kill cancer stem cells. These cancer stem cells make up
      only a small portion of a cancer, but may be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy or
      for causing recurrence of the cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of
      metformin on colorectal cancer tumors. The study is designed to develop the methods to test
      tumors for cancer stem cells and then to determine the difference between treating with
      metformin and not treating with metformin with regard to the cancer stem cells. This research
      is investigational because the effect of metformin on cancer stem cells is not known in
      humans. Also, in patients who are not diabetic, metformin would normally not be given prior
      to surgery.

    <description>Subjects in this arm are randomized to receive metformin during the period of time between planning the surgery or biopsy and the actual procedure. After approximately 1 week of taking metformin, we will re-check the blood glucose. We will draw blood for cancer stem cells (about 2 teaspoons) and ask about symptoms. Subjects will stop taking metformin 2 days before the procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented colorectal cancer

          -  Intent to undergo disease resection or biopsy at least 7days from the treatment start
             date (allowing for a minimum of 5 days of treatment plus 2 days break)

          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine levels &lt;1.5 mg/dL [males], &lt;1.4 mg/dL
             [females] or estimated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min)

          -  Adequate hepatic parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤

          -  Intent to perform surgery or biopsy within 7 days of study treatment start;

          -  Any situation where participation in this trial would alter, or cause significant risk
             of altering the ability or timing of a subject to undergo resection of their tumor
