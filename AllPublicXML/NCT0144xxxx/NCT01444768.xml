      This study will evaluate various performance metrics of emergency department operations after
      the implementation of computerized physician order entry in an academic emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective before-after study comparing various operational and
      performance metrics before and after the implementation of a computerized physician order
      entry system in the emergency department.

      The investigators will collect 6 month before, 6 month after of data along with a 2-4 week
      washout period. The investigators will also administer a computerized physician order entry
      survey after the study is completed. This confidential survey will be emailed to all ED
      nurses, residents, and attendings using RedCap. Consent will be implied if they choose to
      participate.
