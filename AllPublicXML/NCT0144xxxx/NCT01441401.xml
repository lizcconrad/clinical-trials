      This investigation aims to understand the following issues in pediatric patients, as well as
      to assess the need of a special investigation and a post-marketing clinical study:

        -  The frequency of treatment related adverse events.

        -  The frequency of efficacy assessment.

        -  Treatment related unlisted adverse events in Japanese Package Insert.

        -  Risk factors likely to affect the frequency of treatment related adverse event.

      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes the first gabapentin should be registered
      consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to extract patients
      enrolled into the investigation at random.

    <description>Clinical efficacy rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved clinical efficacy over the total number of efficacy analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI. For the basis of efficacy evaluation, frequencies of epileptic seizure were recorded during the previous 4 weeks from the treatment start date, and that from the end date of assessment period. Clinical efficacy was assessed according to the following categories: (1) effective, (2) not effective, or (3) not assessable.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Risk Factors for Treatment-Related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>MAX 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to gabapentin in a participant who received gabapentin. Participants with treatment-related adverse events were counted by each candidate risk factor (including gender, age, and disease eligible for the survey) to assess whether these were risk factors for the treatment-related adverse events. No inferential analyses of risk factors were performed because of a small number of the events (5 events).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Key Treatment-Related Adverse Events (Central Nervous System Depressant Actions)</measure>
    <time_frame>MAX 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Central nervous system depressant actions including somnolence and ataxia were determined as key survey items by the sponsor (Pfizer Japan Inc.). These events were defined according to MedDRA/J version 17.1 as the events classified in &quot;psychiatric disorders&quot; or &quot;nervous system disorders&quot; of the system organ classes, or those classified in &quot;asthenia&quot; or &quot;gait disturbance&quot; of the preferred terms. A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to gabapentin in a participant who received gabapentin. Relatedness to gabapentin was assessed by the investigator and sponsor.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Key Treatment-Related Adverse Events (Aggressive Behaviors)</measure>
    <time_frame>MAX 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Aggressive behaviors including affect lability and hostility were determined as key survey items by the sponsor (Pfizer Japan Inc.). These events were defined as the 101 preferred terms listed by pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency and classified according to MedDRA/J version 17.1. A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to gabapentin in a participant who received gabapentin.

    <description>R Ratio was calculated by the following formula, where B represented the baseline frequency of epileptic seizures during the previous 4 weeks from the treatment start date, whereas T represented the frequency of epileptic seizures during the previous 4 weeks from the end of assessment period: R Ratio = (T - B) / (T + B). R Ratio is within the range of -1 to +1, and a negative value represents a reduction in the frequency of seizure.</description>

    <description>Responder rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants whose R ratio was - 0.333 or less, was presented along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI. R ratio of - 0.333 or less corresponded to the decrease of epileptic seizure frequency by 50% or more.</description>

    <description>According to Japanese Package Insert: For infants and children aged 3 to 12 years, a daily dosage of 10 mg/kg of gabapentin should be administered orally in 3 divided doses on the first day of treatment, and an effective dosage of 20 mg/kg should be administered to them in 3 divided doses on day 2. From day 3 on, infants aged 3 to 4 years should be maintained on the dosage of 40 mg/kg, and children aged 5 to 12 years on the dosage of 25 to 35 mg/kg administered orally in 3 divided doses, respectively (the maximum daily dosage: 1800 mg). Though the maintenance dosage may be adjusted depending on the patient's condition, the maximum daily dosage should be 50 mg/kg. At any time point, dosage should not exceed that the dosage for adults and children aged 13 years.As for children aged 13 years or over is as same as administration for adult.</description>
