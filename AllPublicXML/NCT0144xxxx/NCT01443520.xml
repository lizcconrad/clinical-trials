  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol is an opioid analgesic, which is widely used in the treatment of acute and
      neuropathic pain. After oral administration, tramadol is rapidly and almost completely
      absorbed. Tramadol is extensively metabolised by O- and N-demethylation, which are catalysed
      by the liver CYP-450 enzymes. O-desmethyltramadol is an active metabolite and its formation
      is catalysed by CYP2D6. This study is aimed to investigate the possible interaction of oral
      tramadol with duloxetine and venlafaxine. Duloxetine is known to inhibit CYP2D6. Twelve
      healthy male or female adult non-smoking volunteers aged 18-40 years with body weights within
      ±15% of the ideal weight for height are taken into the study. Primary endpoints of the study
      are plasma concentrations of tramadol and its metabolites.

    <description>The analgesic effect of tramadol will be evaluated using the cold pressor test. Briefly, the subject's hand is immersed into ice-cold water of + 4° C up to the wrist. The subject is told to keep his or her hand in the water and to report when the cold sensation becomes painful. Cold pain threshold is defined as the latency from the immersion of the hand to the subject's first report of pain. Cold pain intensity is assessed at 30 s intervals following immersion of the hand in cold water for up to 60s . A verbal numerical rating scale of 0-100 will be used.</description>
