      The effect of mean arterial pressure (MAP) titration to higher level on microcirculation in
      septic shock patients with previous hypertension remains unknown. Our goal was to assess the
      effect of MAP titration to patients' usual level on microcirculation in septic shock patients
      with previous hypertension. We hypothesized that the increase in MAP from 65 mmHg to
      patients' usual level improved sublingual microcirculation.

    <description>As chronic hypertensive patients were supposed to have undergone more blood pressure measurements in daily life than non-hypertensive ones, the averaged MAP acquired from patients' physical examination records of the last two years was registered and assumed as patients' usual level of MAP and target MAP. If patients' medical records were incomplete, a detailed enquiry about the target MAP to their next kin was performed.
After stabilization for 30 min, basal measurements including hemodynamic and microcirculatory measurements were taken, 20 min apart, the NE doses were increased to titrate MAP to the target level. Patients were allowed to stabilize for 30 min before taking new measurements.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Firstly, cardiac output was monitored by NICOM system to minimize the invasive operation.
Secondly, the number of patients enrolled in the study was relatively small. Next, immediate changes of the increase in MAP were investigated.</limitations_and_caveats>
