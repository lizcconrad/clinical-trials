    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of DPK-060 2% ear
      drops compared to placebo for DPK-060 ear drops in patients with acute external otitis. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical cure and microbiological growth following
      treatment with DPK-060 2% ear drops compared to placebo for DPK-060 ear drops.

    <time_frame>AEs occurring during the treatment period were collected on day 8 or 11, as applicable. Four weeks after the last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP), previously reported AEs were followed up and assessed as &quot;recovered&quot; or &quot;not recovered&quot;.</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were collected by a non-leading question such as &quot;have you experienced any new health problems or worsening of existing conditions&quot; as well as reporting events directly observed or spontaneously volunteered by patients. All AEs including but not limited to events reported by the patient, or reported in answer to an open question by the Investigator or member of the study team were recorded as an AE including the following information: Diagnosis; Start date (and time, if relevant), Stop date (and time, if relevant) or resolution; Severity; Action taken; Causality; Seriousness; Outcome.</description>

          <description>AEs were collected by a non-leading question such as &quot;have you experienced any new health problems or worsening of existing conditions&quot; as well as reporting events directly observed or spontaneously volunteered by patients. All AEs including but not limited to events reported by the patient, or reported in answer to an open question by the Investigator or member of the study team were recorded as an AE including the following information: Diagnosis; Start date (and time, if relevant), Stop date (and time, if relevant) or resolution; Severity; Action taken; Causality; Seriousness; Outcome.</description>
          <population>All safety analyses were performed on safety analysis set. All randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of the IMP and had at least 1 safety follow-up performed were included in the safety analysis set.</population>
