  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Bevacizumab inhibits blood vessel growth in cancer cells by blocking a growth factor
           called VEGF. Dasatinib inhibits the action of proteins called tyrosine kinases, which
           promote and stimulate blood vessel formation and cancer growth and spread.

        -  Using the two drugs in combination may provide a more effective cancer treatment than
           either drug used alone.

        -  Both drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for different cancer
           types, but their use in combination sis experimental.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the highest doses of the combination of dasatinib and bevacizumab that can be
      safely given to patients with different cancers and to find out what effects, good and bad,
      these drugs may have on the patient and the disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Adult patients with an advanced solid tumor cancer that cannot be treated successfully with
      standard therapies.

      Design:

        -  Patients in Group 1 receive dasatinib and bevacizumab together throughout the study. The
           dose is increased in successive groups of three to six patients until the optimum safe
           dose is determined. Patients take dasatinib by mouth once a day and receive bevacizumab
           as an infusion through a vein once every 2 weeks in 28-day treatment cycles.

        -  Patients in Group 2 are randomly assigned to receive either dasatinib or bevacizumab for
           cycle one, and then both drugs for all subsequent cycles. The drug doses are based on
           the optimum doses found in Group 1 patients.

        -  Patients have a physical examination and blood and urine tests every 2 weeks for cycles
           1 and 2, and then every 4 weeks for the duration of treatment.

        -  Patients have CT or MRI scans or another imaging test such as ultrasound every 8 weeks
           to monitor the cancer s response to treatment.

        -  Tumor biopsies are obtained from patients in Group 2 before treatment, 2 weeks into the
           first treatment cycle, and 2 weeks into the second cycle.

        -  Dynamic, contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) tests are done on patients in Group 2 before
           treatment, 2 weeks into the first cycle and 4 weeks into the second cycle. This MRI test
           uses a special non-radioactive dye that shows blood flow in a certain part of the body.

        -  For patients who have been on the study over 2 years, the cycle may be lengthened to 6
           or 8 weeks at the discretion of the investigator.

      BACKGROUND:

      Dasatinib is an inhibitor of SRC family kinases, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, EPHA2 and PDGF beta
      receptor.

      Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all biologically active
      isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, or VEGF-A) with high affinity
      (k(d) equal to 1.1nM).

      This Phase I trial is open to patients with all solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of dasatinib and bevacizumab.

      Determine biochemical changes in the src-FAK and src-PLC-. and VEGF signal transduction
      pathways in tumor and stromal cells in response to treatment at the MTD, in a pilot fashion,
      if those changes are statistically significant.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Adults with histologically documented solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or
      unresectable and for which standard curative therapies do not exist or are no longer
      effective.

      Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or biological
      therapy for at least 4 weeks.

      All patients enrolling in Group 2 must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy.

      ECOG performance status 0 or 1 and adequate organ and marrow function.

      DESIGN:

      Group 1 will receive dasatinib and bevacizumab together at the start of study in a dose
      escalation fashion.

      Group 2 will be randomized as to which agent they receive for cycle one. Cycles 2 and beyond
      are treated using both agents.

      Tumor biopsies will be obtained from patients in Group 2 before treatment, two weeks into
      mono-therapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.

      DCE-MRI studies will be obtained on patients in Group 2 before treatment, two weeks into
      monotherapy, four weeks into monotherapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.

      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity in clinic every 2 weeks for Cycles 1 and 2, and then
      every 4 weeks. For patients who have been on the study over 2 years, the cycle may be
      lengthened to 6 or 8 weeks at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using the RECIST criteria. After
      patients have completed 2 or more years on study, the interval may be lengthened to 12 or 16
      weeks at the discretion of the investigator.

      Approximately 48 patients will be needed to achieve the objectives of the trial.

             patients in group 1.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of dasatinib in combination with bevacizumab in
             patients less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be
             eligible for future pediatric phase 1 combination trials.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1. ECOG performance status of 2 will be considered on a
             case by case basis with a focused assessment on risk of perforation.

          -  Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy to at least CTEP
             grade 1 (defined by CTCAE 3.0). Chronic stable grade 2 peripheral neuropathy secondary
             to neurotoxicity from prior therapies may be considered on a case by case basis by the
             Principal Investigator.

          -  As the effect of dasatinib and bevacizumab in combination on the developing human
             fetus is not known, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (abstinence; hormonal or barrier method of birth control) for

               -  Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g. shortness of
                  breath, chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with
                  or without stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule
                  out QTc prolongation. The patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the
                  discretion of the principal investigator. Patients with underlying
                  cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be excluded from the

        study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Brain metastases

               -  Patients who have a history of remote CNS metastases that have undergone curative
                  therapy by radiation therapy, gamma knife therapy, or surgery and have remained
                  without recurrence for a period of greater than or equal 6 months will be
                  eligible.

               -  CNS imaging will not be mandated for all patients. However, if there is clinical
                  suspicion of CNS involvement, a contrast CT or MRI of the brain will be required.
                  Screening CNS scans should be required for certain tumor types with relatively
                  high risk of CNS metastases, including but not limited to melanoma, renal cell
                  carcinoma, breast, lung.

          -  Thrombotic or embolic events within the past 6 months such as a cerebrovascular
             accident (including transient ischemic attacks), pulmonary embolism, unstable angina,
             or myocardial infarction. Patients with recent (less than 3 month history) of venous
             thrombotic events will be considered on a case by case basis.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (AHA Class II or worse), unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

               -  Patients with evidence of active infection must have completed antibiotic therapy
                  and be without clinical or laboratory evidence of infection for seven days after
                  treatment has concluded.

               -  QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than 480 msecs)
                  or other clinically significant EKG abnormalities

               -  Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease including
                  the following:

               -  Myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months

               -  Prolonged QTc greater than or equal to 480msec (Fridericia correction)

               -  Ejection fraction less than institutional normal (should be done if clinically

                  considered on a case by case basis. Patients with a Grade 2, asymptomatic
                  pericardial effusion found incidentally on imaging studies may be considered on a
                  case by case basis.

               -  Dasatinib is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 liver enzyme. Consideration
                  should be given to using alternative medications not impacting CYP3A4 while on
                  dasatinib therapy.

               -  Patients may not be receiving any prohibited potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. For these
                  drugs, a wash-out period of greater than or equal to 7 days is required prior to
                  starting dasatinib treatment.

               -  Category I drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades
                  de Pointes. A wash-out period of greater than or equal to 7 days is required for
                  the following drugs prior to starting dasatinib treatment:

                       lidoflazine

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with dasatinib,
             bevacizumab, and/or the combination. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who have been treated with dasatinib (any other Src-family kinase inhibitors)
             will be excluded

          -  Hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic
             pressure greater than 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management.

          -  Proteinuria defined as a spot urine analysis for protein creatinine ratio (UPC) of
             greater than 1.0

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin, heparins, or heparinoids. Prophylaxis doses
             are permitted.

          -  Serious non-healing wounds (including wounds healing by secondary intention), acute or
             non-healing ulcers, or bone fractures within 3 months of fracture. History of
             abdominal fistula, major surgery, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscesses
             within 28 days will be excluded. Any patient with history of gastrointestinal
             perforation will be excluded due to possibility of increased risk of perforation with
             bevacizumab.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis

          -  Impairment of swallowing that would preclude administration of dasatinib.

          -  History of hemoptysis or surgery within the past 28 days.

          -  Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs will be excluded due to risk of
             fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. If a patient has a history of any type primary lung cancer
             and hemoptysis, they will be excluded.

          -  History of high grade varices.

          -  Use of herbal supplements are not permitted within 7 days of trial commencement and on
             study. Vitamin supplement (above a typical single multi-vitamin) usage is discouraged
             unless clearly indicated by an existing medical condition. An Associate or Principal
             Investigator will have the discretion regarding which vitamin supplements are
             permitted.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or recombinant human
             antibodies.

          -  Use of any other concurrent investigational agents for treatment or anticancer agents
             including hormonal therapy, except in the case of prostate cancer patients who are
             being treated with LHRH agonist at the time of trial entry

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an antibody to VEGF
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Dasatinib is a potential
             teratogen. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother bevacizumab or dasatinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.
