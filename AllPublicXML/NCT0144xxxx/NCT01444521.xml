  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line chemotherapy
      with cisplatin and irinotecan in advanced gastric cancer, and try to find out the optimal
      dosage of combination chemotherapy.

      Open label single arm phase II study of cisplatin and irinotecan in patients with advanced
      gastric carcinoma not previously treated with palliative chemotherapy. 40 Patients will be
      enrolled in this local trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      response rate of the treatment.Schedule for this study is as follows: 8 cycles/14 days of
      irinotecan 125 mg/m2 on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day2. This study will also include
      genotype investigations of UGT1A1 and ERCC1 expression in order to assess determinants of
      efficacy and toxicity of the treatment with cisplatin and irinotecan in the study population.
