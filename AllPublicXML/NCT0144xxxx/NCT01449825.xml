  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib is approved by the FDA and EMA as targeted therapy for the indication of advanced
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Hepatic safety events were observed in the pazopanib pivotal
      clinical trial and the U.S. pazopanib label information contains a 'black box warning'
      regarding hepatotoxicity. These clinical observations have prompted GSK to undertake a
      proactive pharmacovigilance strategy focused on hepatic safety that goes beyond spontaneous
      reporting of adverse events.

      The goals of the study are to assess prescriber compliance with pazopanib label guidelines
      for liver monitoring among patients with RCC, as well as to quantify and characterize the
      hepatic safety profile of the product in real-world clinical practice compared to other
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. As part of regulatory commitments,
      GSK will conduct parallel epidemiologic analyses in different patient populations as
      represented in multiple databases of electronic medical records. To enhance accrual of data,
      GSK will conduct this safety surveillance program simultaneously across datasets in order to
      detect and characterize all cases of liver enzyme elevations in diverse populations of
      patients receiving pazopanib. Two additional goals of this study are to evaluate the
      incidence of cases of combinations of liver enzyme elevations indicative of Hy's Law and
      drug-induced acute liver failure among users of pazopanib compared to users of other
      anti-VEGF drugs. This research effort will be coordinated by an external coordinating center.

      An epidemiologic cohort study design, nested in several databases of electronic medical
      information, will be employed for the research questions. Following the availability of
      pazopanib in the relevant medical care system, the study will collect retrospective data at
      regular intervals over the course of four years among persons exposed to pazopanib and other
      anti-VEGF agents. Each patient will be characterized based on additional available
      information in the database (e.g., demographics, concomitant medications). Elevations in
      liver enzymes will be identified through laboratory data captured in these databases.
      Potential Hy's Law and acute liver failure cases will be identified through established
      screening criteria, and screen-positive cases will be reviewed by an adjudication committee
      of hepatologists for final determination of drug-associated causality.
