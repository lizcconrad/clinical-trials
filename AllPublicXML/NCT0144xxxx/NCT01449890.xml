  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test in a randomized effectiveness trial if e-mail
      delivered cognitive behavioural treatment is an effective follow-up care approach in the
      treatment of depression under clinically representative conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression belongs to the most prevalent mental disorders and often goes along with a high
      burden of disease. Although the efficacy and the effectiveness of psychological treatments
      for depressive disorders have been demonstrated, there remains the problem of maintaining the
      benefits achieved during the initial treatment phase. Therefore options of follow-up care
      have to be considered. Since access to psychotherapeutic treatments is limited and costly,
      internet-based interventions can offer a feasible opportunity for follow-up care in order to
      enhance the long-term effectiveness of psychotherapy.

    <description>After having terminated inpatient CBT patients receive follow up care by email for 12 weeks (on average one contact per week). The follow up care aims at supporting the patients in continuing exercises they have learned during the initial treatment phase in order to cope with depression, e.g. integrating positive activities in their all day life or monitoring the interdependence of cognition, emotion and behaviour.</description>
