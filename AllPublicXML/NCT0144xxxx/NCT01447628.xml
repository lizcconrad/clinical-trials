  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish whether intravenous iron replacement has clinical benefit in
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

      A 24-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study will investigate
      whether a single dose of 1g of FerinjectÂ® or CosmoFer improves cardiopulmonary haemodynamics,
      exercise capacity and quality of life and is well-tolerated.
