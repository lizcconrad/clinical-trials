      This is the evaluation of an educational activity to promote health in the general population
      in order to establish healthy habits and changes in quality of life.

      We have designed a proposal for a workshop aimed at general public health which includes
      biological, psychological, social, cultural and spiritual health related and welfare. It is
      structured in 12 sessions that will provide tools that facilitate the involvement of people
      in maintaining their health.

      Content of the sessions: Breathing and Snuff. Food. Disposal. Physical activity. Sleep and
      rest. Appropriate clothing. Hygiene. Avoid danger. Communicate feelings and emotions. Feel
      useful. Recreational activities. Each participant is given a folder and at the end of each
      session a summary sheet of the same with the aim that at the end of the course have a
      reference material.

      To validate this material is piloted with the participation of 13 persons. Participants
      completed the SF36 questionnaire at the beginning and end of the workshop.
