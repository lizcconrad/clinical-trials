      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy (based on the pharmacokinetic profile
      of testosterone) and safety of TBS-1 in the treatment of hypogonadal men

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 4 Period study consists of 16 visits with overnight clinic stays that span
      over year to help determine the efficacy of TBS-1 gel administered twice daily (b.i.d) and
      three times daily (t.i.d)

      In addition, this study will investigate the safety and tolerability of TBS-1 after 90, 180
      and 360 days of treatment.
