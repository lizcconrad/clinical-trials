    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a loading dose of atorvastatin before
      percutaneous intervention procedures in acute coronary syndromes is effective to reduce major
      cardiovascular events(MACE).

      Background: Strategies to reduce complications in acute coronary syndrome treatment have been
      largely studied. Due to its pleiotropic effects statins are considered an important tool on
      atherosclerotic plaque stability. Although, the usage of statins before percutaneous coronary
      intervention in acute coronary syndrome patients, has not yet been demonstrated. Objectives:
      Evaluate if a loading dose of atorvastatin (80mg) before percutaneous coronary intervention
      in acute coronary syndrome patients, followed by a reload dose 24 hours, is able to reduce
      major cardiovascular events (MACE); including combined outcomes such as all-cause mortality,
      nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke or revascularization with either percutaneous
      coronary intervention or coronary-artery bypass grafting after 30 days. Methods: Multicentric
      randomised controlled clinical trial, with allocation concealment and intention to treat
      analysis. Competitive recruitment will involve 4,192 patients. Acute coronary syndrome
      patients intending to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention with or without stent
      placement will be randomized 1:1 to receive either atorvastatin 80mg or placebo before the
      coronary procedure and also a reload dosage after 24 hours from angioplasty. All patients
      will collect blood sample to determine CKMB levels pre and post procedure (6 to 12h and 18 to
      24 hours). After 30 days, an in person interview will be performed and blood sample will be
      collected in order to dosage AST, ALT, CPK, and cholesterol levels. Telephonic interview will
      be done at 6 and 12 months to access occurrence of cardiovascular events.
