  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to demonstrate that a local care strategy using URGO 310
      3082 dressing is not inferior to a reference therapeutic strategy using a hydrofibre dressing
      in the management of venous ulcers. This non-inferiority hypothesis will be judged on the
      planimetric relative regression of the wound surface area after six weeks of treatment.

    <measure>The efficacy of dressings under trial will be judged on the evolution of wound surface area after six weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 4 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The main evaluation criterion is the relative planimetric regression of the wound surface area, calculated according to the following formula, from centralised planimetric measurements:
Regression of the area (%) = [(ST0-STlast)/ST0] x 100 ST0: Surface area of the lesion measured on the day of inclusion STlast: Surface area of the lesion at the last planimetric evaluation available</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison between the two devices of percentage of lesions in which the evolution is positive (defined by a relative regression at least 40% of wound surface) after monitoring for 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 4 and 6</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison between the two groups of percentage of debrided lesions (defined by a lesion with more than 70% of its surface covered by granulation tissue of a &quot;red colour&quot; on the colorimetric scale), at the last available evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 4 and 6</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison between the two strategies of percentage of patients in whom at least one problem of pain was detected during care (VAS score at the end of care &gt; 30 mm)</measure>

    <measure>Comparison between the 2 groups of the percentage of wound care associated with manual debridement</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison between the two groups of the evolution of the patients' quality of life between inclusion and the last available visit. This quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol-5Dâ„¢ questionnaire</measure>
