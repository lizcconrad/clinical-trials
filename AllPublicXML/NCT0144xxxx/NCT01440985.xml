  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be smokers who want to quit, and have visible nicotine stains on their
      teeth. They will be given toothpaste and a toothbrush to use during the study, and will have
      an equal chance of being assigned to use either a nicotine gum or microtab. They will visit
      the study site five times during the 12 week trial to have their teeth examined.

    <textblock>
      This evaluator-blinded, randomized, 12-week parallel-group controlled trial compares
      Nicorette® Freshmint gum versus Nicorette® Microtab in healthy smokers who are motivated to
      quit smoking and who have visible staining of teeth.

      The trial is comprised of five visits (baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 6, and 12). At baseline,
      subjects will be provided with a standardized toothpaste and toothbrush; use of any other
      oral hygiene or tooth-whitening product is prohibited. At all visits after baseline, smoking
      status and use of study treatment will be checked. Teeth staining and teeth shade will be
      rated at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 Weeks using the Modified Lobene Stain Index and the
      Vita® Shade Guide, respectively.

    <description>After being randomized to the gum or tablet, dosage will be based on baseline level of nicotine dependence. Highly dependent smokers will receive nicotine 4 mg gum, while low nicotine-dependent smokers will receive nicotine 2 mg gum to help them quit. Subjects will be advised to use the treatment frequently, according to the product labeling, in order to minimize or avoid symptoms of tobacco withdrawal. Study medication will be used for 12 weeks.</description>
