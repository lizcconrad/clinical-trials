  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a new radiation treatment that delivers
      high-dose, precise radiation to small tumors in 1-3 weeks of treatment. This new technique
      can potentially allow radiation treatments to be focused more precisely, and delivered more
      accurately than with older treatments. This improvement could help by reducing side effects
      and by improving the chance of controlling the cancer by more precisely treating the cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to compare SABR with current approaches of chemotherapy and
      conventional radiotherapy to assess the impact on overall survival and quality of life.

      TREATMENT PLAN

      6.0.1 Standard Arm (Arm 1)

      Radiotherapy for patients in the standard arm should follow the principles of palliative
      radiotherapy as per the individual institution, with the goal of alleviating symptoms or
      preventing imminent complications. Patients in this arm should not receive stereotactic doses
      or radiotherapy boosts.

      Treatment recommendations are as follows:

      Brain: Whole brain radiotherapy i.e. 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions

      Lung: Palliative radiotherapy as per 2011 consensus guidelines.15 i.e. 8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20
      Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions

      Bone: Palliative radiotherapy as per 2011 consensus guidelines.16 i.e. 8 Gy in 1 fraction
      (most common), 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions

      Liver: 20 Gy in 5 fractions if standard institutional practice

      6.0.2 Treatment Planning for Standard Arm

      Treatment planning is to be done using CT simulation or conventional simulation (fluoroscopy)
      as per individual institutional practice. Simple beam arrangements, such as parallel opposed
      beams, are favored wherever possible.

      6.1 Experimental Arm (Arm 2)

      All treatments in this study are based on current protocols in clinical use at the LRCP and
      VUmc for treatment of lung,17 liver,18 brain,19,20 and spinal cord21 metastases. The guiding
      principle for radiotherapy is to achieve disease control but to minimize any potential
      adverse impact on quality of life. Concurrent chemotherapy or targeted therapy at the time of
      radiotherapy is not permitted within the 4 weeks prior to SABR. Hormone therapy is permitted.

      6.1.1 Dose/Fractionation

      Lung- tumors 3 cm or less surrounded by lung parenchyma, 54(Gy) in 3 fractions

        -  Abutting chest wall or &gt;3 cm, 55(Gy)in 5 fractions, every second day

        -  Within 2 cm of mediastinum or brachial plexus, 60(Gy),8* fractions, every second day

      Bone -Any bone except femur,35(Gy), in 5 fractions,daily

        -  vertebral body,16-20(Gy)in 1 fraction, single dose, or 30Gy in 3 fractions, every second
           day

      Brain - Non-radiosurgical,40(Gy) to metastases, in 5 fractions,daily

        -  If whole brain treated, then simultaneous boost to each lesion,20 Gy whole brain
           (optional), in 5 fractions, daily

        -  Radiosurgical, ≤1 cm, 22-24(Gy), in 1 fraction, &gt;1 and ≤2 cm, 22-24(Gy) in 1 fraction &gt;2
           and ≤ 3 cm, 18-20(Gy) in 1 fraction Optional whole brain to follow (see text) Liver-LRCP
           site: Dose is based on calculated normal tissue probability of &lt;5%,Every second day

        -  other sites 45-60(Gy), in 3-8 fractions, every second day

      Adrenal, 60 (Gy), in 8 fractions, every second day

      (If whole brain treated, then simultaneous boost to each lesion)

      6.1.2 Immobilization

      Treatment will be setup using reproducible positioning, verified using an on-line protocol,
      for all patients in this study. Immobilization may include a custom immobilization device,
      such as thermoplastic shell or vac-lok bag, as per individual institutional practice when
      delivering SABR. Some centers do not use immobilization devices and have demonstrated high
      degrees of accuracy; this is acceptable in this study.

      6.1.3 Imaging/Localization/Registration All patients in Arm 2 will undergo planning CT
      simulation. 4-dimensional CT will be used for tumors in the lungs or liver. Axial CT images
      will be obtained throughout the region of interest. For centres using stereotactic
      radiosurgery platforms, real-time tumor tracking and orthogonal imaging systems are
      permitted.

      Any center which is not yet experienced in lesions at any specific sub-site (e.g. adrenal
      metastases) shall be eligible to participate by including only patients with lesions at other
      pre-specified sites

      It is strongly recommended that the doses to organs at risk are not to be exceeded - in some
      specific cases, this may require lower doses or higher fractionations than listed here. Such
      changes in dose will require approval of one of the local principal investigators. (see
      section 6.2)
