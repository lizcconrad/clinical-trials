  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of the 12-year-old children in China have dental caries (tooth decay) and most of
      the lesions are in the fissures of the first permanent molars. This study aims to investigate
      the effectiveness of three methods in preventing fissure caries in permanent teeth in Chinese
      children, namely resin fissure sealant, sodium fluoride varnish, and silver diamine fluoride
      solution. The cost-effectiveness of these methods will also be compared. About 400 children,
      aged 8 to 9 years, will be recruited. Clinical examination of the children will be conducted
      in school using portable dental lights and instruments to identify teeth that need caries
      prevention. The children will be randomly allocated to one of the three test or the control
      groups. Treatments will be provided in the study primary schools according to standard
      clinical protocols. Follow-up examinations will be carried out every six months for 30 months
      to assess whether the preventive methods are successful, i.e. no dental caries develops in
      the treated teeth. The findings of this study will be of great value to dentists and public
      health authorities in deciding on the most appropriate dental caries prevention programme for
      school children in China and other developing countries.
