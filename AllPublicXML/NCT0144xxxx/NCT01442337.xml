      This is a two-part study. Part 1 (Phase 2) has completed enrollment. Subjects are currently
      being followed per protocol. Data from Part 1 will be used to determine the doses used in
      Part 2 (Phase 3). Part 2 will enroll approximately 573 subjects and is planned to have 2
      doses of ASP8597 (low dose and either the high or highest dose) along with placebo.
