      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether meclizine, an antihistamine used to prevent
      or treat motion sickness, can help smokers quit smoking. This study will also investigate the
      potential relationship between genes you have inherited and success in quitting smoking.

          <description>To further validate the association between a decrease in expired air CO before the quit date and subsequent abstinence, the decrease in expired air CO from baseline to week 3 (Session P3) will be compared between abstinent and non-abstinent smokers, using ANOVA.</description>

      <time_frame>Subjects were receiving study drugs for nine weeks. At each study session during this period subjects completed a questionnaire about side effects. Subjects were also told to contact us between study sessions if side effects were bothersome.</time_frame>
      <desc>Eight subjects discontinued study participation after the first study session; therefore, no side effects data were collected. Six of these subjects were in the control group, two of these subjects were in the 25mg Meclizine group and none were in the 50mg Meclizine group.</desc>

Nicotine patches: Pre-Quit Period: During weeks two and three, participants will apply active 21mg/24h nicotine patches daily.
Post-Quit Period: Following the quit-day these participants will apply active nicotine patches daily using the following dose schedule: 21mg/24h for four weeks, 14mg/24h for one week, and 7mg/24h for one week.</description>
