  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When facing life threatening illness such as advanced cancer palliative care is needed to
      improve quality of life of patients and their families through the prevention and relief of
      suffering. Palliative care at an early stage prevents the development of problems and
      symptoms, but time, resources and experience are needed in the primary care sector in Denmark
      to deal with the problems families experiencing life with advanced cancer are facing. The
      aims of this study are to test, evaluate and further develop interventions that can help
      identify and assess problems, resources and opportunities of families experiencing life with
      advanced cancer, and on this background to help the families cope with their situation in
      cooperation with healthcare professionals to an extent where the family's quality of life
      increases, their physical and psychosocial problems are relieved, their symptoms of anxiety
      and depression are reduced, family satisfaction with health professionals are increased and
      acute readmissions to hospital are prevented.

      Screening for patients will take place in the oncological, gynecological medical, surgical
      departments of three hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark among patients diagnosed with cancer.
      Patients eligible for the study will be informed about the study during hospital admission
      and asked to participate together with a close relative/family member. When written informed
      consent has been obtained from both patient and relative they will be asked to fill in
      questionnaires with background information about sociodemographic data, their physical and
      psychosocial functioning and quality of life EORTC (QLQ-C30/patient and SF36/relative), their
      symptoms of anxiety and depression (HAD Scale/patient and relative) and family satisfaction
      with health care professionals(FamCare/relative). When patients have been discharge from
      hospital to their own home the families are randomized to control or intervention group.
      First visit from the research nurse takes place no later than one week after randomization.
      Visits takes place week 1,4,7,10,13 and 16 after randomization. The questionnaires EORTC
      QLQ-C30 (patient), HAD Scale (patient and relative), SF 36 (relative) and FamCare (relative)
      are mailed by post to the families to be answered at week 9, 16 and 24 after randomization.
      Information about the amount of care the family receives from the municipality (standard
      homecare) will be obtained from municipal registers. Information about readmissions to
      hospital are obtained from hospital registers.

      The research nurses has a minimum of one year experience within specialised palliative care.
      The nurses has also participated in a two day course on how to produce and utilise family
      assessment and have been introduced to the background theory on coping and family nursing.

    <description>In addition to the standard homecare nursing the families will receive six home visits from a research nurse with at least 1 year specialised palliative care experience. During the first 2 hour visit a family assessment is obtained containing identification of family roles, resources and coping strategies. The first home visit takes place no later than one week after randomization. The visits continues every third week up to 16 weeks, each visit with a duration of 1,5 hours. At every visit the EORTC-QLQ-C30 patient administered questionnaire is used to identify the nature, frequency and intensity of the patients physical and psychosocial problems.</description>

The nurse provides knowledge to the family on how to prevent and/or cope with problems that may occur or re-occur and/or accepts or adapt to unsolvable problems.</description>
