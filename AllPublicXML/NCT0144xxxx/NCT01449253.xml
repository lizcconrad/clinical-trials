    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, interventional study indented to find the efficacy of
      different treatment regimens in treatment of pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease
      and/or hypoxia.This is to find out when to start combination therapy (sildenafil plus
      bosentan) in treatment of pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease and/or hypoxia.

      This is an open label, randomized, interventional study indented to find the efficacy of
      different treatment regimens in treatment of pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease
      and/or hypoxia. It involves 3 arms, one getting monotherapy with sildenafil for 6 months, 2nd
      getting bosentan monotherapy initially for 3 months and then combination of sildenafil and
      bosentan for 3 months, 3rd getting combination sildenafil and bosentan from the beginning for
      6 months. The aim is to decide when is the best time to start combination therapy either from
      start or at the time of drug failure. Improvement will be assessed by change in functional
      class, pulmonary pressures measured by ECHO, pulmonary function test, six minute walk test
      and biochemical markers. Lack of randomized trials and Indian data is there on the subject.
      Also adverse events and serious adverse events will be closely monitored and reported to the
      ethics committee and DCGI immediately.
