    <description>The plasma concentration versus time data of dronabinol and its metabolite (11-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) will be analyzed. The PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUCinf for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol will be calculated and used as the measures for comparative bioavailability assessment of dronabinol oral solution versus the innovator capsule product.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female healthy subjects between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) within 19 and 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive and
             weigh a minimum of 50 kg (110 pounds).

          3. Subjects must be in general good health as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, or laboratory evaluations conducted at the screening visit and upon
             admission to the clinic. Examination should include a thorough examination of oral
             cavity for any abnormal findings.

          4. Subjects must be non-smokers, defined as not having used any tobacco products in the
             past six months. Negative results from a urine cotinine test conducted at Screening.

          5. Subjects must be able to provide informed consent after risks and benefits have been
             explained, and be willing to comply with study procedures.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or nursing; and must be
             surgically sterile; one year postmenopausal; or on hormonal contraceptive agent(s),
             diaphragm or condom with spermicidal foam or jelly, or IUD for at least three months
             prior to drug administration and agree to use the same method of contraception for at
             least one month after the last drug administration.

          7. Negative urine pregnancy test at screening and prior to drug administration of each
             period.

          8. Negative HIV 1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen within
             30 days prior to the start of the study.

             sesame oil.

          2. Have participated in an investigational trial within 30 days or six half-lives of the
             test drug's biologic activity, whichever is longer, before the time of first study
             dose in this study.

          3. Presence of visible signs of an infection, mucositis, cold sores, lesions, local
             irritation, periodontal disease of the oral cavity or any abnormal finding in the oral
             cavity. In addition, evidence of piercings of the tongue, lip, or anywhere in the oral
             cavity or a history of oral cavity piercings.

          4. Have donated or received blood or blood products within 30 days prior to the first
             study dose.

             of study drug administration, over-the-counter drugs within seven days of study drug
             administration, and/or vitamins or herbal supplements within three days of study drug
             administration.

          6. Significant bradycardia or tachycardia defined as having a resting heart rate &lt;45 bpm
             or &gt;100 bpm, respectively.

          7. Clinical evidence of either hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg
             or diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 mmHg), or hypertension (defined as systolic blood
             pressure &gt;139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;89 mmHg).

          8. Any history of clinically significant organ system (cardiovascular, neurological,
             hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, pulmonary, endocrine, or gastrointestinal) disorders or
             ongoing infectious diseases; or any other conditions that might interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug, or that would
             place the subject at increased risk.

          9. Use of marijuana (directly or indirectly) within 90 days prior to drug administration
             and during the course of the study.

         10. History of treatment for alcohol abuse, significant mental illness, physical
             dependence to any opioid, barbiturates, amphetamines, cocaine, or benzodiazepines in
