  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) to treat patients with chronic limb
      ischemia has been proved safe and effective. However, processing bone marrow by Ficoll
      density gradient centrifugation is not only time consuming but also expensive. Manually
      processing of bone marrow also results in large variation in therapeutic cell quantity and
      quality which directly leads deviation of safety and efficacy of the cell therapy. This study
      is aiming to compare an automated bone marrow processing system with a conventional manual
      method in term of safety and efficacy.

      Using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) to treat patients with chronic limb
      ischemia has been proved safe and effective. However, processing bone marrow by Ficoll
      density gradient centrifugation is not only time consuming but also expensive. Manually
      processing of bone marrow also results in large variation in therapeutic cell quantity and
      quality which directly lead deviation of safety and efficacy of the cell therapy. This study
      is aiming to compare an automated bone marrow processing system with a conventional manual
      method in term of safety and efficacy.

      ResQ system developed by Thermogenesis in USA provides an automatic cell processing system
      for bone marrow. The system takes less than 30 minutes to concentrate the therapeutic
      mononuclear cells including stem cells in a closed system without adding any additive such as
      separation reagent (Ficoll). The system also be able to be operated at point of care.

      The study is designed to prove no inferior of safety and efficacy of bone marrow cells
      processed by ResQ to those of cells using conventional manual method. The conventional manual
      method is involved Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and cell washing stems in an open
      system. Each of test arms (ResQ vs manual method) consists of 25 patients. The primary
      outcome is safety which is measured by cell treatment-related adverse events. The secondary
      endpoints include resting ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI)and toe brachial pressure index
      (TBI) , transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), claudication distance, rest pain scale
      evaluation, collateral vessel scale, etc.
