  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective randomised study design to investigate, if a systematic risk factor
      screening for bleeding ulcer in patients, who following percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) commence a one year combination treatment with low dose aspirin and clopidogrel,
      followed by prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in case of increased
      risk, can reduce the risk of bleeding ulcer. Based on the recently raised suspicion that
      PPI's, possibly except pantoprazole, reduce the effect of ADP-receptor inhibitors,
      pantoprazole has been chosen as prophylaxis in the screening group, and analyses will be done
      to ascertain whether PPI treatment increases the risk of coronary events. Further analyses
      will be made to see whether PPI prophylaxis in high risk patients can increase compliance
      with the antithrombotic treatment through a reduction of side effects, thereby reducing the
      risk of myocardial infarction in particular stent thrombosis. The study population will be
      analyzed further to identify the patients, who will benefit the most from PPI prophylaxis
      Hypothesis: screening heart patients for risk factors for bleeding ulcer and subsequently
      treating high risk patients with PPI can reduce the incidence of bleeding ulcer and increase
      compliance with the antithrombotic treatment; thereby possibly reducing the risk of coronary
      events and improving survival. Initial a description of the prevalence of risk factors will
      be done.

    <description>Following PCI the patients fill out a questionnaire to assess the risk factors for ulcer bleeding.We randomise between:
screening and risk assessment
control group
All screened patients, who fulfil the criteria for having a moderate to high risk of ulcer bleeding will be sent written information about risk factors and the purpose of the PPI prophylaxis. They will be recommended PPI prophylaxis (Pantoprazole), as long as they are being treated with low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel.
Patients in the screening group, who are already on PPI treatment is recommended to change to Pantoprazole.
Definition of risk of ulcer bleeding: The table below will be used for screening. Patients scoring ≥ 2 points will receive PPI prophylaxis.
points: Age: &lt; 60: 0; 60-69: 1; 70-79: 2; &gt;=80: 3 ___ Dyspepsia: 1 ___ Uncomplicated ulcer: 2 ___ Complicated ulcer 3 ___ NSAID 2 ___ Steroids 2 ___ SSRI 2 ___ Anticoagulant Tx 2 ___</description>
