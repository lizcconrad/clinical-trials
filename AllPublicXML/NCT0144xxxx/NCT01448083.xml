  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the measurement (with a standard nuclear camera)
      of radioactivity normally present in the nervous system of your heart at four hours after the
      injection of radioactive drug for your diagnostic I-123 MIBG scan is any different than
      radioactivity measured in your heart at one and/or two hours after your diagnostic scan
      injection. If equivalent information to the conventional 4 hr H/M ratio could be collected by
      obtaining H/M ratios at 1 or 2 hour windows, it would greatly facilitate patient acceptance
      of the procedure since the requirements for obtaining a valid H/M ratio would be considerably
      less time-consuming.

      One hour before being injected with the drug (I-123 MIBG) for your MIBG scan, you will be
      given a standard dose of non-radioactive iodine (Lugol's solution) to block your thyroid from
      receiving the small amount of radiation that is a normal part of the MIBG scan. You will then
      be injected with MIBG, and you will have 10 minute pictures of your chest at 15 minutes, 1
      hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours in addition to the standard 24 hour pictures. These pictures will
      be taken in the Nuclear Medicine Section, Department of Radiology at Ochsner Medical
      Center-Kenner. The experimental (research) part of this study is having the extra 10-minute
      pictures of your chest at 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours. Normally, pictures are
      only taken 24 hours after the injection. Therefore the research is limited to the four extra
      pictures taken, and involve no additional injections or I-123 drug beyond that you will be
      receiving regardless of whether you are part of this research.

    <description>Each subject will receive a 370 MBq (10 mCi ) (±10%) injection of I- 123 MIBG. Myocardial I-123 MIBG uptake will be quantitatively measured over time via planar imaging acquired at 15 minutes, one, two, four, and at 24 hours (the standard of care time point for NET patient imaging) post I-123MIBG injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. NET patients who are potential candidates for I-131 MIBG therapy, and are having whole
             body I-123 MIBG scintigraphy as standard of care.

          2. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Written informed consent from patients obtained in accordance to local guidelines.

          4. History and physical exam indicating low likelihood, &lt; 10 %, of any significant
             cardiac disease.

          5. Echocardiogram within normal limits, including absence of valvular disease and normal
             LVEF.

          6. Serum BNP within normal limits. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients on drugs which interfere with MIBG uptake - tricyclic antidepressants,
             phenylpropanolamine, pseudephredine, phenylephrine, sympathomimetics, amphetamines,
             reserpine, thorazine and thiothixines, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, and
             long-acting beta blockers.

          2. &gt;10% likelihood of any significant heart disease, including myocardial ischemia,
             cardiomyopathies, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and valvular
             heart disease, e.g. see &quot;Likelihood of Assessment of Coronary Artery Disease&quot; below.

          3. History of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          4. Signs/symptoms of neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinsonian syndromes) or other
             disease known to affect the sympathetic nervous system.

          5. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing (lactating), or adults of reproductive
             potential who are not using effective birth control methods. If there is any question
             of pregnancy, a serum bHCg will be collected.
