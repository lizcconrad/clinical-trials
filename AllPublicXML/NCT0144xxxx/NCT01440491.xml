  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercises performed under monitoring of
      the physiotherapist and self performed at home by reading the booklet of exercise orientation
      for patients with nonspecific low back pain.

      A prospective and randomized trial was performed in 44 patients. G1 patients received a
      physiotherapist orientation, and G2 patients received the booklet of exercise to self perform
      the exercises. Pain intensity by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and quality of life by SF-36
      were measured before.

      Results: Pain intensity was lower in G1 than in G2 after 6 and 12 weeks. Quality of life was
      better in G1.

      The exercises under orientations of the physiotherapist promoted best effect than self
      performed exercises .

    <textblock>
      After approval by the Ethics Committee and signing a consent form, a prospective, randomized
      trial was performed in 44 patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (lasting longer
      than 3 months), pain intensity greater than 3 by visual analogue scale and age &gt; 18 years.
      Patients with renal and gastrointestinal disease, simultaneously submitted to another type of
      physical therapy, cognitive impairment, and pregnant women were excluded.

      All patients received an exercise booklet which consisted of stretching and strengthening of
      muscles. G1 patients were orientated by the physiotherapist during the performance of
      exercises once a week, using the booklet, and the patients in G2 (n=22) received the booklet
      to self perform the exercises without orientation of the physiotherapist. Everyone should
      perform the exercises once a day at home.

      Pain intensity by VAS, and quality of life by SF-36 were measured before the start of
      treatment (T0), after 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) weeks. Side effects were recorded. Acetaminophen
      (up to 4 g / day) could be used as necessary.

      The sample size was provided by SAS 8.0, SPSS 15.0 program. To detect difference in pain
      intensity of 3 between the groups by VAS, with 95% of power (estimated SD= 2.0), when the
      alpha level is set at 0.05, the sample should be of 16. The program used for statistical
      analysis was SAS 8.0, SPSS 15.0. The tests used were Student's T to compare age of patients,
      chi-square to compare gender and analgesic complementation, and Mann Whitney test for pain
      intensity and quality of life.
