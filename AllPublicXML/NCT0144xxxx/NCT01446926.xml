    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the safety and tolerability of an investigational
      pneumococcal vaccine through a step-down enrollment.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an investigational pneumococcal vaccine.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of an investigational pneumococcal vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All adult participants will receive a single injection of study vaccine or placebo. After
      satisfactory safety evaluation, toddler participants will receive a single injection of study
      vaccine or placebo. After satisfactory safety evaluation, infant participants will receive 3
      injections of study vaccine or placebo in dose-ascending order (low, medium, and high dose),
      with a safety evaluation after each dose level before the study proceeds to the next higher
      dose. All participants will undergo immunogenicity testing and monitoring for safety.

             witness.

          -  Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures.

             unable to read the informed consent form, a procedure will be followed to ensure
             his/her understanding of the process and will be marked by the subject's parent(s) or
             other legally acceptable representative and signed by a witness.

          -  Participation or planned participation in another clinical trial investigating a
             vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the first
             trial vaccination except if non-interventional follow-up for an earlier study (e.g.,
             long-term surveillance).

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination, or
             planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following the trial vaccination.

          -  Previous vaccination against S. pneumoniae (in the previous 5 years).

          -  History of pneumococcal infection (confirmed microbiologically) within 5 years.

          -  Receipt of blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months, which might interfere
             with assessment of the immune response.

          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of
             immunosuppressive therapy such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within
             the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or
             equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a
             life-threatening reaction to the vaccine used in the trial or to a vaccine containing
             any of the same substances.

          -  Bleeding disorder, including thrombocytopenia contraindicating intramuscular (IM)
             vaccination, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion.

          -  Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,
             or hospitalized involuntarily.

          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction.

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with trial conduct or completion.

          -  (Adults only): Identified as employees of the Investigator or study center, with
             direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that
             Investigator or study center, as well as family members (i.e., immediate, husband,
             wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the employees or the Investigator.

          -  (Infants and Toddlers only): Parents or guardians identified as employees of the
             Investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other
             studies under the direction of that Investigator or study center, as well as family
             members (i.e., immediate, husband, wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the
             employees or the Investigator.

          -  Febrile illness (temperature ≥38.0°C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection
             (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination.

          -  Receipt of oral or injected antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to any blood draw
             (for immunogenicity assessment).
