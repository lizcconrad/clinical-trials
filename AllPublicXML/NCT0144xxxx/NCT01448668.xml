      Efficacy and safety of a supportive treatment with European mistletoe extract Iscador® Qu
      (&quot;quercus&quot;, i.e. from oak tree) in patients with pancreatic cancer (Union for International
      Cancer Control, UICC stages II-IV), in addition to conventional oncological therapy (radio-,
      chemo-, targeted therapy) as compared to a parallel group with conventional therapy only.

      Primary Endpoints: Reduction of adverse effects of conventional therapy; reduction of therapy
      or disease induced symptoms (both are quality of life parameters and evaluated after 1 year);
      prolongation of disease free and/or overall survival (DFS, OS) after 3 years.

      Prospective observational confirmation study of previous retrospective cohort study.

      As this is a non-interventional cohort study, all therapies and measurements are performed on
      directive by the treating physician and/or request by the patient only.
