    <description>Change from baseline in the degree of infiltration of the epidermis by inflammatory cells following treatment with ingenol mebutate gel, 0.05% as assessed by Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) in actinic keratosis (AK) skin.This RCM imaging technique is a relatively new non-invasive, real-time evaluation method to generate horizontal skin sections at a resolution comparable to routine histology.
The degree of infiltration of the epidermis by inflammatory cells will be based on &quot;inflammation/small bright cells&quot; (grading 0-3) as assessed by RCM from baseline across the trial period for the subjects receiving PEP005 Gel. The degree of infiltration of the dermis by inflammatory cells will be based on &quot;inflammatory cells in the dermis&quot; (grading 0-3) as assessed by RCM from baseline across the trial period for the subjects receiving PEP005 Gel.</description>

The degree of infiltration of the epidermis by inflammatory cells will be based on “inflammation/small bright cells” (grading 0-3) as assessed by RCM from baseline across the trial period for the subjects receiving PEP005 Gel. The degree of infiltration of the dermis by inflammatory cells will be based on “inflammatory cells in the dermis” (grading 0-3) as assessed by RCM from baseline across the trial period for the subjects receiving PEP005 Gel.</description>
