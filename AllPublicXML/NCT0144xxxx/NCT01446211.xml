  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy (superiority testing) of gusperimus compared
      to conventional treatment in patients with a relapse of Wegener Granulomatosis with or
      without ongoing steroids, and/or immunosuppressive therapy. Further, to evaluate the safety
      and quality of life of gusperimus treatment compared to standard treatment in patients with
      relapse of Wegener Granulomatosis receiving glucocorticoids.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wegener Granulomatosis without treatment is life-threatening. The standard treatment with
      corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is usually effective at controlling active disease.
      However, disease relapse is frequent and requires increased exposure to these toxic drugs. In
      other patients initiation or continuation of these standard drugs is contraindicated due to
      intolerable side effects. No well-established therapy is available for relapsing patients.
      They may suffer severe organ damage due to progressive disease, or may die. The proposed
      indication for gusperimus is the treatment of relapsing Wegener Granulomatosis. The aim of
      therapy with gusperimus is to induce and maintain remission thereby avoiding further
      cyclophosphamide and reducing corticosteroid exposure.

i) Remission - defined as the complete absence of active clinical disease, i.e. a BVAS score of 0, for at least two months on a stable prednisone dose of ≤ 10 mg/day.
