  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, and many people with Type 1 Diabetes
      like to take part in regular sport and exercise. The majority of people with Type 1 Diabetes
      are treated with a &quot;basal bolus&quot; insulin regimen, with background insulin provided by
      long-acting &quot;basal&quot; insulin doses, and &quot;bolus&quot; doses of short-acting insulin used to
      accompany food intake. Evidence shows that the main factor preventing people with diabetes
      from pursuing a more active lifestyle is fear of low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). A
      previous study has shown that the type of background insulin affects the likelihood of an
      individual suffering hypoglycaemia during exercise and for 2 and a half hours afterwards. The
      aim of this study is to examine this further.

      The two most commonly used long-acting insulins, insulin glargine and insulin detemir, will
      be compared. Previous data suggests that there is a greater likelihood of hypoglycaemia with
      insulin glargine than insulin detemir. Exercise intensity can have an influence on the
      likelihood of hypoglycaemia, and in this previous study exercise intensity was measured using
      heart rate. This study will use a more formal definition of exercise intensity. The
      investigators will study blood glucose during exercise, but also metabolism as measured by
      hormones affecting blood glucose levels as well as markers of fat metabolism. The
      investigators will also use a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to consider
      hypoglycaemia on thei night following exercise as this is a recognised consequence of
      exercise in type 1 diabetes.

      The null hypothesis to be tested in this study is that there is no difference between the two
      insulins in their effect on blood glucose levels and metabolism during exercise and rates of
      nocturnal hypoglycaemia after exercise.

      A1: At the first appointment, potential participants will be screened regarding the inclusion
      criteria, and if eligible to take part the study information sheet will be discussed with
      them in detail. Written, informed consent will be obtained if participants are willing to
      take part in the study. Participants will be given advice and support from this point in
      order to optimise basal insulin therapy using their usual basal insulin.

      A2: Following a period of at least 3 weeks from recruitment into the study, participants will
      have their maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 MAX - a measure of capacity for physical exercise)
      assessed.

      A3: After at least 4 weeks following recruitment , to allow time for optimisation of basal
      insulin therapy, and at least one week following A2, the participant's metabolism will then
      be assessed during and after 60 minutes of exercise at 50% VO2 MAX. Participants will be
      fitted with a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to monitor glucose levels for the
      24 hours after exercise finishes.

      A4: At least 24 hours and no more than 7 days after A3 the participant will switched to using
      the other trial insulin for basal insulin therapy. Again, participants will be provided with
      advice and support in order to optimise treatment.

      A5: At least 4 weeks following A4, the participant's metabolism will once again be assessed
      during and after 60 minutes of exercise at 50% VO2 MAX. Participants will again be fitted
      with CGMS to monitor glucose levels for the 24 hours after exercise finishes.

      A6: Once the 24 hours after exercise are complete, the study finishes and participants
      re-start their usual basal insulin.
