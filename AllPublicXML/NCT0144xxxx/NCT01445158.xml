      Background:

        -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) represents the second most frequent major
           organ transplant in the United States.

        -  Pediatric 1st degree stem cell donors can experience a variety of psychological
           difficulties before and after donation with those who feel they are not adequately
           prepared for possible complications following stem cell donation and transplant
           describing negative emotions.

        -  The importance of preparation for children undergoing medical procedures has long been
           recognized in the field of pediatric psychology

      Objectives:

        -  To assess how prepared pediatric donors are for stem cell donation by assessing their
           knowledge about stem cell transplants, and to assess their anxiety at different stages
           of the donation process.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of a workbook and a board game as tools for conveying
           information on donation and transplantation to donors.

        -  To identify donors who may require additional preparation before stem cell collection.

        -  To explore the relationship between donor knowledge and anxiety symptoms.

      Eligibility:

      -Stem cell donors ages 10 to 26 years of age

      Design:

        -  Participant s baseline knowledge and anxiety are evaluated.

        -  Participant s knowledge is reassessed and anxiety evaluated following an information
           session with the research nurse and doctor about the procedures for stem cell donation
           and discussion of the consent form for the transplant protocol.

        -  Participants are separated into two groups. Donors 10 to 15 years of age play a board
           game; those 16 to 26 years of age are given a workbook on stem cell transplant.

        -  Participants knowledge and anxiety are reassessed within 24 hours after working with the
           educational materials and again 1 month later.

      Background:

        -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) represents the second most frequent major
           organ transplant in the United States.

        -  A variety of psychological difficulties in sibling donors post-stem cell donation are
           reported, including withdrawal, guilt, anger, depression, anxiety, mild to severe
           psychopathology, and post-traumatic stress symptomatology.

        -  The importance of preparation for children undergoing medical procedures has long been
           recognized in the field of pediatric psychology. In previous research, siblings who felt
           they were not adequately prepared for possible complications following HSCT donation and
           transplant often described negative emotions.

        -  Some siblings have reported feeling pressured and coerced to become a donor, while
           others describe a lack of attention to their physical fears associated with donation and
           their psychological concerns.

        -  No prospective studies examining educational tools and transplant knowledge in sibling
           stem cell donors are currently available.

      Objectives:

        -  To assess pediatric 1st degree stem cell donor comprehension of transplant procedures
           and compare knowledge prior to educational interventions (pre and post-consent
           informational session) to knowledge following educational interventions.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of a workbook intervention as a learning tool for conveying
           information on stem cell donation and transplantation to pediatric donors.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of a board game intervention (ShopTalk) as a learning tool
           for conveying information on stem cell donation and transplantation to pediatric donors.

        -  To identify donors who may require additional preparation prior to stem cell collection.

        -  To measure donor anxiety pre and post the educational intervention and stem cell
           donation and explore the relationship between donor knowledge and anxiety symptoms.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age: 10 to 26 years of age

        -  Participants or their parents must consent to participation in active bone marrow and
           peripheral blood stem cell transplant protocols at the NIH.

        -  For donors less than 18 years of age, their legal guardian must give informed consent,
           the donor must give written assent.

        -  For donors greater than or equal to 18 years of age, ability to give informed consent.

        -  Participants must understand and read English or Spanish.

      Design:

        -  Baseline knowledge will be assessed following consent.

        -  Knowledge will be reassessed following the information session for the transplant
           protocol

        -  Donors will be stratified into 2 groups by age. Donors ages 10 to 15 will be scheduled
           the following day to play a game called ShopTalk. Donors ages 16 to 26 will be given a
           workbook on HSCT specifically designed for 1st degree stem cell donors. Knowledge will
           be reassessed following the administration of these interventions.

        -  A follow-up assessment will be administered to all participants 1 month after the post
           intervention test was administered.
