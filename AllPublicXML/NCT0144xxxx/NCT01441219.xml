  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) has been one of the most challenging area in the
      field of gastroenterology, as small bowel is beyond the reach of ordinary endoscopes like
      oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) and colonoscopy. Thanks for the latest technological
      advancement for investigating small intestine, we are now capable of obtaining intraluminal
      images safely through capsule endoscopy (CE). Its role in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding,
      Crohn's disease and other small bowel pathologies has already been proven, and nowadays it is
      suggested by various authorities to be the first-line modality among all small bowel
      investigations.

      The investigators group has showed that CE can alter the clinical management of patients with
      OGIB - patients with negative CE has lower rebleeding rate, and therefore we may adopt a
      conservative approach for them. Although supported by some other group as well, conflicting
      results were still reported in the literature about the out-come of these patients. The main
      criticisms for these studies are that, CE can only identify 61% of the underlying small bowel
      bleeding pathology, and one can never ascertain the outcome of patients with negative CE
      examination. Apparently there is still room for improvement in the current CE technology.

      Newer generation of CE (PillCam ColonTM) has been developed to investigate the large bowel.
      It is different from small bowel CE that it consists of two cameras at both ends of the
      capsule, so as to enhance the coverage of colonic mucosa visualization. An improved
      generation of this colon capsule, named PillCam Colon 2TM, is also in its developmental
      phase. With the new &quot;adaptive frame rate&quot; (AFR) technology, the CE optimizes the visual
      coverage of the bowel by increasing the frame rate up to 35 frames per second when the
      capsule is moving quickly in certain areas, while decreasing the frame rate down to 4 frames
      per second when the capsule is moving slowly or remains stationary so as to conserve the
      battery life. Preliminary data from colorectal cancer screening has shown that it could
      improve the diagnostic yield of colonic polyps.

      The investigators hypothesize that, by re-programming the PillCam Colon 2TM so as to initiate
      AFR since ingestion, it could improve the visualization of small intestinal lumen and hence
      improves the sensitivity of small bowel CE examination.
