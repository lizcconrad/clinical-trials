  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research is to determine whether injecting mesenchymal precursor
      cells (MPC) into the heart during surgery to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      is safe. MPCs are normally present in human bone marrow, and have been shown to increase the
      development of blood vessels and new heart muscle cells in the heart. In addition, this
      research is being done to test whether injecting the MPCs into the heart is effective in
      improving heart function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPC) in patients with advanced
      heart failure who are treated with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation may
      result in a renewable source of proliferating functional cardiomyocytes, as well as induce
      development of capillaries and larger size blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to
      endogenous myocardium and newly-implanted cardiomyocytes, and release factors capable of
      paracrine signaling. If safety is established and an efficacy signal is observed in this
      exploratory trial, then the investigators will design a follow-up trial (stage 2) based on an
      adaptive design. The next trial would randomize patients to active therapy at one of two
      doses (25 and 75 million MPCs) versus placebo, and based on a predetermined selection
      criterion drop randomization to one of the dose arms as results accrue. Should this
      exploratory trial demonstrate safety but no signal of efficacy, then the subsequent trial
      would be based on a single dose of 75 million MPCs versus placebo.

    <description>The primary safety endpoint of this study is the incidence of the following potential study-intervention related adverse events within 90 days post intervention (LVAD implantation + intramyocardial injection of study product): infectious myocarditis, myocardial rupture, neoplasm, hypersensitivity reaction, and immune sensitization.</description>

    <measure>Functional Status and Ventricular Function</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The key efficacy endpoint of this study is functional status and ventricular function, while weaned from LVAD support, at 90 days post intervention (LVAD implantation + intramyocardial injection of study product). Functional status is defined by the ability to tolerate wean from LVAD support for 30 minutes without signs or symptoms of hypoperfusion, including, but not limited to symptoms of low output or signs of vascular congestion. Ventricular function will be assessed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in those patients able to be weaned for 30 minutes from LVAD support.
The number of participants who successfully tolerated the 30 minute wean from LVAD support at 90 days is reported.</description>

        <description>The key efficacy endpoint of this study is functional status and ventricular function, while weaned from LVAD support, at 90 days post intervention (LVAD implantation + intramyocardial injection of study product). Functional status is defined by the ability to tolerate wean from LVAD support for 30 minutes without signs or symptoms of hypoperfusion, including, but not limited to symptoms of low output or signs of vascular congestion. Ventricular function will be assessed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in those patients able to be weaned for 30 minutes from LVAD support.
The number of participants who successfully tolerated the 30 minute wean from LVAD support at 90 days is reported.</description>
