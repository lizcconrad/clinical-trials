  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study PIM4973g is a multicenter, international, open-label Phase II trial. Participants with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed on or after VEGF targeted therapy will be
      randomized in 1:1 to two groups either to receive daily GDC-0980 or everolimus orally.
