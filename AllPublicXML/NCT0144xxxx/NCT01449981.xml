    <textblock>
      This study is the first to develop and test in a randomized experimental design the efficacy
      of an integrated 12-step facilitation intervention tailored for young people. In the first
      phase of the study, the investigators are developing and revising a preliminary manual for
      the two sessions individually-delivered Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) component and
      subsequent 8 session group-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) component which will
      integrate Twelve-step Facilitation (TSF). Forty adolescents each will complete the
      preliminary integrated TSF protocol. In the second phase of the study, the investigators will
      compare integrated TSF (iTSF) to standard treatment (MET/CBT) in a randomized experimental
      design for adolescent substance use disorder with 60 adolescents. As a result, the
      investigators will examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of iTSF in
      improving alcohol and other drug use outcomes. The investigators will test group differences
      on potential mechanisms of change (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous attendance
      and involvement) and whether these variables are associated with substance use outcomes.

    <description>Given the goals of both treatments will be abstinence, the main outcome analyses and effect size estimates will be based upon biochemically verified 90 day point-prevalence of PDA. These will be captured using Form-90 (Miller &amp; Del Boca, 1994) which will be used to examine substance use (including number of days used and first and last dates of use within the time period), as well as other treatment experiences in the past 90 days.</description>

    <description>The iTSF condition will include review of treatment goals and overall review of progress, coping skills, real life practices, emotions/mood management, how to make changes in one's social network and discussions about how 12-step meetings can be helpful in one's recovery efforts. In addition, speakers from 12-step fellowships such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) will be invited to share their experiences and discuss myths and facts related to attendance at 12-step meetings as well as answer any questions participants have about these fellowships.</description>
