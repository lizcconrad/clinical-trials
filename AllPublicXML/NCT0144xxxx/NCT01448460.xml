    <textblock>
      Vitrification is a method of cryopreserving tissue for future use. It is widely used to
      preserve extra, good quality embryos generated from infertility treatments. It is becoming
      popular for the preservation of oocytes (eggs) as well, but is still considered
      investigational in this respect. The purpose of this study is to provide egg freezing for
      patients desiring fertility preservation. Although commonly used in clinics around the world,
      it should be offered as an IRB approved study procedure until it is no longer considered
      investigational by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.

        IVF patients who desire to have extra eggs, in excess of what is needed for their IVF
        cycle, or subjects requesting fertility preservation due to fertility threatening
        conditions such as cancer, advanced age or other.

             between 20 and 32kg/m2. If they do consent, eggs will only be vitrified if 13 or more
             mature metaphase II oocytes are collected.

          -  Women between the ages of 14 and 42 who are seeking treatment for fertility
             preservation. In addition they must also meet the following criteria.

          -  Have functioning ovaries as determined by blood / ultrasound testing.

          -  Patient is willing to undergo infectious disease testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C,
             syphilis, gonorrhea and Chlamydia.

          -  The patient must have clearance from their oncologist or medical specialist, if any,
             to undergo ovarian stimulation and transvaginal oocyte retrieval.

          -  The patient must not have a past history of blood clots in the veins or in the lungs.

          -  The patient must be willing to undergo transvaginal, internal ultrasound examination
             and pelvic examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a cycle day 3 FSH &gt; 10 mIU/ml, cycle day 3 estradiol &gt; 70 pg/ml and a
             baseline follicle count &lt; 10 will be excluded.

          -  Patients with a BMI &lt;20 and &gt;32 will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are not willing or are unable to meet the above mentioned eligibility
             requirments.

          -  Patients with expected low ovarian reserve [evaluated on day 3 by an antral follicle
             count of &lt;3 follicles at 2-5 mm diameter and/or an increased concentration of follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;15 IU [15] on cycle day 3 ].

          -  Patients with possible poor quality of oocytes, based on medical history including
             previous exposure to chemotherapeutics or radiation.
