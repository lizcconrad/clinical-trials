      The purpose of this study is to assess the yield of combination modalities in the diagnosis
      of pancreatic cysts using EUS/FNA, Fiber optics (direct visualization probe), and prototype
      needle based confocal laser-induced endomicroscopy miniprobe (nCLE).

    <description>Patients will undergo the EUS-FNA procedure, as per standard of care, plus an additional direct visualization (fiber optic probe) and nCLE procedure with the prototype probes, which will add 10 minutes maximum to the EUS-FNA procedure.
The probes will be positioned against the lining of the pancreatic cyst, and images will be acquired. After imaging, fine needle aspiration of the lesion will be performed, as usual.</description>
