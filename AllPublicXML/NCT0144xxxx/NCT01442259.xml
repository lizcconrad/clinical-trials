             the study.

        For subjects with renal impairment only

          -  No current clinically significant disease (other than renal impairment), except for
             stable underlying disease that caused renal impairment, as determined by clinical
             history and physical examination.

          -  MDRD-calculated eGFR of &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on serum creatinine

          -  Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting measured in the supine position) should be within
             normal ranges as deemed by the Investigator.

        For healthy subjects only

          -  No current clinically significant disease as determined by clinical history and
             physical examination.

          -  MDRD-calculated eGFR of ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on serum creatinine.

             or 3rd degree AV-block or any other clinically significant ECG abnormalities as
             determined by medical history and 12-lead ECG recordings at screening and baseline 1.

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ
             class, within the past 2 years prior to screening, except for renal impairment and
             underlying diseases causing renal impairment for the subject belonging to the renal
             impairment groups.

          -  Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis)

          -  History of or ongoing active substance abuse (including alcohol) within the past 2
             years.

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will
             be measured during Screening and at Baseline for all subjects. Smokers will be defined
             as any subject who reports tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL at
             screening
