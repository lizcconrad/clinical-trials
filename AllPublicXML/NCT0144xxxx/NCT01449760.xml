  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and in particular sport is beneficial to health. Nevertheless, some of
      these activities may create a risk of injury. Ankle sprain is the most common sport related
      injury. Sports that are causing the highest number of ankle sprains are: football (30%),
      handball-basketball-volleyball-rugby (24%), gymnastics sports (6%), skiing (6%), cycling
      (6%), athletics (4%) and contact sports (4%). A recent study in the Netherlands identified a
      total of 1.3 million sports injuries. 47% of these patients required medical care. The total
      costs (direct and indirect) were assessed 84.240.000 EUR per year.

      Prospective studies demonstrated that athletes with a ankle sprain have a twofold risk of
      re-injury during the first year after the trauma, and in half of patients with an ankle
      sprain recurrence this could lead to instability or chronic pain of the ankle.

      The Wii Balance Board 速 is a tool that is increasingly used in the field of health. In some
      hospitals, therapists are beginning to use it for the rehabilitation of patients after
      surgery, fractures or strokes.

      Patients are asked to complete their physical therapy session by practicing &quot;sports&quot; via
      video games such as skiing, bowling or hula hoop. Currently, there are no randomized
      controlled studies that publish on the effectiveness of this tool. Recently, a study
      investigated the efficacy of the Wii Balance Board 速 to improve balance, strength, joint
      mobility and level of physical activity. After 10 weeks of training, people an increased
      strength and balance was found. However, these results still require statistical
      confirmation. Thus this objectives of this study are

        -  To assess the efficacy of exercise training with the Wii Balance Board 速 Platform

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy (based on current guidelines)

        -  To compare these two types of care (conventional physiotherapy versus Wii) to a control
           group (non-treatment).
