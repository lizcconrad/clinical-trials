  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab in two cohorts. The first cohort (reported separately under FVF3426g,
      NCT00379795) enrolled subjects with primary or recurrent Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)
      secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) who completed the treatment phase of a
      Genentech sponsored study (FVF2598g (NCT00056836), FVF2587g (NCT00061594), or FVF2428g
      (NCT00056823)). The second cohort (reported here) enrolled subjects with macular edema
      secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) who completed the 6-month treatment and 6-month
      observation phases (12 months total) of a Genentech sponsored study (FVF4165g (NCT00486018)
      or FVF4166g (NCT00485836)). Patients were enrolled within 14 days of completion of the
      previous study.

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with: any ocular adverse events, ocular adverse events causing treatment discontinuation, ocular serious adverse events, intraocular inflammation and cataracts that occurred in the study eye.
Only adverse events that occurred during this extension study are reported. For subjects in the crossover groups who started their first ranibizumab injection in this extension study, adverse events that occurred prior to any ranibizumab injection were also excluded.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Non-ocular Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with non-ocular adverse events (not occurring in the eye) in the following categories: any adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation and death.
Only adverse events that occurred during this extension study are reported. For subjects in the crossover groups who started their first ranibizumab injection in this extension study, adverse events that occurred prior to any ranibizumab injection were also excluded.
Additional information about adverse events can be found in the adverse events section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 of extension study), Months 6, 12, 18, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in then BCVA was assessed by the number of letters a patient could read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Eye Chart at a Starting Test Distance of 4 Meters. An increase in the number of letters read indicates improvement in visual acuity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Foveal Thickness at Month 6 and Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 of extension study), Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Central foveal (retinal) thickness was assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT was conducted at the study sites by personnel who were certified by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Function Composite Score, as Measured by the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 of extension study), Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>NEI VFQ-25 is a 25 item questionnaire that assesses visual function and quality of life for a total possible score of 0 to 100. A higher score represents better functioning. The change from baseline is calculated at Month 12 and Month 24.
Participants are grouped according to the treatment they received in initial studies FVF4165g BRAVO (NCT00486018) and FVF4166g CRUISE (NCT00485836).</description>
