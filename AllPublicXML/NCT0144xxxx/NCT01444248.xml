      The effectiveness of treatment of a disease depends mainly on two factors: the efficacy of
      the treatment and the compliance of the patient with this treatment. Polymedication is one of
      the predisposing factors to low compliance in type 2 DM. It can be expected that a simple
      regimen may improve compliance. Amaryl Mex phase III trial was not designed to compare the
      compliance of patients with different dosing regimens of oral antidiabetic drugs. However, it
      was found that patients' compliance in the morning was better than in the evening, suggesting
      that Amaryl Mex once daily regimen may improve compliance. Pill count is the gold standard
      for measuring compliance, but this method provides incomplete and unreliable results.
      Advanced electronic monitoring device obtains details of patients' behavior during the day
      and over long periods.
