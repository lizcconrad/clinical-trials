  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will examine the effects of consuming a structured, portion-controlled,
      low-glycemic index diet (commercially available as the Nutrisystem-D program) on several
      indicators of glycemic stability and variability among participants with type 2 diabetes.
      Results on the portion-controlled diet will be compared with those on participants' usual
      diets in a randomized cross-over trial. The investigators expect that participants will
      exhibit greater glycemic stability (e.g., more time in euglycemic range) and less glycemic
      variability (e.g., smaller mean amplitude of glycemic excursions) while consuming the
      Nutrisystem D program, as compared with their usual diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate glycemic stability and variability in response to two diets:
      usual diet and a commercially available portion-controlled diet. The commercially available
      diet will be the Nutrisystem-D program, which consists of pre-packaged meals and snacks that
      are supplemented with grocery items, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy items. This
      trial will be a randomized cross-over trial of 15 patients with type 2 diabetes (weight
      stable for at least 3 months prior and medication stable throughout the trial). Participants
      will consume each diet for a 2-week period. During each diet period, participants will wear a
      blinded (i.e., providing no feedback) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to assess
      glycemic stability and variability, and will be instructed to keep a detailed record of food
      and beverage intake and physical activity. The two diet/assessment periods will be separated
      by a 1-week washout period during which no dietary instruction will be given and no outcomes
      will be measured. Laboratory values (HbA1c, glucose, insulin, lipid panel) and physical
      measures (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure) will be assessed at the
      baseline for descriptive purposes.

      Primary Hypothesis: A significantly greater percentage of CGM readings will fall in the
      euglycemic range (71-180 mg/dl) during consumption of the Nutrisystem-D program, as compared
      with Usual Diet.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Participants will have significantly smaller areas under the curve,
      mean amplitude of glycemic excurisions, mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range of
      glucose values, and a smaller of percentage of values in the hypo- (&lt;/= 70 mg/dl) and
      hyperglycemic (&gt;180 mg/dl) ranges during consumption of the Nutrisystem-D program, as
      compared with Usual Diet.

    <description>Euglycemia will be defined as a CGM reading in the range of 71-180 mg/dl, inclusive. Percent of time in the euglycemic range each day is automatically generated by the software accompanying the CGM device. Daily values will be averaged over each of the 2-week assessment periods (i.e. during consumption of Usual Diet or Nutrisystem-D program).</description>

    <description>During this diet period, participants will consume portion-controlled products from the Nutrisystem-D program for three entrees and one (women) or two (men) snacks per day. These pre-packaged portion-controlled items will be supplemented with grocery additions (fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy items) to provide approximately 1300 (women) to 1500 (men) calories per day. The Nutrisystem-D program (i.e., provided foods plus grocery additions) provides approximately 53% of calories from carbohydrate, 22% of calories from fat (6% from saturated fat and 0% from trans fat), and 25% of calories from protein. Women and men on the program consume approximately 1800 and 2000 mg/d, respectively, of sodium, and 31 and 35 g/d, respectively, of fiber.</description>
