    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of an online computer program,
      called OxIGen (Oxford Imagery Generation), on thinking style and mood in depression. The
      OxIGen program will be delivered online over four weeks and with follow-up at one, three and
      six months. This will inform potential future development of this computerized task into an
      online intervention to modify negative thinking styles in depression.
