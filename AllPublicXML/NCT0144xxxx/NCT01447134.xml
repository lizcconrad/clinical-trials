      1. Primary endpoint(s): To determine the relationship between the drug distribution and
           angiogenesis in head and neck cancer patients.

        2. Secondary endpoint(s): To expand the safety database of [F-18]RGD-K5 and to correlate
           the parameters from the image study to clinical treatment response and prognosis.

      This is an uncontrolled, open-labeled, non-randomized, prospective study. The study duration
      is expected to be completed in a period of 3 year. Up to 100 patients would be included.
      Group A would be those to undergo surgical excision or biopsy (n=20); Group B would be those
      with N2c-3M0 disease to receive chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n=40);
      and Group C would be those with M1 disease to receive biotherapy or chemotherapy (n=40).
      Group A patients could be included into Group B or C if qualified. Each participant must
      fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
