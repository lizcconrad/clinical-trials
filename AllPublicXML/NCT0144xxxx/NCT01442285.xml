    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in the feasibility of using computer assisted screening and
      assessment to meet the psychosocial needs of people with cancer. The investigators are
      studying two different interventions. Both groups will receive health information, referral
      information, and resources. One group will also receive tailored feedback reports.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in psychological stress</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Both groups will receive a full assessment, referral information, and resources. Only the intervention group will have the option of immediately sending their contact information to a counselor/mental health provider and receive a tailored feedback report with specific recommendations about managing their psychological and social needs, and provide education about ways to improve their quality of life. We anticipate that distressed subjects assigned to the Intervention Group will exhibit larger decreases in psychological distress when compared against the Control Group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduced distress</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reduced distress will be achieved through initiation of mental health counseling, psychotropic medications, and psychosocial support group participation in distressed patients who are not currently receiving mental health treatment at baseline, and enhancement of existing mental health treatment in patients already receiving some form of mental health treatment at baseline, including adding another treatment modality, such as psychotherapy being added to a medication regimen, or adjusting their existing mental health treatments, such as increasing the dose of an anti-depressant.</description>
