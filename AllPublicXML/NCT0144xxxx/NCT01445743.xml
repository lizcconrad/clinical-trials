    <textblock>
      That is a double-blind randomized trial with parallel control to demonstrate the safety and
      immunogenicity of acellular Tdap vaccine in pregnant mexican women. The general objective is
      to determine the safety and immunogenicity of acellular Tdap vaccine.

      The experimental group will receive acellular Tdap vaccine and the control group will receive
      a placebo consisting of saline 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution, randomly assigned, which will
      be administered by the same route (intramuscular) and at the same dose (0.5 ml) that the
      vaccine.

      Type of Study: Clinical, randomized, double-blind, parallel control study. Study Subjects:
      Pregnant women of 19-38years of age, gestational age of 12-24 weeks, low risk of obstetric
      complications (according to the Obstetric Risk Assessment Form), normal anatomic ultrasound
      performed in the second quarter of pregnancy and residence in Guadalupe, and Juarez cities in
      Nuevo Leon State.

      The experimental group will receive acellular Tdap vaccine and the control group will receive
      a placebo consisting of saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride) solution, randomly assigned, which will
      be administered by the same route (intramuscular) and at the same dose (0.5 ml) that the
      vaccine by trained personnel.

      For both groups, 6 blood samples will be taken. Women: Before and at least 4 weeks after the
      vaccine or placebo were administered, at hospital admission for delivery. Infant: collected
      at delivery (cord), 2, 4 and 6 months of age.

      Immunogenicity will be compared in both groups by measuring the increase of three of the
      following antigen-specific antibodies: Pertussis toxin (PT), pertactin (PRN),and fimbriae 2
      FIM 2).

      Safety Assessment: Each pregnant will be observed at 30 minutes, 24 and 48 hours and one
      month after the application of the vaccine for side effects.
