  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational study will be performed in subjects aged 3-65 years old to describe the
      dynamic changes of cellular immunity after vaccination of hepatitis B vaccine, and to find
      out the expression levels of Th9 cells and IL9 in subjects with different response to the
      primary immunization (3 single -dose injunctions).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study selected 74 volunteers which had the hepatitis B vaccine (immunization programs
      0,1,6) , anti-HBs≤10mIU as the research subjects, and choose 20 volunteers which
      anti-HBs≥1000mIU as the control group, revaccination the groups according to the normal
      immunization programs, then the blood samples would be collected at 7th day, separate the
      PBMC and detect the expression levels of Th9 cells and IL9 by FCM, trying to find out the
      effects of Th9 and IL9 of non/poor -responsiveness subjects to hepatitis B.
