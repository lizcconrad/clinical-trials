  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overaccumulation of apoB-48-containing lipoproteins of intestinal origin seen in patients
      with type 2 diabetes are now thought to be attributable to elevated intestinal production and
      reduced clearance. Substantial evidence exists indicating that elevated plasma levels of
      these lipoproteins are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore,
      reduction of atherogenic plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) levels of intestinal
      origin appears to be crucial to improve CVD risk associated with type 2 diabetes. In this
      regard, n-3 PUFAs have been shown to exert beneficial effects on diabetic dyslipidemia.
      However, the investigators understanding of the physiological changes that occur with n-3
      PUFA supplementation is suboptimal, thereby limiting the investigators appreciation of its
      impact on CVD risk associated with type 2 diabetes. The effects of n-3 PUFAs on the
      intestinal production of TRLs and the expression of genes regulating intestinal lipid
      absorption and chylomicron synthesis have not yet been examined in humans. The general
      objective of the proposed research is to investigate the mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs
      beneficially modify intestinal lipoprotein metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes. The
      investigators hypothesize that n-3 PUFA supplementation in men with type 2 diabetes will:

        -  reduce TRL apoB-48 production rate and increase fractional catabolic rate of these
           lipoproteins,

        -  decrease the expression of genes that regulate intestinal lipid absorption and synthesis
           as well as synthesis of apoB-48-containing lipoproteins,

        -  decrease both plasma surrogates of cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis.
