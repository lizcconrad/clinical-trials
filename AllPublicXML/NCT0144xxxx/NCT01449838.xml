  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study protocol for a single centre, randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled, single and repeat dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of intravenous dosing of Colistin Methanesulfonate Sodium (CMS-Na) in
      healthy Japanese male subjects.

      Eighteen subjects will receive CMS-Na 2.5mg/kg (as colistin activity or 75,000 IU/kg) or
      placebo as a single dose and twice daily for 2.5 days by intravenous infusion.

      Blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetics analysis will be taken at regular intervals
      after dosing. Safety will be assessed by measurement of vital signs, Echocardiogram (ECGs),
      safety laboratory data, renal function and review of adverse events.

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             Japanese grandparents, holding a Japanese passport or identity papers and being able

             &lt;35%).

          7. Subjects with no clinically significant value of CLcr, NAG and beta-2 microglobulin

         11. A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject

         12. The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

         13. Able to complete all study procedures and planned treatment periods. &lt;Exclusion
             Criteria&gt;

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates and
             benzodiazepines. The detection of drugs with a legitimate medical use would not
             necessarily be an exclusion to study participation.

          2. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          3. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          4. A positive test for HIV antibody.

          5. History of regular alcohol consumption within 3months of the study defined as:

             an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of
             greater than 3 units. One unit is equivalent to a 285 mL glass of full strength beer
             or 425 mL schooner of light beer or 1 (30 mL) measure of spirits or 1 glass (100 mL)

             dosing day.

          8. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

         10. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

         11. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

         12. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products prior to screening.

         13. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to colistin or derived components.

         14. Subject is kept under regulatory of judicial order in an institution.

         15. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

         16. The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140 mmHg or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90 mmHg.

         17. Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

        &lt;Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations&gt; To assess any potential impact on subject
        eligibility with regard to safety, the investigator must refer to the Prescribing
        Information (see Appendix 2, 3 and 4) for detailed information regarding warnings,
        precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other significant data pertaining to
        the investigational product being used in this study.
