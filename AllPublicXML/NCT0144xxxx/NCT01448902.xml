    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy of OC000459 200 mg twice daily orally in comparison to
      placebo when subjects are challenged in the Vienna Challenge Chamber for 6 hours. This is a
      randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, two way crossover evaluation. There will be a
      screening period of up to three weeks and a washout period of at least one week between the
      two treatment periods. There will be a follow up one to three weeks after the last dose of
      study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males aged 18 to 50 years with a history of symptoms of grass pollen related allergic
             rhinitis within the previous two years.

          -  Subjects must be free from significant cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             renal, haematological, neurological and psychiatric disease as determined by history,
             physical examination and screening investigations.

          -  FEV1 within normal limits (â‰¥90% of predicted).

          -  Atopy defined by a positive cutaneous response to mixed grass pollen within the last
             12 months or at screening.

          -  Asymptomatic at screening

          -  Non smokers for at least the past 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical conditions likely to affect the outcome of the study.

          -  Nasal conditions likely to affect the outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal
             perforations, nasal polyps, sinus disease, chronic nasal obstruction, or other nasal
             diseases.

          -  Presence of any respiratory disease other than a history of mild stable asthma not
