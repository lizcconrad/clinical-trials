      Further study details as provided by Duke University:

      Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of collecting and infusing autologous
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) in newborn infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).

      Study Rationale and Hypotheses: The major goal of this study is to determine whether infusion
      of autologous UCB cells in neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome is feasible and
      safe. The rationale for the study and for the potential benefit of UCB is based upon the
      following hypotheses:

        1. Infants with HLHS have significant neural injury evidenced from both prenatal and early
           antenatal brain MRI findings and infusion of UCB cells may lessen neural injury.
           Although the exact mechanism is unknown, UCB cell infusion may ameliorate neural injury
           via paracrine and anti-inflammatory effects that enhance post injury repair and may
           promote endogenous functional compensation of other cortical areas resulting in
           significant clinical improvements.

        2. UCB cells may also enhance cardiac function, minimize scar formation, and reverse
           detrimental remodeling after cardiac injury.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusions of
      autologous (the patient's own)umbilical cord blood cells in neonates with hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome. This is a prospective, randomized Phase I trial designed to assess the safety
      and feasibility of autologous UCB reinfusion in neonates with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
      (HLHS). Neonates who are identified prenatally as having a cardiac lesion consistent with
      HLHS will be referred to Duke Cardiology for further evaluation. If they meet inclusion
      criteria, UCB will be collected at the time of delivery and processed (red blood cell- and
      volume-reduced) for reinfusion. All enrolled infants will receive a dose of fresh UCB cells
      pre-operatively and Â½ of the enrolled infants will be randomly selected to receive a second
      dose of frozen and thawed UCB cells after stage 1 palliation (5-35 days post-operatively) and
      a third dose of frozen and thawed UCB cells 2 to 4 weeks after the 2nd infusion.
      Neurodevelopmental outcome measures will be assessed at 1 month after discharge, at 4-6
      months old and 12 months. The results of MRI's and echocardiograms that are obtained per
      clinical routine will be analyzed and described in study reports.
