  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses (AKs) are some of the most common lesions seen by dermatologists. Flesh
      colored to erythematous, these lesions often present with scaling or crusting in sun damaged
      regions of the body. While they are physically visible and often palpable, these changes can
      also result in psychosocial changes in patients, including embarrassment about their skin or
      reduction in leisure activities to avoid further sun exposure. At the same time, AKs are
      known to progress in a significant number of cases to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a
      concern in terms of its metastatic potential.

      The primary purpose of developing this questionnaire is to examine how well it can
      potentially identify patients with actinic keratoses. However, since AK is associated with
      significant detriment to quality of life for validity/reliability assessment, the
      investigators propose to give a compilation of four self-assessment questionnaires (not
      specific to AK but validated for skin health in general) to subjects with at least one
      actinic keratosis and age- and sex- matched participants without AKs, defined as the control
      population. These will include the SKINDEX-16, the DLQI and the Skin Health Calculator, as
      well as a questionnaire composed of items specific to predisposition to AKs to be able to
      better assess the discriminatory power of the questionnaire.
