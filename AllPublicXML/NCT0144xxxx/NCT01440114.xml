  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is a common self limiting problem after emerging from general
      anesthesia (GA) especially in pediatric patients. The incidence of EA in Thai population, the
      incidences of EA 43.2% in pediatric patients aged between 2-9 years. There have been many
      studies tried to reduce the incidence of EA in various ways such as Preoperative anxiety
      reduction method and medication. Premedication, Sedative drugs and narcotic drugs were used
      to reduce the incidence of EA.
