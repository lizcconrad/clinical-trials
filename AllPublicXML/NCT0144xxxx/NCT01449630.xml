    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of LY3031207 in healthy subjects. The purposes of this study are to
      look at safety, how well the study drug is tolerated, and how much of the study drug gets
      into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to humans.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. Subjects will
      participate in the study for approximately 3 months. This study is for research purposes only
      and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
