  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With discovery of KIT mutations and the advent of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib
      (GlivecTM, Novartis), there has been substantial improvement in overall survival in patients
      with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (GIST). Recently, sunitinib
      (SuteneTM, Pfizer) showed activity as second-line therapy in GIST patients after failure with
      imatinib. However, virtually all patients will eventually progress or become intolerable
      after the first-line imatinib and the second-line sunitinib. Dovitinib (TKI258, Novartis) is
      a multi-kinase inhibitor. TKI258 is a potent inhibitor of the VEGFR 1, 2, and 3, FGFR1, 2 and
      3, PDGFRβ, Kit, RET, TrkA, CSF 1R, and FLT3 with inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50s) of less
      than 40nM. Stem cell factor (SCF) also termed KIT ligand, or steel factor has been shown to
      modulate tumor angiogenesis. In cultured human endothelial cells and Kit expressing cancer
      cells, TKI258 inhibits VEGF- and SCF-stimulated mitogenesis. .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that KIT and PDGFR which can be inhibited by TKI258 have a crucial role in
      the development and proliferation of GIST, and in general FGFR has an important role in
      angiogenesis and tumor proliferation in many cancers. We assume that TKI258 can be also
      effective in patients with GIST. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      activity of TKI258 given as salvage treatment for GIST after failure to standard imatinib and
      sunitinib.

    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the first treatment to the onset of progressive disease per RECIST criteria or to the date of death whichever comes first. For patients who do not experience progressive disease or death, the progression-free survival duration will be right censored on the last disease assessment date.
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions</description>
