    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies how well dasatinib works together with paclitaxel and
      carboplatin in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or endometrial cancer that has
      come back after a period of improvement. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving dasatinib together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pMEK and EphA2 signaling effectors in pre- and post- treatment biopsy tissues
      from patients with advanced staged measurable primary or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v. 4) of dasatinib administered in
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced staged measurable
      primary or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      II. To record the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) v.1.1.

      III. To describe the progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the relationship of micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) 520d-3p (miR520d-3p) and EphA2
      in pretreatment biopsies.

      II. To evaluate downstream EphA2 signaling effectors, such as CAV-1, pAKT, FAK, paxillin, and
      p130cas in pre- and post-tissue treatment biopsies.

      III. To explore the effect of dasatinib on the expression of other Eph family members such as
      EphB2 and EphB4.

      IV. To quantify circulating tumor cells (CTCs) before and during the individual treatment
      phases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14
      days. *Beginning 7 days later, patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours
      and carboplatin IV on day 1, and dasatinib PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: * Patients who have had prior external-beam pelvic or extended-field pelvic/para-aortic
      radiation therapy must receive treatment at a reduced dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have measurable stage III, stage IV, or recurrent endometrial carcinoma
             whose potential for cure by surgery or radiation therapy alone is poor

          -  Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible:
             endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear
             cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise
             specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, transitional cell
             carcinoma, and mesonephric carcinoma; uterine carcinosarcoma are not eligible for
             either COHORT

          -  All patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as at least
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
             dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 20 mm when measured by conventional
             techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI), or &gt;= 10 mm when measured by spiral CT; measurable disease
             lesions must be amenable to pre- and post- treatment biopsy

          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation
             therapy

          -  Patients must have a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status of 0 to 2

          -  Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy

          -  Patients should have had NO prior chemotherapy agents for advanced or recurrent
             endometrial cancer; prior chemotherapy administration in conjunction with primary
             radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer would not exclude a patient from participation
             in this trial

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL, equivalent to

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation is not contraindicated, but for those patients on
             therapeutic anticoagulation, alteration in coagulation parameters is expected
             following initiation of dasatinib; for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation,
             coagulation parameters should be assessed weekly for the first cycle following
             initiation of dasatinib, weekly for the first cycle following a dose reduction, and
             weekly for a minimum of two weeks after stopping dasatinib

          -  Warfarin is permitted for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis; Note: low-molecular
             weight heparin is permitted provided the patient's prothrombin time (PT)/international
             normalized ratio (INR) is =&lt; 1.5; for patients on anticoagulation, coagulation
             parameters should be assessed weekly for the first cycle following initiation of

             minimum of two weeks after stopping dasatinib

          -  PT such that INR is =&lt; 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient
             is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
             =&lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal; patients receiving low-molecular
             weight heparin for the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolic disease are
             eligible if considered clinically stable on their regimen

          -  Oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 88% on room air (CTCAE 4 &lt; grade 2)

          -  Patients must have a baseline electrocardiogram (EKG) performed prior to enrolling on
             study; the EKG must have corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt; 450 msec and must not show
             evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
             fibrillation must be less than 3 beats in a row)

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction must be within the institutional range of normal as measured
             by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) testing; note that baseline and on
             treatment scans should be performed using the same modality and preferably at the same

             for at least 6 months after receiving the final treatment of dasatinib

          -  Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets

          -  Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the
             following:

               -  Myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months

               -  Prolonged QTc &gt;= 480 msec (Fridericia correction)

               -  Ejection fraction less than institutional normal

               -  Major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present)

               -  Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g. shortness of
                  breath, chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with
                  or without stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule
                  out QTc prolongation; the patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the
                  discretion of the principal investigator; patients with underlying

          -  Patients may not be receiving any prohibited potent cytochrome P450, family 3,
             subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors; for these drugs, a washout period of
             greater than or equal to 7 days is required prior to starting dasatinib treatment

          -  The concomitant use of histamine (H2) blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPI's) with
             dasatinib is not recommended (e.g., famotidine, omeprazole); the use of antacids
