      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate administered
      as a once monthly injection in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.

      This is an open-label (patients and study staff will know the identity of treatments
      assigned) study of paliperidone palmitate in patients with acute an exacerbation of
      schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 4 months. Eligible
      patients without a documented history of exposure to oral risperidone or paliperidone
      extended-release (ER), or intramuscular (IM) RISPERDAL CONSTA or paliperidone palmitate will
      receive oral risperidone 1 mg/day or extended release (ER) OROS paliperidone 3 mg/day for at
      least 3 days before the first injection of the study drug (paliperidone palmitate) for
      tolerability testing. Paliperidone palmitate will be administered to patients as an
      intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid (upper arm) or gluteal (buttocks) muscle.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia will be assessed using the 30-item PANSS, which provides a total score (sum of the scores of all 30 items) and scores for 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Each question is rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in global severity of illness using the clinical global impression - severity (CGI-S) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, the patient will be assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating between 1 (not ill) and 7 (extremely severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the personal and social performance scale (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of dysfunction a patient exhibits over a 7-day period within 4 domains of behavior:(a) socially useful activities, (b) personal and social relationships, (c) self-care, and (d) disturbing and aggressive behavior. A score between 71 and 100 indicates only mild difficulties, and one between 31 and 70 indicates varying degrees of disability. A patient with a score of 30 or less has functioning so poor he or she requires intensive support or supervision..</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination and vital signs at Screening
             (Baseline) and have a current diagnosis of schizophrenia according to Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for at least 1 year
             before screening and no longer than 5 years (early diagnosed patients)

          -  Have acute exacerbation of psychosis defined as: less than 4 weeks but more than 4
             days, PANSS total score of 70 to 120 (inclusive) at screening (moderate
             symptomatology), a score of 4 or more (at least moderately ill) at screening on the
             severity scale of the CGI-S

          -  If a woman, before entry she must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically
             sterile or abstinent. If sexually active, agree to practice an effective method of
             birth control before entry and throughout the study as specified in the protocol; If a
             man is heterosexually active with a woman of childbearing potential, he must agree to
             use a double-barrier method of birth control and to not donate sperm during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, endocrine, metabolic or pulmonary disease in the past
             6 months (as determined by medical history, clinical laboratory or electrocardiogram
             [ECG] results, or physical examination) that would increase the risk associated with
             taking study medication or would confound the interpretation of the study

          -  The psychiatric diagnosis is due to direct pharmacological effects of a substance (eg,
             a drug of abuse or medication) or a general medical condition (eg, clinically notable
             hypothyroidism, delirium)

          -  Meets the DSM-IV definition of substance dependence (except for nicotine and caffeine)
             within 6 months prior to entry

          -  Has history or current symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (involuntary repetitive body
             movements)

          -  Has history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome
