  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it is frequently mentioned in the media that overweight and obesity have reached
      epidemic proportions worldwide and in this country, some Canadians are perplexed and
      sometimes confused about the role of obesity in diabetes and heart disease. In fact, the
      investigators even hear from time to time that there could be &quot;healthy&quot; obese individuals. In
      clinical practice, assessment of obesity as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      remains a challenge as even some physicians are confused. However, studies conducted in our
      laboratory and by other research teams around the world over the last 20 years have clearly
      shown that body shape is more important than body size when evaluating the risk of
      overweight/obesity and that high accumulation of abdominal fat (excess belly fat) increases
      the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

      The investigators now need to better understand the link between excess belly fat and
      atherosclerosis (the thickening of artery walls by fatty deposits, also referred to as
      atherosclerotic plaque), leading to complications such as angina (chest pain) and myocardial
      infarction (heart attacks). Using non-invasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance
      imaging, the investigators therefore propose to examine the relationships between measures of
      fatness and of abdominal fat and the size of atherosclerotic plaque in large blood vessels of
      apparently healthy human subjects. This study is also a unique opportunity to look, for the
      first time, at the relationship between belly fat, blood sugar, several well-known risk
      factors for heart disease (cholesterol, blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, etc.) and
      the size of atherosclerotic plaques. This research program should pave the way to the
      development of new improved preventive/therapeutic approaches focusing not on body weight but
      rather on abdominal fat and associated blood abnormalities which are predictive of the
      development of atherosclerotic plaques leading to the premature development of heart disease.
