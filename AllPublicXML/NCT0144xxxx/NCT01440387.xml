    <measure>Humoral Immune Response in Terms of Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against Each of the 4 Vaccine Influenza Strains.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody titres were expressed as Geometric mean titers (GMTs). The vaccine strains assessed were Flu B/Florida/4/06 (Yamagata), FluB/Bri/60/08 (Victoria), Flu A/CAL/7/09 (H1N1) and Flu A/Victoria/210/09 (H3N2) antigens.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Were Seroprotected for HI Antibodies Against Each of the 4 Vaccine Influenza Strains.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A seroprotected subject was defined as a subject with a serum HI titer greater than or equal to 1:40 that usually is accepted as indicating protection. The vaccine strains assessed were Yamagata, Victoria, H1N1 and H3N2 antigens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Seroconverted Subjects for HI Antibodies Against Each of the 4 Vaccine Influenza Strains.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer less than (&lt;) 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40, or a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The vaccine strains assessed were Yamagata, Victoria, H1N1 and H3N2 antigens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HI Antibody Seroconversion Factors (SCFs) Against Each of the 4 Vaccine Influenza Strains.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>SCFs were defined as the fold increase in serum HI GMTs post-vaccination compared to Day 0. The vaccine strains assessed were Yamagata, Victoria, H1N1 and H3N2 antigens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Days 0-3) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any was defined as any solicited local symptom reported irrespective of intensity. Grade 3 pain was defined as pain that prevented normal everyday activities. Grade 3 redness and swelling were defined as redness/swelling greater than 100 millimeters (mm). i.e. &gt;100mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Days 0-3) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were chest tightness, chills, cough, fatigue, headache, joint pain at other location, muscle pain, red eyes, sore throat, swelling of the face and fever [oral temperature ≥ 38.0 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = any solicited general symptom reported irrespective of intensity and relationship to vaccination. Related = symptoms considered by the investigator to have a causal relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = oral temperature above 39.0°C</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 21-day (Days 0-20) post-vaccination period.</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE was defined as any AE (i.e. any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (Day 0 - Day 20 after vaccination).</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject

          -  Male and female adults, 18 years of age and older in stable health as determined by
             investigator's clinical examination and assessment of subjects' medical history.
