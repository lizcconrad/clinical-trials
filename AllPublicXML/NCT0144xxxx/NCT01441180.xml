    <textblock>
      Background:

      - GS-7977 is a new drug that is being developed to treat hepatitis C infection. It works by
      blocking the hepatitis C virus from dividing in the body. This medication has been used along
      with other medications commonly used to treat hepatitis C, such as interferon and ribavirin.
      When used with interferon and ribavirin, GS-7977 seems to be very effective in eliminating
      the hepatitis C virus from the body. However, interferon can have serious side effects, so
      researchers want to see if GS-7977 can work by itself or with only ribavirin.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of GS-7977 alone or given with ribavirin for hepatitis
      C infection.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have hepatitis C with liver disease, and have
      never received drugs for it.

      Design:

        -  This study will require multiple clinic visits over 18 months. A liver biopsy will be
           required before the start of the study if participants have not had one within the past
           3 years.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

        -  Participants will have either GS-7977 alone or GS-7977 with ribavirin. GS-7977 is taken
           by mouth once a day. Ribavirin is taken by mouth in the morning and evening.

        -  Participants will have study visits on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. These visits will
           involve regular blood tests and symptom monitoring.

        -  After the second week, participants will have study visits during Weeks 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
           16, and 20. Blood and urine tests will be given to study virus levels in the body, and
           symptoms will be discussed.

        -  Participants will stop receiving the study drugs at Week 24.

        -  Followup clinic visits with blood tests will take place in Weeks 28, 36, 48, 52, 60, and
           72. Another liver biopsy will be performed at 48 weeks.

        -  Some participants may also be part of a smaller study. This study involves frequent
           blood draws to study drug and virus levels in the blood. The study will require a
           36-hour hospital inpatient visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated
      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. A combination of ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated
      interferon (PegIFN) is the currently recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and this
      may achieve viral clearance in 19% to 52% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (GT-1) and
      in 76% -80% of patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3. The standard of care is changing
      and will soon become an HCV protease inhibitor [Boceprevir/ Telaprevir in combination with
      PegIFN and RBV]. The registration studies for the new protease inhibitors demonstrated
      increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 60 70%. However, this is still
      associated with a high incidence of adverse events (AEs) and lower cure rates in several
      populations. Novel therapies that do not rely on an Interferon backbone will be required to
      enhance cure rates in various populations.

      This is a randomized controlled open-label study to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of GS-7977 (a potent and selective HCV NS5B inhibitor) given at a dose of 400 mg daily in
      combination with RBV to a total of 60 treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve HCV genotype 1 mono-infected
      individuals with less than or equal to stage 2 fibrosis.

      The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses to
      an interferon (IFN) free regimen as well as determine the role of RBV in IFN-free therapies.

               2. A positive HCV RNA test and anti-HCV antibody test together with either a liver
                  biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (or a liver biopsy performed before
                  enrollment with evidence of CHC disease, such as the presence of fibrosis).

          3. Na(SqrRoot) ve to all HCV antiviral treatment(s), including but not limited to
             immunomodulatory and nucleoside/tide treatments for chronic HCV infection.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 18 kg/m(2).

          5. Otherwise healthy as determined by the medical history, physical examination, ECG, and

          6. Liver biopsy obtained within 3 years (36 calendar months) prior to the Day 0 visit,
             with a fibrosis classification of less than or equal to stage 2 fibrosis. If no recent

         12. Subjects with compensated cirrhosis may be included (up to &lt; 20 percent of subjects
             randomized). Cirrhosis

        is defined as any one of the following:

          1. Any biopsy (or transient elastography, where locally approved) showing cirrhosis.

          2. Where approved by the local regulatory agency, transient elastography during the
             screening period with a result of &gt; 12.5 kPa

          3. A FibroSURE(r) score of &gt; 0.75 AND an AST:platelet ratio (APRI) of &gt; 2 performed
             during screening.

        Absence of cirrhosis is defined as one of the following:

          1. A liver biopsy performed within 24 calendar months of screening showing absence of
             cirrhosis

          2. Where approved by the local regulatory agency, transient elastography performed within
             12 calendar months preceding Day 1 with a result of &lt; 12.5 kPa

        institution and results obtained and used to determine inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        No more than 20 percent of the subjects randomized into the study will be cirrhotic.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Positive test at Screening for HBsAg, anti-HBc IgM Ab, or anti-HIV Ab.

          2. History of any other clinically significant chronic liver disease (e.g.,

             investigator, is thought to affect protocol compliance or drug metabolism and
             disposition.

          8. Abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including:

               1. Neutrophil count &lt; 1000 cells/mm(3)

             conditions, especially if treated with medications (such as hypertension), must be
             stable at the time of screening. No new therapies should be started prior to the study
             that may confound the assessment of study drug safety.
