  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the role of cervical cerclage versus expectant
      management in women with complete placenta previa (≥ 10mm over internal os) presenting with
      shortened cervical length ( ≥ 10mm and ≤ 30mm) between 18w0d and 26w0d of pregnancy.

      The purpose of this study is to perform a large multi-center randomized trial comparing the
      role of cervical cerclage versus expectant management in women with placenta previa
      presenting with shortened cervical length ( ≥ 10mm and ≤ 30mm) between 18w0d and 26w0d of
      gestation. In addition, the role of fetal fibronectin (fFN) for the prediction of preterm
      birth and hemorrhage will be elucidated. The hypothesis is that placement of a cervical
      cerclage between 18w0d to 26w0d in patients with a short cervix and complete placenta previa
      will decrease preterm birth as compared to expectantly managing these patients.
