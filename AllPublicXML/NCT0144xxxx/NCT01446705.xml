  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three out of four Veterans receive a portion of their care from non-VA providers. On April 9,
      2009, President Barack Obama directed the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department
      of Defense to create the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER). On August 2010, Secretary
      of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki visited Indianapolis, and after visiting with leaders
      from the VA Health Services Research &amp; Development (HSR&amp;D) Center of Excellence and the
      Regenstrief Institute, he made the following public comments regarding the latest partnership
      between the two institutions: &quot;This new technology allows safer, more secure, and private
      access to electronic health information which, in turn, enhances our ability to continue
      providing Veterans with the quality care that they have earned.&quot;

      This new technology refers to the VLER HEALTH program that the Indianapolis VA is now
      implementing in partnership with the Regenstrief Institute and Indiana Health Information
      Exchange (IHIE). This VA-IHIE demonstration project is intended to create the capacity for VA
      institutions to exchange health information with community partners.

      Investigators from the VA HSR&amp;D Center on Implementing Evidence-Based Practice are active
      collaborators in building and implementing this program. The VA-IHIE program provides the
      bi-directional exchange of health information between VA and non-VA providers. Based on our
      pilot study of linked VA-IHIE data, investigators are conducting an evaluation of the impact
      of the VA-IHIE demonstration project upon health care quality and cost of Veterans by taking
      advantage of the initiation of the implementation as a natural experiment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will perform a pre-post evaluation of the VA-IHIE implementation, with a
      concurrent control group, among Veterans seen at the Indianapolis VA. Data on care received
      by Veterans will be obtained for one year before, and one year after, VA-IHIE enrollment.
      Patients will be recruited into the VA-IHIE program in a rolling manner over the course of a
      year, and thus will have different calendar intervals of follow-up. For purposes of
      evaluation, investigators will approach the VA-IHIE implementation as a patient-directed
      intervention given that additional information available from the exchange is available only
      on a patient-by-patient basis, i.e., a provider cannot use exchange information available for
      one patient in the care of another. Although the VA-IHIE program will be implemented at the
      site level, patients will be enrolled individually.

    <description>This study will measure the impact of HIE upon health care quality the underuse of ambulatory care services. Measurements of underuse before and after implementation will detect improvements in the quality of care. To measure underuse, the study employs a measurement set that is sensitive to the potential effects and feasible for electronic data capture. 15 measures have been chosen, falling in the areas of prevention, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, mental health and osteoporosis.</description>

    <description>This study will use the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI) to calculate the outcome measure. The PQIs are a set of measures used with hospital inpatient data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. The PQIs consist of 14 conditions. The study will adopt 12 that are commonly used for adult patients: angina, asthma, bacterial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, dehydration, diabetes long-term complications, diabetes short-term complications, diabetes uncontrolled, hypertension, lower-limb amputation among diabetes patients, and urinary infection.</description>

It is an integer scale with a theoretical range of 0 to 43. A score of 0 would represent a healthy individual with no significant comorbidities. A score of 3 would indicate an individual with significant number of comorbidities. An individual with a score of 8 would have several sever comorbidities. Any score above 8 would be unlikely as with that many comorbidities and individual would be incapacitated.</description>

        <title>Health Care Quality: Ambulatory Care Performance Measures</title>
        <description>This study will measure the impact of HIE upon health care quality the underuse of ambulatory care services. Measurements of underuse before and after implementation will detect improvements in the quality of care. To measure underuse, the study employs a measurement set that is sensitive to the potential effects and feasible for electronic data capture. 15 measures have been chosen, falling in the areas of prevention, diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, mental health and osteoporosis.</description>

        <description>This study will use the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI) to calculate the outcome measure. The PQIs are a set of measures used with hospital inpatient data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. The PQIs consist of 14 conditions. The study will adopt 12 that are commonly used for adult patients: angina, asthma, bacterial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, dehydration, diabetes long-term complications, diabetes short-term complications, diabetes uncontrolled, hypertension, lower-limb amputation among diabetes patients, and urinary infection.</description>
