      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious disorder that affects many Veterans who
      have had a traumatic experience. The VA offers several different types of treatment for PTSD.
      We are researching different ways to match a Veteran to a type of treatment. Participants in
      this study will will be randomly assigned to either a 40-minute session in which they will
      learn about PTSD treatments and select a preferred treatment or to a 40-minute assessment
      interview. Those participants assigned to the assessment interview will have the opportunity
      to work with their Trauma Recovery Program provider to determine a plan for their PTSD
      treatment.
