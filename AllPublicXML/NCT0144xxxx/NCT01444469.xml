  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute attacks (exacerbations) of asthma are common and cause a great deal of suffering in
      asthmatic patients. Current treatments for asthma attacks are not completely effective and
      new and better treatments are needed. Viruses often cause asthma attacks and bacterial lung
      infections have also been associated with asthma attacks. However, the role for bacteria is
      uncertain. Current asthma guidelines for doctors treating asthma exacerbations do not
      recommend the routine use of antibiotics. The investigators would like to investigate whether
      or not azithromycin, which is a safe and well tolerated antibiotic (an antibacterial) that
      has been used for many years in the treatment of respiratory disease, might be of benefit in
      asthma attacks. As there is some evidence that azithromycin has anti-viral properties this
      may add to its benefits (antibiotics don't usually affect viruses). By looking at the effect
      of azithromycin on asthma attacks this will help us to show whether or not azithromycin
      should be recommended during an acute asthma attack in addition to the usual care that is
      provided to these patients as it may help them recover quicker from the exacerbation. The
      investigators will also be able to look at why azithromycin may be effective - if it is
      having an anti-bacterial and/or anti-viral effect.

          -  Patients presenting within 48 hours (of initial presentation to medical care) with an
             acute deterioration in asthma control (increased wheeze, dyspnea and/or cough and/or
             reduced PEF) and requiring a course of oral steroids

          -  Patients with a PEF or FEV1 less than 80% of predicted normal or patient's best at
             presentation, at recruitment or in the time elapsed between presentation and
             recruitment

          -  Patients must be able to complete diaries and quality of life questionnaires.
