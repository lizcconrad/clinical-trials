      Objective was to understand the dynamics of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) detection by nucleic
      acid amplification testing (NAAT) after treatment and consequences for test-of-cure practice.

      Prospective Cohort Study on Detection of Chlamydial ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) and
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in anorectal and cervicovaginal Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct)
      infections during 8 weeks after directly observed treatment with Azythromycin. The
      investigators systematically assessed presence of Ct plasmid DNA and rRNA through multiple
      time-sequential measurements following treatment with 1000mg Azythromycin. By convenience
      sampling at our outpatient sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic, 46 non-pregnant women
      and 6 men were included, contributing 45 cervicovaginal and 15 anorectal infections. Over a
      period of 8 weeks, patients provided a total of 1016 self-taken cervicovaginal and/or
      anorectal swabs (response: 94%). All patients were negative for Human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV), gonorrhea and Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), tested in anorectal Ct. Usual care was
      applied by advising abstinence or safe sex for one week and by providing treatment for steady
      partners. Participants provided written informed consent.
