    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose
      of PDA001 (given twice) in subjects with Stage II or III Pulmonary Sarcoidosis (PS) who are
      refractory to one or more of the following treatments for PS: methotrexate,immunosuppressants
      or cytotoxic agents.
