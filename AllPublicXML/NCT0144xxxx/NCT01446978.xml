    <textblock>
      Hepatitis A vaccine is the most frequently used traveler's vaccine, yet data on its ability
      to induce protective immunity in immunosuppressed travelers are scarce. The investigators
      assess the hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) - inhibitors and/or methotrexate (Mtx).

      In a previous study, 2 doses were not considered effective and there is therefore need for a
      study with an additional dose

      Methods: Parameters registered at baseline were: age, sex, duration of disease, medications,
      activity of disease (Visual Analogue Scale), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability
      Index, Disease Activity Score, Acute phase reactant and total immunoglobulin G in plasma).
      Hepatitis A vaccine (Epaxal or Havrix) were given at 0 and 6 months. Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
      antibodies is measured before vaccination and at month 1, 6 (before dose 2), 7 and 12 with
      quantitative HAV IgG, using the HAVAb-IgG Architect System, and by the HAVAB 2.0 assay on the
      AxSYM machine from Abbott. The level of protective immunity to HAV is defined as HAV IgG &gt;
      10mIU/mL.
