      The objective of the study is to evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of MF-4181, a
      hydrogel scaffold, in the reduction of the volume, appearance, and/or symptoms associated
      with keloid scarring in subjects undergoing surgical revision of keloid scars.

          -  The keloid must measure ≥ 0.5 cm and not extend onto other portions of the head, neck,
             or face.

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent. (Age 15-17 must have written

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of fever, migraine headaches, and/or recurrent upper respiratory infection.

          -  Active collagen vascular disease or vasculitis, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus,
             polyarthritis, dermatomyositis, systemic scleroderma or thrombotic thrombocytopenic
             purpura.

          -  Unwilling or unable to return for follow-up visits.

          -  Unwilling to refrain from use of any other scar treatment therapy/scar improving
             product, during the study, including steroid injections.

             use in the area to be treated.

          -  Current participation or participation within the last 3 months in the study of an
