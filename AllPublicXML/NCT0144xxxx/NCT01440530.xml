      The purpose of this 3 site, 24-week, Comparative Effectiveness Randomized Clinical Trial in
      Primary Care is to compare usual care to an online, multi-media, digital intervention for
      Persons with Type 2 Diabetes to Improve Engagement, Knowledge, and Self-Care.

      Objective: Technology shows promise to enhance standard care of diabetes with cost-effective,
      online lifestyle interventions. Compared to Primary Care (PC) Diabetes System of Care
      (control), the investigators hypothesized Technology Intervention for Diabetes Engagement &amp;
      Self-Care (TIDES) would significantly improve diabetes knowledge and self-care.

      Methods: Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, physician letters were sent to
      patients with type 2 diabetes, age &gt;18 years with HgA1c &gt;8% identified via Electronic Health
      Record (EHR) of an integrated US health system to invite participation in a 3-site, 24-week
      diabetes study. Of the 270 with &gt;1 week email/web use invited to the shared medical visit
      (SMV) orientation, 166 subjects provided written informed consent. Diabetes knowledge and
      self-care assessments, vital signs, HgA1c, fasting glucose and lipids were collected at
      baseline, 3 and 6 months. Following randomization to TIDES (N=117) or usual care (N=49),
      TIDES group was oriented to the multimedia online intervention including a dosed sequence of
      learning via email, video, slide shows, food solutions, expert questions and answers,and
      quizzes.

    <description>Change from Baseline Total Score on Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire(DKQ)at 6 months.The DKQ is the shortened 24-item version of the Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire was derived from an original 60-item instrument to reduce participant burden.Scores on the 60-item and 24-item versions are well correlated (r=0.85).Collins,G.S.,et al.,Modification and validation of the Revised Diabetes Knowledge Scale.

    <description>Change from Baseline on Partners in Health Scale(PIH)at 6 months.PIH is a validated instrument to measure self-management. The 11 items cover capacity and motivation for behavior change scored on a 9-point scale,with zero as best response and 8 worst.Four factors explain ~80% of variance in PIH scores: knowledge,symptom management,coping and adherence.Petkov, J.,P.
