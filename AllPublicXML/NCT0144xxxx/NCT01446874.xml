  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pneumonia is a major complication in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. It
      leads to considerable morbidity and contributes to perioperative morbidity. There is evidence
      in literature that supports the use of strategies for improved oral hygiene and specialized
      endotracheal tubes in preventing ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically
      ventilated patients. This study aims at utilizing a combination of these interventions in the
      perioperative period in patients undergoing planned thoracic surgical procedures.

    <time_frame>Within 30 days of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be considered to have postoperative pneumonia if they meet three of the following criteria within 30 days after surgery;
Fever (Temperature &gt;38.2 C)
Leucocytosis (WBC&gt;12,000/cu mm)
New infiltrate on chest X-ray
Positive sputum or bronchial culture
Treatment with antibiotics These criteria are utilized by the national Society of Thoracic Surgeons' database.</description>

    <measure>Compliance with preoperative brushing and mouthwash protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subject compliance is measured by the subject completing a daily brushing diary, along with The Modified Morisky Medication/Intervention Adherence Scale and a Knowledge Questionnaire.</description>
