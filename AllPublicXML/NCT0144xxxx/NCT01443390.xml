  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient with advanced cancer consults with a member of the Phase I drug development
      team, the investigators utilize all information possible to try to select a therapy for that
      patient which has the best chance of working for them. This information includes:

        1. Past published information

        2. Clinical experience and judgement

        3. Immunohistochemistry for specific targets (e.g., ER)

        4. Standard sequencing (e.g., for K-Ras) and other methods now available.

      The investigators have a new tool which warrants early exploration for what role it might
      eventually play in the process of selecting the best therapy for an individual patient. The
      basis of the current ancillary exploratory study is to gain initial experience with the
      operational aspects of this whole genome sequencing in this setting.

      1. To measure the time from biopsy to completion and final analysis of Whole Genome
           Sequencing (WGS) on patient tumor and non-tumor samples.

        2. To examine the frequency with which useable sequence data is obtained as a function of
           tumor volume received and percent tumor involvement in the biopsy

        3. To identify the frequency with which potential targets and pathways for therapy are
           discovered.

        4. To observe for any evidence that if anti-tumor activity from treatment is noted how
           would the genome sequencing have correlated with that activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced
             incurable cancer which has progressed on one or more prior chemotherapeutic, hormonal
             or biological regimens for advanced disease.

          -  Be a good medical candidate for and willing to undergo a biopsy or surgical procedure
             to obtain tissue, which may or may not be part of the patient's routine care for their
             malignancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastasis.

          -  Known HIV, HBV or HCV infection requiring antiviral therapy.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients or any patient with childbearing potential not
             using adequate contraception.

          -  Inaccessible tumor for biopsy
