    <textblock>
      There are several factor that can be related to Neonatal Thrombotic events. Among them
      hypercoagulability can be the cause of those events. Factor V Leiden (FVL) and Prothrombin
      mutation are the most common causes of hereditary thrombophilia. The incidence of in the arab
      population is known to be higher than the incidence in another western populations. The
      purpose of this study is to review retrospectively the thrombophilic risk factors that were
      found in a cohort of premature babies and term newborns treated and investigated at the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and at the Pediatric Hematology Unit.

      All the demographic and clinical data will be summarized. Factors non related to the
      coagulation system like catheters, severe infections or congenital heart defects will be
      recorded. Also a full workup of prothrombotic risk factors are routinely performed in those
      infants. The study included basic coagulation analysis, Protein C, S and Antithrombin III
      activity, Activated Protein C Resistance, serum homocystein, lipoprotein (a) and Lupus
      Anticoagulant.

      Also the three common genetic factors are analysed including Factor F Leiden (G1691A),
      Prothrombin Mutation (G20210A) and MTHFR polymorphism (C677T).
