      Background:

      - Parainfluenza is a virus that can cause infections in people. Most people infected with
      this virus have mild symptoms including fever, cough, red eyes, or runny nose (a common
      cold). Some people, especially those with a weakened immune system, get very sick from this
      virus. They may have difficulty breathing or develop lung infections. Currently, there are no
      specific treatments for parainfluenza. However, a drug called DAS181 may make the virus go
      away faster. Researchers are interested in testing DAS181 to see if it is safe and effective
      against parainfluenza.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of DAS181 as a treatment for parainfluenza.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have the parainfluenza virus and have developed
      symptoms within the past 10 days.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and questions about
           symptoms and activity levels. Participants will also have a lung function test and
           provide blood and nasal fluid samples.

        -  DAS181 is an inhaled medication, and everyone will receive a study medication inhaler.
           Participants will receive either DAS181 or a placebo through the inhaler. They will take
           it once every day for 5 days.

        -  Participants will have monitoring visits on days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28 to provide
           blood and nasal fluid samples and have a lung function test.

        -  Participants who still have the virus in their system on Day 28 will return to the
           clinic on Day 42 for more tests. Participants who still have the virus in their system
           on Day 42 will return to the clinic on Day 56 for more tests.

        -  Participants will have followup visits 6 months and 1 year after the start of the study.

      Parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections cause considerable morbidity in the immunocompromised
      population. In the immunocompetent population, PIV is usually self-limited, but can cause
      more severe disease including pneumonia and tracheobronchitis in adults, and croup and
      bronchiolitis in young children. DAS181, an inhaled sialidase, cleaves the binding site of
      PIV from respiratory mucosal cells limiting the ability of PIV to infect new cells. This may
      improve outcomes in patients with PIV infections.

      This exploratory randomized double-blind Phase 2 study will assess the safety and
      tolerability, and explore the efficacy of DAS181 versus placebo for the treatment of
      parainfluenza. Thirty eligible patients diagnosed with parainfluenza will be randomized in a
      2:1 allocation to receive either DAS181-F02 formulation (10 mg times 5 days) or placebo.
      Subjects will be followed on Study Days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28, 180, and 365 with a series of
      clinical, pulmonary function, functional status, virologic, and safety assessments.
