  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective registry of patients with an ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35%
      following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in order to test the hypothesis that
      wearable defibrillators (WD) will decrease overall mortality after discharge by decreasing
      arrhythmic death in this select population with high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD).
      This is a pilot project to determine the feasibility of a larger-scale study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone CABG surgery during current hospitalization

          -  Patients who have an ejection fraction ≤ 35% following the surgery.

          -  Patients who have dilated cardiomyopathy or prior myocardial infarction.

          -  Patients who are prescribed a wearable defibrillator following surgery.

          -  Patient who are at least 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have an active ICD.

          -  Patients who have an active unipolar pacemaker.

          -  Patients having a chest circumference over 56 inches or under 26 inches.

          -  Patients who are unable to consent or unwilling to wear the WCD after discharge or who
             do not agree to be contacted at 90 days.

          -  Patients with a mental, visual, physical or auditory deficit that could impair their
             ability to properly interact with a wearable defibrillator.

          -  Patients participating in another clinical study with mortality as the primary
             endpoint.

          -  Patients unable to use a wearable defibrillator due to physical conditions (bandages
             preventing electrode contact, physical deformities preventing electrode contact,
             dextrocardia, etc.).

          -  Patients who have decided to forgo resuscitation.
