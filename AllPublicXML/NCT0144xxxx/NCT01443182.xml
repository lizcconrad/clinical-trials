  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural
      therapy (TF-CBT) have both been found to be effective in treating post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) following single-event traumas and to be more effective than pure anxiety
      management or stabilization treatments. However, much less is known about the efficacy of the
      different treatment approaches in survivors of repeated or chronic interpersonal trauma.
      Recent evidence suggests that a combination of stabilization treatment + TF-CBT is
      efficacious in this population. Although EMDR is also often used in survivors of chronic
      interpersonal trauma, evidence on its efficacy are still poor. The aim of the current study
      is to compare the efficacy of (1) stabilization + TF-CBT and (2) stabilization + EMDR using a
      randomized controlled trial in a routine clinical setting.
