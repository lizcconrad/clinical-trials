    <measure>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) for the Treated Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs and is used to detect evidence of blockages in the peripheral vessels. It is calculated by dividing the higher systolic blood pressure in the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms.
ABI=Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure. The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and an ABI between 0.9 and 1.3 is considered normal. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 severe disease.
A value greater than 1.3 is considered abnormal suggesting calcification of the walls of the arteries and noncompressible vessels, reflecting severe peripheral vascular disease. For patients in whom the ABI cannot be accurately measured , toe pressure measurement and toe brachial index should be used.</description>

             study-required medication that is not amenable to pre-treatment.

         19. Subject has a known bleeding or hypercoagulability disorder or significant anemia (Hgb
             &lt; 8.0) that cannot be corrected.

         20. Subject requires general anesthesia for the procedure.

         21. Subject has ischemic or neuropathic ulcers on either foot.

         22. Subject has had any type of amputation to the ipsilateral extremity, or a
             contralateral extremity amputation other than of the toe or forefoot.

         23. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator,
             is unable to give informed consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse
             personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include: Individuals with mental
             disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, subjects in
             emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of
             giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also may include members of a group
             with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and
             laboratory personnel, employees of the sponsor, members of the armed forces, and
             persons kept in detention.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Total occlusion of the ipsilateral iliac artery.

          2. Target extremity has multilevel disease that requires other staged procedures within
             30 days before or after the procedure.

          3. Target extremity has been previously treated with any of the following: surgical
             bypass or endarterectomy.

          4. Target vessel has an angiographically significant (&gt; 50% DS) lesion located distal to
             the target lesion that requires treatment at the time of the index procedure or by a
             staged procedure within 30 days before or after the procedure.

          5. Target vessel has been previously treated at any location with a stent, or has been
             previously treated ≤ 5 cm from the proximal or distal margin of the target lesion with
             brachytherapy or laser.

          6. Target lesion is within or adjacent to an aneurysm.

          7. Target lesion or vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus that is unresponsive to
             anti-thrombotic therapies.

          8. Subject has a contralateral superficial femoral or proximal popliteal artery lesion
             that requires treatment within 30 days before or after the procedure.

          9. Subject has a history of aortic revascularization or has an abdominal aortic aneurysm
             &gt; 3 cm.

         10. Subject has evidence of thromboembolism or atheroembolism from treatment of an
             ipsilateral iliac lesion.

         11. .Subject has any condition that precludes safe access to the target lesion or target
             vessel, e.g. severe calcification, excessive tortuosity.

         12. Target lesion requires use of re-entry, ablative, cutting balloon, atherectomy, or
             similar devices to cross or treat the lesion.

        <title>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) for the Treated Limb</title>
        <description>A measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs and is used to detect evidence of blockages in the peripheral vessels. It is calculated by dividing the higher systolic blood pressure in the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms.
ABI=Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure. The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and an ABI between 0.9 and 1.3 is considered normal. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 severe disease.
A value greater than 1.3 is considered abnormal suggesting calcification of the walls of the arteries and noncompressible vessels, reflecting severe peripheral vascular disease. For patients in whom the ABI cannot be accurately measured , toe pressure measurement and toe brachial index should be used.</description>

        <title>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) for the Treated Limb</title>
        <description>A measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs and is used to detect evidence of blockages in the peripheral vessels. It is calculated by dividing the higher systolic blood pressure in the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms.
ABI=Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure. The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and an ABI between 0.9 and 1.3 is considered normal. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 severe disease.
A value greater than 1.3 is considered abnormal suggesting calcification of the walls of the arteries and noncompressible vessels, reflecting severe peripheral vascular disease. For patients in whom the ABI cannot be accurately measured , toe pressure measurement and toe brachial index should be used.</description>

        <title>Any Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)</title>
        <description>TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. All TLR should be prospectively classified as clinically-driven or not clinically-driven by the investigator prior to repeat angiography. An independent angiographic core laboratory will verify that the severity of percent diameter stenosis meets requirements for clinical indication and will overrule in cases where investigator reports are not in agreement. The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal to the stent and to 5 mm distal to the stent.</description>

        <title>Walking Impairment Questionnaire Scores</title>
        <description>Measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), a disease-specific instrument utilized to characterize walking ability through a questionnaire as an alternative to treadmill testing. It is a measure of subject-perceived walking performance for subjects with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and/or intermittent claudication. The WIQ quantifies patient-reported walking speed, walking distance, and stair-climbing ability, respectively, on a scale of 0 (= worst) to 100 (= best). The highest possible score for each domain is 100%, which indicates no difficulty. Lowest possible score for each domain is 0%, which indicates inability to perform the activity.</description>

The WIQ quantifies patient-reported walking speed, walking distance, and stair-climbing ability, respectively, on a scale of 0 (= worst) to 100 (= best). The highest possible score for each domain is 100%, which indicates no difficulty. Lowest possible score for each domain is 0%, which indicates inability to perform the activity.</description>

        <title>Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol) Total Scores</title>
        <description>Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol) : A standardized, validated questionnaire used to evaluate vascular disease-specific health outcomes. VascuQol total score includes scores of Activity Domain, Symptom Domain, Pain Domain, Emotional Domain and Social Domain. Each item is rated as a 7 point response scale, with a score of 1 being the worst and a score of 7 the best possible. The total average score is the sum of all 25 items scores divided by 25. For each separate domain an average score can be calculated (sum of all items of one domain divided by the number of items of that domain). The highest score for each domain is 7, which indicates best health outcome.
There are no sub scales.</description>
