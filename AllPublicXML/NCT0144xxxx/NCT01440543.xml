  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water immersion insertion and carbon dioxide (CO2)instead of room air insufflation as
      alternative colonoscopy techniques have been documented to decrease patient discomfort during
      and after the procedure.

      This prospective, randomized, single-center trial was designed to evaluate whether the
      combination of water immersion during insertion and CO2 insufflation during withdrawal
      (Water/CO2)for minimal sedation colonoscopy (2 mg of midazolam i.v.)is superior to the other
      colonoscopy methods (Water/Air, CO2/CO2, Air/Air).

    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Successful minimal sedation colonoscopy using assigned technique was defined as reaching the caecum without switch to another insertion method and / or without additional sedation beyond the initial administration of 2 mg of midazolam.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success Rate of Minimal Sedation Colonoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A succesful colonoscopy using assigned technique was defined as reaching the caecum without switching to another insertion method and without additional sedation beyond the initial 2 mg of midazolam. Any time the further insertion of the scope was not possible, the patient reported pain level &gt; 3 using a 7-point Likert scale [7] (0 = no pain, 6 = intolerable pain) or demanded additional sedation, the endoscopist preferentially switched to the other insertion technique. Enhanced sedation was used in case the other technique had not been successful.</description>

    <measure>Patient Comfort During the Procedure and During First 24 Hours After Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort was assessed using a 18-point questionnaire form based on 0-6 continuous scale (0 = best, 6 = worst)- abdominal pain during, 30 minutes, 3, 12 and 24 hours after the procedure, bloating duringm 30 minutes, 3, 12 and 24 hours after the procedure, flatus during, 30 minutes, 3, 12 and 24 hours after the procedure, impact on patient´s daily activities during first 24 hours after the procedure, willingnes to repeat the colonoscopy and overall satisfaction with the procedure</description>

        <title>Success Rate of Minimal Sedation Colonoscopy</title>
        <description>Successful minimal sedation colonoscopy using assigned technique was defined as reaching the caecum without switch to another insertion method and / or without additional sedation beyond the initial administration of 2 mg of midazolam.</description>

        <title>Patient Comfort During the Procedure and During First 24 Hours After Procedure</title>
        <description>Comfort was assessed using a 18-point questionnaire form based on 0-6 continuous scale (0 = best, 6 = worst)- abdominal pain during, 30 minutes, 3, 12 and 24 hours after the procedure, bloating duringm 30 minutes, 3, 12 and 24 hours after the procedure, flatus during, 30 minutes, 3, 12 and 24 hours after the procedure, impact on patient´s daily activities during first 24 hours after the procedure, willingnes to repeat the colonoscopy and overall satisfaction with the procedure</description>

        <title>Success Rate of Minimal Sedation Colonoscopy</title>
        <description>A succesful colonoscopy using assigned technique was defined as reaching the caecum without switching to another insertion method and without additional sedation beyond the initial 2 mg of midazolam. Any time the further insertion of the scope was not possible, the patient reported pain level &gt; 3 using a 7-point Likert scale [7] (0 = no pain, 6 = intolerable pain) or demanded additional sedation, the endoscopist preferentially switched to the other insertion technique. Enhanced sedation was used in case the other technique had not been successful.</description>
        <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
        <population>Statistical power was calculated for the primary endpoint. A sample size of 145 subjects per insertion arm was calculated using two-tailed α = 0,05, β = 0,05, assuming that 80% versus 60% success rate in the water (Water/CO2 and Water/Air) and gas (CO2/CO2 and Air/Air) insertion arms would have been clinically relevant.</population>
