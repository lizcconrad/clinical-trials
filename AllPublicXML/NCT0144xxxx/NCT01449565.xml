  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, VIVITROL) is an FDA-approved medication with efficacy in
      treating alcohol dependence and prevention of relapse to opioid dependence. It has shown
      promise in reducing relapse to amphetamine use among amphetamine-dependent, yet currently
      amphetamine-abstinent heterosexuals. The investigators will expand upon this promising work
      to determine whether monthly intramuscular injections of naltrexone will reduce
      methamphetamine (meth) use among actively using, meth-dependent men who have sex with men
      (MSM) in this double-blind randomized controlled trial of extended-release naltrexone versus
      placebo. The investigators will focus on MSM because of the disproportionate and intertwining
      epidemics of meth use and HIV in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 100 sexually active, meth-dependent MSM who will be randomized
      1:1 to receive monthly injections of extended-release naltrexone (n=50) or placebo (n=50) for
      12 weeks at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Study participants will be seen weekly at our site at the HIV
      Prevention Section of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, where they will provide
      urine for drug testing and participate in substance use counseling. All participants will
      receive HIV risk-reduction counseling. Behavior will be assessed using standardized measures
      via audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI).
