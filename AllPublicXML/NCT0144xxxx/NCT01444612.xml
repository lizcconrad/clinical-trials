  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
      (PE), is a common post-operative complication. The effectiveness of fondaparinux compared
      with other injectable anticoagulants in VTE following major orthopedic and abdominal surgery
      has been evaluated in database studies; however, the effectiveness of injectable
      anticoagulant medications following cancer-related surgeries in the practice setting has not
      been as well documented.

      The objective of this study is to analyze patient records from a national hospital database
      and compare the outcomes and costs between four types of injectable anticoagulant medications
      that were prescribed for the prevention of VTE following cancer-related surgery. This
      analysis will assess and quantify the outcomes, resource utilization, and cost of care for
      patients receiving fondaparinux, enoxaparin, dalteparin or unfractionated heparin. The
      outcomes of interest include the occurence of VTE, rates of major bleeds, medical resource
      utilization, and total costs (medical plus pharmacy).

      The source of data for this study is the Premier Perspective Database™. This hospital claims
      database links de-identified inpatient medical, pharmacy, and billing data from more than 500
      hospitals.

      This study is a retrospective cohort study that uses propensity score matching to adjust for
      the differences between the numbers of patients treated with each medication.
