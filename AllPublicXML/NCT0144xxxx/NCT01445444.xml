      The purpose of the current study is:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a habit reversal training (HRT) approach for children
           ages 7 to 17 years of age inclusive with a diagnosis of trichotillomania.

        2. To explore factors that may relate to symptom severity, treatment outcome, and
           psychosocial impairment (e.g., specific symptom presence, co-morbidity, emotional
           regulation).

      The purpose of this research study is to further investigate how well Habit Reversal Training
      (HRT) works to reduce hair-pulling symptoms in children and adolescents with trichotillomania
      (TTM).

      All children will have the option to receive 8 weekly HRT sessions. Half of all children will
      be chosen at random to receive these sessions immediately following the pre-assessment and
      the remaining half will receive them after eight weeks (TAU condition). These sessions will
      focus developing skills for managing TTM and to decrease hair pulling. Such skills may
      include teaching your child to replace hair-pulling with another behavior. In the TAU
      condition, participants will seek the treatment in the community, with the option of
      receiving HRT treatment sessions at the end of the study.

      Participants in both groups will undergo four assessments in total (1) Pre-Assessment; (2)
      Post-treatment Assessment; (3) One-month Follow-up; (4)Three-month Follow-up. These
      assessments will involve several interviews that ask about different psychological symptoms
      that your child experiences such as sadness, anxiety, and TTM.

    <description>This measure assesses the number of hair-pulling urges, the intensity of the urges, the ability of the patients to distract themselves from the urge to pull their hair, the number of hair-pulling incidents, attempts to resist hair-pulling, the ability to resist hair-pulling, and feeling uncomfortable about hair-pulling. Individual items are rated for severity from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms).</description>

    <description>The NIMH-TIS is a clinician rated scale (0-10 rating) measuring overall impairment produced by the time spent pulling or concealing damage, ability to control pulling, severity of alopecia, interference, and incapacitation caused by the pulling.</description>

The overall focus of treatment is to provide patients with tools to help them manage and reduce hair-pulling.
components:
Session 1. (a) to develop an understanding of the subject's hair-pulling through an initial interview; and (b) to establish a protocol for ongoing assessment.
Session 2. implement habit reversal, including awareness training, competing response training, and social support.
Sessions 3-8. For subjects with a single hair-pulling site, Session 3 will review and practice HRT procedures and name solutions to problems that may have arisen. For those with multiple hair-pulling sites, treatment will be reviewed for the first site in the hierarchy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient children between the ages of 7-17 years.

          -  Meets DSM-IV criteria for a primary diagnosis of TTM

          -  English speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lifetime DSM-IV bipolar, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder, or substance

             option of discontinuing such services to enroll in the study. Those randomized to
             treatment as usual (TAU) will be able to continue or initiate psychosocial
             interventions whereas those randomized to HRT will not receive other interventions
             concurrent with HRT.

             anxioloytics) within 4 weeks before study enrollment, any change in antipsychotics
             within 3 weeks prior to the screening assessment, any change in fluoxetine or
             atamoxetine within 6 weeks of study enrollment, and any change in alpha-2 agonists or
             stimulants within 1 week of study enrollment. Those randomized to TAU may make
             medication changes following randomization, including starting a medication; those
             randomized to HRT will remain stable on medications during the study.

          -  Unwillingness of parents to make the commitment to accompany their child for multiple
             study visits, unwillingness to take part in randomization, inability to attend weekly

          -  Presence of a significant and/or unstable medical illness which might lead to
             hospitalization during the study.
