  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Sorafenib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that works by blocking proteins thought to
           be important for tumor growth. It has blocked the growth of tumors in test tubes and in
           some animal models.

        -  Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer.

        -  This is the first time sorafenib is being tested in children with cancer.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the highest dose of sorafenib that can be safely given to children and
           young adults with cancer.

        -  To determine the side effects and benefits, if any, of sorafenib in children and young
           adults with cancer.

        -  To study how the body handles sorafenib and the drug's effects on cells and proteins in
           the blood.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients between 2 and 21 years of age with solid tumors or leukemias that do not respond to
      standard treatment.

      Patients between 2 and 21 years of age with AML and FLT3-ITD mutation for Part C of the
      study.

      Design:

        -  Patients take sorafenib tablets every day about every 12 hours in 28-day treatment
           cycles for a maximum of 24 cycles.

        -  The dose is increased in succeeding groups of 3 to 6 children until serious side effects
           occur. Subsequent patients then receive the drug at lower doses.

        -  Patients have a physical exam, blood and urine tests, and CT or MRI scans periodically
           to monitor safety and treatment effects. Leukemia patients also have bone marrow
           aspirates. Patients with a solid tumor may have an MRI. Children whose bones are still
           growing have X-rays of the lower legs periodically to monitor bone structure.

        -  Patients have additional blood studies to determine the amount of sorafenib in the
           blood, the effect of the drug on proteins and cells in the blood, and genetic
           differences that affect how individuals respond to the drug.

      Background:

      The ras gene product plays a critical role in cell signal transduction. Activating Ras
      mutations occur in 30% of all human cancers, and the ras pathway may be upregulated in
      absence of ras mutations. Activated Ras initiates several signaling cascades, and the best
      characterized is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Ras initiates this pathway by recruiting Raf
      kinase to the plasma membrane where it is further modified for full activation. A high
      frequency of B-Raf mutations has recently been reported in a variety of adult solid cancers.

      Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a novel, orally bioavailable, bi-aryl urea, which potently
      inhibits wild type and mutant raf. In addition, sorafenib inhibits several receptor tyrosine
      kinases including human VEGFR-2, FLT3, c-KIT, and p38 alpha, suggesting that sorafenib may
      mediate anti-tumor activity via several additional mechanisms. In early adult clinical trials
      sorafenib has been well tolerated, with minimal myelosuppression. Dose-limiting toxicities
      were hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, pain, and rash. Responses to
      sorafenib have been observed in early clinical trials in adults with a variety of tumors,
      including tumors that have not been described to harbor raf mutations. Sorafenib recently was
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of refractory renal cell cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral Sorafenib in children with refractory
      solid tumors or refractory leukemias.

      To define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of Sorafenib.

      To evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of sorafenib
      administered at the MTD for refractory leukemias in patients with AML and FLT3-ITD mutations

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients (greater than or equal to 24 months to less than or equal to 21 years) with
      refractory solid tumors or refractory leukemias.

      Patients (greater than or equal to 24 months to less than or equal to 21 years) with AML and
      FLT3-ITD mutation (Part C). Participation in pharmacokinetic sampling is mandatory for Part
      C.

      DESIGN:

      Sorafenib will be administered orally BID on a continuous dosing schedule (28 days = 1
      treatment cycle). Dose escalations will be performed to define the MTD.

      Initially, the spectrum of toxicity and MTD will be defined in patients with solid tumors.

      Patients with refractory leukemias will be entered at the solid tumor MTD, to determine
      whether patients with leukemia tolerate this dose level.

      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of sorafenib will be studied in
      patients with solid tumors and leukemias.

      In Part C: 14 patients will receive sorafenib at 150 mg/m(2)/dose, BID to evaluate the
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of sorafenib.

        -  PATIENT ELIGIBILITY:

        All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7
        days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated. If more than 7 calendar days elapse
        between the date eligibility studies outlined in Section 4.1.7 were obtained and the start
        date of treatment, then the following studies must be repeated prior to treatment: CBC with
        differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine, lipase and amylase. If any of
        these repeat laboratory studies are outside the parameters required for eligibility (labs
        may again be repeated within 48-72 hours), then the patient is off protocol therapy.
        Imaging and bone marrow studies are required within 2 weeks prior to the start of protocol
        therapy.

        The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be waived (per

                  normal (ULN) for age, and

               -  SGPT (ALT) less than or equal to ULN for age. For the purpose of this study, the
                  ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L.

               -  Serum albumin greater than or equal to 2 g/dL.

          2. Patients with leukemias (Part B and C):

               -  Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) less than or equal to 1.5 times
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and

               -  SGPT (ALT) less than or equal to 5.0 times the ULN for age (less than or equal to
                  225 U/L). For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L.

               -  Serum albumin greater than or equal to 2 g/dL.

        Normal PT, PTT, and INR for patients on prophylactic anticoagulation only.

        Normal serum lipase and amylase.

        Adequate Pulmonary Function Defined As:

        No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance and a pulse oximetry greater than
        94% if there is clinical indication for determination.

        For Part A and B Only: Diastolic Blood Pressure Within The Upper Limit Of Normal Defined
        As:

        A diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and
        gender (Appendix V) measured as in Section 8.1 of the protocol and not be receiving
        medication for treatment of hypertension.

        For Part C only: Blood Pressure Within the Upper Limit of Normal Defined As:

        A blood pressure (BP) ...
