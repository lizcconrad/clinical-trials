    <textblock>
      Epidural anesthesia is associated with potential risks and complications, post dural puncture
      headache (PDPH) one of the most recognized with epidural or spinal anesthesia. Accidental
      dural punctures occur with approximately 1.5% of all epidural attempts. Studies have
      suggested that the use of an intrathecal catheter reduces the incidence of PDPH. A systematic
      review of the existing literature will identify if there is reliable evidence to support this
      theory. A secondary outcome, headache severity, will also be explored via incidence rates of
      epidural blood patch, as this intervention is performed as a treatment for the most severe
      headaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post dural puncture headache (PDPH) is one of the recognized complications experienced with
      epidural or spinal anesthesia, resulting from needle puncture of the dura layer of the
      meninges. This puncture can be deliberate (during spinal anesthesia) or accidental (during
      epidural anesthesia). Dural punctures allow a leak of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to the
      characteristic syndrome of PDPH; also known as a spinal headache or low-pressure headache.
      Accidental dural punctures occur with approximately 1.5% of all epidural attempts. Studies
      have estimated that, within the obstetrical population, headaches resulting from an
      inadvertent dural puncture are as high as 50% to 75%.

      As the risk of accidental dural punctures (ADP) cannot be eliminated, research has focused on
      possible interventions that may be taken in order to avoid the onset of a PDPH, eliminate its
      severity, or treat effects. One of the most common and effective treatments being an epidural
      blood patch (EBP). More recently, threading the epidural catheter directly into the
      intrathecal space after the dural puncture has been recognized as a viable option.
