      BACKGROUND. Sleep deficiency (not getting enough sleep) is widespread in American adults and
      can lead to many harmful health outcomes such as a higher risk of obesity, heart disease, and
      diabetes. Sleep deficiency can also harm cognitive performance, which refers to one's
      awareness and thinking ability. Sleep deficiency and sleep-related health issues are of high
      interest among those who have irregular and/or extended work schedules, because such
      schedules can interfere with normal biological rhythms of sleepiness and wakefulness.

      PURPOSE. This study will examine the health and cognitive effects of work schedule and sleep
      patterns in caregivers (such as nurses, laboratory technicians, and non-clinical hospital
      staff). The investigators hypothesize that the nontraditional, irregular, and extended work
      hours common in these professions will have adverse health and cognitive effects. The
      purposes of this protocol are to:

        -  Enroll caregivers into a one year cohort study on the relationships among work schedule,
           sleep, diet, chronic disease, and cognitive performance. (A cohort study follows a group
           of participants over time to see how different behaviors or risk factors affect health.)

        -  Collect data from caregivers on work schedule, sleep, diet, chronic disease, and
           cognitive performance.

        -  Give personalized information and feedback to caregivers about these health factors.

        -  Educate caregivers about healthy diet and exercise choices.

        -  Collect saliva from caregivers for future research on the role of genes in health.
           (Specimen collection for genetic testing will be offered as a separate option for study
           participants.) RECRUITMENT. This study will use the Let's Get Healthy! health research
           and education program (OHSU IRB #3694) as a platform for recruitment and data
           collection. Caregivers will be invited to participate in a Let's Get Healthy! event and
           will be given information prior to the event about the cohort study. At the Let's Get
           Healthy! event, caregivers will first consent to the anonymous research study (OHSU IRB
           #3694), in which demographic and health screening data are linked to a random number.
           Caregivers will then have the option to consent to a cohort study, in which data are no
           longer anonymous but instead linked to participants' names and contact information.

      PROCEDURES. This cohort study piggybacks on procedures already approved for the Let's Get
      Healthy! program (OHSU IRB #3694). Let's Get Healthy! is a study in which participants
      provide anonymous data at health fairs through any or all of the following manners: short
      computer surveys on cancer awareness, risk factors, and family history (with immediate
      feedback given on cancer risk and prevention); short computer surveys on diet and sleep
      patterns (with immediate printed feedback given); health screening measurements (blood
      pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, body mass index, body fat percentage); a
      finger stick to assess sugar and fat levels in blood; and a mouthwash swish to provide a
      saliva specimen.

      However, this cohort study (OHSU IRB #7542) will make the following changes and additions:

        -  Personal health data, instead of being anonymous, will be linked to participants' names
           and contact information (for follow-up data collection).

        -  Let's Get Healthy! events will include cognitive performance tests, a preventative-care
           survey, and a work schedule survey.

        -  Participants will provide data not only at an initial Let's Get Healthy! event, but also
           at a follow-up event and during the time period between events. Between events,
           participants will do the surveys on work schedule, diet, and sleep, and they will
           complete cognitive performance tests.

        -  There will be a separate consent process for participants to provide a fully
           identifiable saliva specimen.

      DATA ANALYSIS. Participants' health data will be fully identifiable at the time of data
      collection but will be coded and stored in a physically separate location from the
      identifiable information. The link between identifiable information and coded health
      information will be stored on a password protected computer, and all identifiable information
      will be deleted upon completion of data analyses. Data will be analyzed to explore
      relationships among work schedule, sleep, diet, body composition, metabolic health, chronic
      disease, and cognitive performance in caregivers. Genetic relationships with these factors
      will be analyzed in those who provided a saliva specimen during entry visit data collection.
