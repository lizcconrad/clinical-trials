      The mailer will encourage all employees of one of Evive's partner companies to attend an
      on-site free flu shot clinic they are offering in the fall of 2011. The research will examine
      differences in follow-through on getting a flu shot at an on-site clinic among the targeted
      population during the ~1 month period when clinics are being offered (following the mailing)
      as a function of experimental condition.

    <description>In this condition, participants will be prompted to think about a list of healthy behaviors and check off (privately - they will never send this flyer back or show it to anyone) whether &quot;yes&quot; they conform to the healthy habit or &quot;no&quot; they do not. The list of healthy behaviors is a list that most people will find fairly easy, and thus most participants will answer &quot;yes&quot; to each habit. The final question will be a prompt to get a flu shot. The hope is that when people realize how healthy their habits are, it will seem natural to them to engage in yet another healthy habit and receive a flu shot.</description>
