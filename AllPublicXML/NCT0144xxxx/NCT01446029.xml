      The purpose of this study is to determine if the adoption of a chronic care model in
      conjunction with tele monitoring and case management can reduce the risk of death,
      hospitalization, emergency room visits, or admission to a skilled nursing facility in
      patients with chronic kidney disease compared to usual care.

    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue. Approximately, 11% of the US
      population has CKD with an increased prevalence among individuals great than 65years. Many
      individuals with CKD go unrecognized because they are typically asymptomatic. Individuals
      with CKD have been demonstrated to have a greater risk for mortality, hospitalization and
      development of end stage kidney disease. Also, individuals with CKD consume a significantly
      greater proportion of health care expenditures compared to other patients. This study aims to
      determine if the adoption of a chronic care model in conjunction with telemonitoring and case
      management can reduce risk of death, hospitalization, ER visits or admission to a skilled
      nursing facility in patients with CKD compared to usual care. This study will use a
      randomized controlled trial. Few interventions have been demonstrated to improve clinical
      outcomes in patients with CKD. If successful, this study will enable the VA to provide high
      quality care to patients with CKD while potentially reducing the cost of providing care.
