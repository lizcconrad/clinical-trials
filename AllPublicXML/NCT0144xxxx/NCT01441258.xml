    <textblock>
      Harley and colleagues demonstrated that adding Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
      skills-groups and therapist consultation to treatment as usual successfully reduced symptoms
      of depression. The present study will expand upon these findings. Second, DBT is not known
      for reducing suicidal ideation (SI), a major risk factor for suicide . The present study will
      tailor the aforementioned skills-groups to specifically target suicidal thoughts and
      behaviors through Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) strategies aimed at increasing
      problem-solving deficits, hopelessness, and negativistic thinking. Third, the present study
      will extend this DBT-based approach to a novel population. Fourth, the present study is the
      first DBT intervention to employ state-of-the-art multi-method measurement (including
      objective assessment) of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants in the DBT skills (DBT-S) group will show
      improvements in level of suicidality as measured by decreased scores on the Beck Scale for
      Suicide Ideation as compared with participants in the Wait List-Treatment as Usual (WL-TAU)
      group.

    <description>The intervention will be delivered within an 18-week, once-weekly, one-and-half-hour skill group (8 participants per group) comprised of the same four modules administered in standard DBT skills training groups: (1) mindfulness, (2) interpersonal effectiveness, (3) emotion regulation, and (4) distress tolerance. There will be four sessions for each module totaling 16 sessions. There will be two booster sessions reviewing mindfulness and the concept of dialectics in-between each of the modules (i.e., between modules 2 and 3 and 3 and 4).</description>
