  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of pegylated interferon alfa (peginterferon alfa) (e.g. Pegasys) plus ribavirin and
      treatment regimens containing direct-acting antivirals in participants with chronic hepatitis
      C who are treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced and HIV HCV co-infected. Data will be
      collected from participants receiving treatment according to current Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SPC) and local labeling for the duration of their treatment and a 24-week
      follow-up.

    <time_frame>24 weeks after end of treatment (up to 118 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SVR24 rate for dual therapy participants is defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50 international unit/milliliters (IU/mL) (as measured by a commercially available HCV RNA test with lower limit of detection less than or equal to [&lt;=] 50 IU/mL) at 24 weeks post completion of the treatment period. If a quantitative test was used, the lower limit of quantification had to be &lt;=50 IU/mL. SVR24 for triple therapy participants is defined as percentage of participants with undetectable HCV RNA assessed by a test with lower limit of detection &lt;= 50 IU/mL at 24 weeks post completion of the treatment period.</description>

Results of HCV RNA tests with LLD and LLQ &gt;50 IU/mL were considered as non-response. VR for triple therapy participants is defined as undetectable HCV RNA assessed by a test with lower limit of detection &lt;=50 IU/mL (UVR). Results of HCV RNA tests with an LLD &gt;50 IU/mL were considered as non-response for triple therapy participants.</description>

          <title>Virological Response at Various on Treatment Time Points and End of Treatment (EOT)</title>
          <description>Virological response (VR) for dual therapy participants is defined as HCV RNA &lt;50 IU/mL as assessed by a qualitative HCV RNA test with a lower limit of detection (LLD) &lt;=50 IU/mL or as assessed by a quantitative test with a lower limit of quantification (LLQ) &lt;=50 IU/mL for all time points concerned. Results of HCV RNA tests with LLD and LLQ &gt;50 IU/mL were considered as non-response. VR for triple therapy participants is defined as undetectable HCV RNA assessed by a test with lower limit of detection &lt;=50 IU/mL (UVR). Results of HCV RNA tests with an LLD &gt;50 IU/mL were considered as non-response for triple therapy participants.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virological Response (SVR) in Participants With Dose Reductions or Treatment Interruptions</title>
        <description>SVR 12 and 24 rates for dual therapy participants are defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50 international unit/milliliters (IU/mL) (as measured by a commercially available HCV RNA test with lower limit of detection less than or equal to [&lt;=] 50 IU/mL) at 12 or 24 weeks post completion of the treatment period. If a qualitative test was used, then the lower limit of detection has to be &lt;=50 IU/mL. SVR12 and 24 rates for triple therapy participants are defined as percentage of participants with undetectable HCV RNA assessed by a test with lower limit of detection &lt;= 50 IU/mL at 12 or 24 weeks post completion of the treatment period. Here, number of participants analyzed excluded the participants with premature withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or non-safety reasons and participants without dose reductions or interruptions during the first 99 study days.</description>

          <description>SVR 12 and 24 rates for dual therapy participants are defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50 international unit/milliliters (IU/mL) (as measured by a commercially available HCV RNA test with lower limit of detection less than or equal to [&lt;=] 50 IU/mL) at 12 or 24 weeks post completion of the treatment period. If a qualitative test was used, then the lower limit of detection has to be &lt;=50 IU/mL. SVR12 and 24 rates for triple therapy participants are defined as percentage of participants with undetectable HCV RNA assessed by a test with lower limit of detection &lt;= 50 IU/mL at 12 or 24 weeks post completion of the treatment period. Here, number of participants analyzed excluded the participants with premature withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or non-safety reasons and participants without dose reductions or interruptions during the first 99 study days.</description>
