  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the success of daily supplementation of multiple
      probiotic bacterial cultures over 12 weeks in increasing the percentage of excess weight loss
      in the RNYGB (Gastric Bypass) weight loss population.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Hypothesis:

      The daily supplementation of a probiotic will increase weight loss compared to a placebo
      supplement in the post-operative gastric bypass patients.

      Study Design:

      All patients in this study will be scheduled to undergo the RNYGB (Gastric Bypass) procedure
      to assist in weight loss. Patients in this study will be randomized to one of two groups:
      Group 1 (Probiotics) or Group 2 (Placebo). Patients will begin supplementation at the
      beginning of their 4 week pre-surgery Optifast© 800 diet. All patients will take supplements
      for a total of 12 weeks. Nutritional education and support will be provided to each patient
      enrolled in the study. Weight loss will be measured using a machine that measures body
      composition. All patients will complete a quality of life questionnaire with regard to
      gastrointestinal health and a hair loss survey pre treatment and at the end of the study.

    <description>Percentage of weight loss will be measured using the The RJL Systems' Quantum IX on all patients for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to assess human body composition before beginning supplementation and at the end of the 12 week period. The Tanita system will be used as the back-up machine throughout the study as applicable.</description>

    <description>The probiotic supplementation will use lactic acid bacteria in the &quot;ProbioMax DF™&quot; supplement from Xymogen, Inc. This preparation consists of a four-strain probiotic with 100 billion CFU per vegetable capsule. The strains included are Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Lactobacillus planarum Lp-115, and Bifidobacterium longum B1-05.</description>
