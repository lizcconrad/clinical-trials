      Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop and validate multimodal testing of exocrine
      pancreatic function (EPF). The investigators will be testing exocrine pancreatic function in
      patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Exocrine pancreatic function and imaging will be
      correlated to age group, genotype, nutritional status and quality of life. Earlier detection
      of exocrine pancreatic failure in the non classical form of cystic fibrosis may be of
      therapeutically benefit.

      Hypotheses Endoscopic short test can be applied in diagnosing and monitoring exocrine
      pancreatic function in patients with cystic fibrosis.

      New functional testing of exocrine pancreatic function is superior to traditional testing
      with fecal elastase.

      MRI and ultrasound methods can give volume output estimate in cystic fibrosis patients.

      Contrast enhanced ultrasound can quantify reduced or delayed pancreatic perfusion and
      parenchymal changes in cystic fibrosis patients.

      Elastography/ CEUS can be used in prediction and monitoring of fibrosis development and
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the liver of cystic fibrosis patients.

      Immunohistochemical quantification of secretin/ cholecystokinin (CCK) producing cell in
      duodenum can be utilized as a model hormonal signaling in cystic fibrosis patients with
      exocrine pancreatic function.

      Study design: Observational, cohort studies.

      Patient characterization: Age, gender, and Genetic status from electronical records.

      Exocrine function testing (EPF): Secretin stimulated ultrasound and short endoscopic secretin
      test (EST). Faecal Elastase.

      Study 1: Exocrine pancreatic function by duodenal bicarbonate/ Enzymes related to Genetics
      and F elastase.

      Study 2: Ultrasound parenchymal changes of the pancreas related to Genetics and EPF.

      Study 3/4: Pancreatic secretion by ultrasound, MRI and EST related to EPF Study 5; Perfusion
      of the pancreas by CEUS related to EPF
