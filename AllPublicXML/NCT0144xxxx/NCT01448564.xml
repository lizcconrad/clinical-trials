  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been used to minimize muscle fatigue in athletes and
      healthy subjects. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are susceptible
      to early muscle fatigue. The objective of this study is to assess the acute effects of LEDs
      on muscle function, exercise capacity, and cardiorespiratory responses during isometric and
      dynamic exercise in patients with COPD. This study will assess 30 patients with moderate to
      severe obstruction (FEV1 ≤ 70% predicted). Isometric and dynamic protocols will be conducted
      in two visits each, for a total of four visits a week a part. First, a venous blood sample
      will be taken from the patients. The isometric protocol will start with the determination of
      the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MIVC) to determine the workload (60% of MIVC)
      for the isometric endurance test (IET). Patients will be randomized to receive either the
      placebo or LED application. Immediately after finishing this procedure, the patients will
      carry out the IET until the limit of tolerance or until a 20% fall of strength is observed.
      After the test, another blood sample will be taken. In the other visit (one week later), the
      same order of procedures will be performed, except with the opposite (LED or placebo). For
      the dynamic protocol, the same procedures described above will be followed except with the
      maximal incremental cycle ergometer test used instead of the IET. The electromyography will
      be recorded during the isometric and dynamic protocols. Differences in muscle function,
      exercise capacity, and cardiorespiratory responses between the LED and placebo applications
      will be analyzed. The therapeutic effects of LED could minimize muscle fatigue in patients
      with COPD by increasing exercise tolerance.

    <description>Recently has been using the LED, known by its acronym in English LED (Light Emitting Diode), devices that are light-emitting non-coherent and monochromatic, having a longer wavelength (± 10 - 30 nm) compared to lasers. The difference between the fundamental radiation emitted by a laser and an LED is the coherence of the beam.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  35 patients will be selected (see sample calculation in Section 6) who have moderate
             to severe obstruction (FEV1 ≤ 70% predicted) and stable disease, as suggested by the
             absence of changes in medication in the last 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ischemic heart disease, recent surgery, neuro-muscular or orthopedic that limit the
             performance of the protocol.
