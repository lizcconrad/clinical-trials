  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women in the United States. There are a variety of
      treatment decisions that need to be made. This study has been developed after a review of the
      literature demonstrated that women with breast cancer are making decisions regarding complex
      therapy issues in a way that is not congruent with their decision-making control preference.

      Some patients want to be empowered with information so that they can actively participate in
      the decision making about their care; others want to rely on the recommendations made by the
      oncologist. This is important because patients who were not satisfied with their adjuvant
      treatment decision noted a negative effect on quality of life and self image. These patients
      had more difficulties with treatment side effects; including aches, hot flashes, pain, and
      mood alteration. In additions the Institute of Medicine recommended that patient centeredness
      be a key aim of health care organizations and that all patients be given the opportunity to
      exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them.

      It is hypothesized that women making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy who are supported
      to make decisions based on their preferred level of control will have positive psychological
      outcomes.

      This evidence based study has been developed after a review of the literature demonstrated
      that 14 - 58% of women with breast cancer are making decisions regarding complex therapy
      issues in a way that is not congruent with their decision-making control preference. Because
      of the prevalence of decision-making control preference incongruence and strong evidence that
      providing support for a woman's decision making control preference is related to quality of
      life measures, this study will test the implementation of a nursing intervention to support
      the decision making of women with breast cancer. Using sample randomization with assignment
      to one of two groups, this study will explore whether using Degner's Control Preference (DCP)
      Scale supports decision making control preferences in women who are making decisions about
      breast cancer treatment. Results of the study will guide implementation of sustainable
      evidence-based behavioral practices that can have significant effects on quality of care
      outcomes.

      This study will assess satisfaction with decision involvement, depression, and decision
      making distress in women with early stage breast cancer after a decision support intervention
      to support a woman's preferred decision control preference. It is hypothesized that a
      decision support intervention that consists of providing information from the Degner Control
      Preference (DCP) Scale to the provider and patient will have a positive effect on
      psychological outcomes (decision satisfaction, decision making distress, and depression) in
      women making decisions about breast cancer treatment. Testing the effect of the decision
      support intervention on decision satisfaction, decision making distress and depression will
      be measured using t-Tests.

      Patients with early stage breast cancer who are scheduled to have a medical oncology
      consultation, to decide an adjuvant therapy regimen, will be asked to participate.

      128 patients will be randomly assigned to a group in which the patient and their oncologist
      would know the patient's preferred level of decision making control (intervention group) or a
      group that would receive information about a balanced diet (attention control group). Two
      nurses on the research team will consent participants, participate in the intervention, and
      collect data through interviews. Post intervention interviews will occur within 24 hours of
      the intervention and 4 weeks later.

    <description>Satisfaction with Decision (SWD) scale: A 6 item tool with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1, &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5, &quot;strongly agree&quot;, will be used to evaluate the patient's satisfaction with decision involvement by phone within 24 hours following the consultation and repeated 4 weeks later. This instrument is based on the Satisfaction with Decision Instrument of Holmes-Rovner. The SWD scale performed reliability, Cronbach's alpha = 0.86</description>

The CSES-D 10 version has been used across multiple populations. It has been shown to have test-retest reliability of 0.80 in patients with GI cancer.</description>

    <description>A 15-item Likert scale ranging from total scores of 0 to 75 with levels of: 9-25 indicative of moderate adaptation difficulties and &gt; 26 is considered indicative of clinical adaptation difficulties.

    <description>At time 1, participants in the intervention group will be asked to complete the Decision Control Preference Scale.The range of decision control is measured by the Decision Control Preference (DCP) Scale. The scale is used to measure the preferred or actual role in decision making using five response statements: two represent an active or patient-controlled role, one a shared or collaborative role, and two represent a passive or provider-controlled role. The preferred level of decision making control will be known by the participant in the intervention group and the information given to the oncologist prior to the consultation regarding adjuvant therapy</description>
