  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PPI-668 is an antiviral agent (a hepatitis C NS5A inhibitor) that is being developed as a
      potential treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. This study is being done to assess the
      safety and tolerance of PPI-668 when given to healthy volunteers for up to 5 days (Part I of
      the study) and to hepatitis C patients for up to 3 days (Part II). In addition, the study
      will assess how much PPI-668 is absorbed into the bloodstream. In Part II, the effect of
      PPI-668 on the amount of hepatitis C virus in patients' bloodstream (serum HCV RNA levels)
      also will be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        In order to participate in the study, volunteers for Part I and patients for Part II must
        meet all of the following key entry criteria, as well as other entry criteria specified in
        the full protocol:

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female, between 18 and 65 years of age. Female patients must be surgically
             sterile or two years post-menopausal.

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) 18 - 35 kg/m2

          3. In good health, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator

          4. Able and willing to comply with all protocol requirements and to sign an informed
             consent.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Seropositive for HIV antibody, or HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) at Screen. Volunteer
             subjects for Part I must also be negative for HCV antibody.

          2. Any medical condition that may interfere with the absorption, distribution or
             elimination of study drug (PPI-668), or with the clinical and laboratory assessments

               -  Serum albumin &lt; 3.4 g/dL.
