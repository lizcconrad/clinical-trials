    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to investigate whether the rise in childhood obesity is caused by
      the loss of recurrent and chronic infections in modern, industrialized society, beginning in
      utero and extending through early childhood. The investigators will also examine whether the
      antimicrobial triclosan, present in numerous cleaning and hygiene products, decreases the
      incidence of infection within a household.

    <description>An intervention is nested within the observational cohort study as a secondary outcome. Commercially available household and personal cleaning products that either do not contain triclosan or that may contain triclosan will be delivered to the household every 4 months for the duration of the study. All cleaning products will be formulated, packaged and labeled by the original manufacturer with no modification for this study. Use of these products will be as per each individual product's label and at the discretion of the participant.</description>

        The study population will be enrolled from the population of pregnant women attending
        obstetric clinics for the first antenatal visit. Each woman will be followed throughout her
        pregnancy and then she and her baby will be followed over the first three years of the
        baby's life (and more if possible).

             for the mother, medical history and infectious and other conditions during pregnancy,
             and for the infant, Apgar scores, height and weight measurements at birth and over

          5. History of diagnosis and/or treatment, and any current diagnosis or treatment, of a
             thyroid disorder or other endocrine condition.

          6. History of diagnosis and/or treatment, and any current diagnosis or treatment that has
             resulted in severe immunosuppression.

          7. A household member who has a compromised immune system

          8. Other conditions that in the opinion of the PI would make the subject an unacceptable
