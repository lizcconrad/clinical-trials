  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed is the primary cause of autumn allergies. The ragweed season begins in mid-August. In
      the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys54.3% of the population had
      positive test responses to one or more allergens, with the prevalence for short ragweed being
      26.2%

      The purpose of this observational follow-on study is to further evaluate rhinoconjunctivitis
      symptoms on exposure to ragweed allergen in the EEC among subjects who completed all dosing
      visits and the post treatment challenge (PTC) visit in study TR002 approximately one year
      after the start of treatment.

      Subjects who were randomised in study TR002 and who completed all dosing visits and the PTC
      will be invited to attend the Screening Visit for TR002B. Subjects will attend the EEC for 4
      visits on successive days. Following the final EEC visit a follow-up visit will be performed
      3-10 days later.
