    <textblock>
      Rationale: In Canada, as in most industrialized countries, Alzheimer's disease and other
      related dementia are increasingly prevalent in older people. At an advanced stage,
      institutionalization in a long-term care (LTC) setting will be the fate of a majority of
      patients. A structured palliative care approach is increasingly used for cancer patients, but
      is still rarely accessible in LTC institutions for older people with advanced or terminal
      dementia. This approach should include a more systematic detection and treatment of pain and
      other physical and psychological symptoms during the last weeks of life, as well as better
      communications between patients, families and care staff, particularly relating to advanced
      care directives. Objectives: The general objective of this study is to implement and evaluate
      a multidisciplinary and multidimensional program of palliative and end-of-life care for older
      persons with terminal dementia in LTC facilities. Methodology: The intervention program will
      include five components:

        1. daily involvement of a nurse from the regular staff in the LTC facility as a change
           agent;

        2. awareness sessions with administrators and staff on the importance of high quality
           palliative care in dementia;

        3. a training program for physicians and all the staff involved in direct care of patients;

        4. systematic discussions with families and distribution to families of a document on
           different aspects of palliative care in dementia;

        5. systematic clinical care by regular staff for the control of pain, respiratory symptoms
           and mouth care. The program will be implemented in two LTC settings (one in Quebec City
           and one in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada), and results will be compared with the LTC
           control settings where usual care will be applied without implementation of the program.
