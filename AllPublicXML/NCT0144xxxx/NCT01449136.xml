  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental materials with antibacterial properties can prevent the harmful effects caused by oral
      cariogenic bacteria. This double-blind controlled clinical trial evaluated the performance of
      antibacterial cement for sealing infected dentin in atraumatic restorations of primary
      molars.

      The study enrolled 45 children (45 teeth) between 5 and 8 years of age, of both genders,
      divided into two groups. In group A (GA; n=22), the cavities were lined with conventional
      glass ionomer cement (Vidrion F®) and in group B (GB; n=23), with antibacterial cement
      (Vidrion F® containing 1% each of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefaclor). Both groups
      were restored with Ketac Molar Easymix®. Molars with carious lesions on the inner half of
      dentin without clinical or radiographic pulp damage were selected. Patients were evaluated
      clinically (for pain, fistulas, or mobility) and radiographically (area of caries, periapical
      region, and furcation of teeth) after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

    <description>The absence of pain, fistulas, and mobility throughout the study was considered clinical success and the decreased or unchanged area of caries (obtained by a software to accurately measure distances between anatomical points selected by the operator of radiolucent zone beneath the restoration) and no bone or dental disorder was detected was considered radiographic success.
Overall success was defined as clinical and radiographic success being achieved simultaneously.</description>
