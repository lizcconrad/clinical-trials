  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery including hypothermic cardiac arrest (HCA) commonly involves perioperative
      transfusion of allogeneic blood products which is associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality. In this retrospective analysis, the investigator aimed to evaluate the effect of a
      thromboelastometry-guided treatment algorithm promoting fibrinogen concentrate as first line
      hemostatic agent on the perioperative use of allogeneic blood products.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will analyze the data of patients undergoing elective and emergent surgical
      procedures involving the ascendent aorta and/or the aortic arch with the help of HCA from
      January 2009 to June 2011.

      The investigators will collect and document baseline characteristics, the use of
      thromboelastometry, thromboelastometric data, and perioperative laboratory data. In addition,
      the investigators will evaluate perioperative bleeding from mediastinal drainages,
      perioperative use of blood and hemostatic products, and the adverse events within the
      hospitalisation including re-exploration, renal impairment, myocardial infarction, severe
      brain injury, and death.
