  <brief_title>Study of Biostate for Treatment of Children With Hemophilia A Complicated by Antibody Development</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Multicentre, Interventional, Non-randomized, Open-label, Single-group Phase III Study to Evaluate Plasma-Derived Antihaemophilic Factor/Von Willebrand Factor Concentrate (Biostate®) for Immune Tolerance Induction in Male Paediatric Subjects With Haemophilia A (≤ 2%) Who Have Developed High-titre Antibodies to Factor VIII (Factor VIII Inhibitors)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to investigate how well Biostate works in treatment of male patients
      below the age of 12 years who have a clotting factor deficiency that is aggravated by the
      development of antibodies. The antibodies are directed against the clotting factor that is
      given for replacement therapy and usually make therapy unsuccessful. The treatment used in
      this study is called immune tolerance therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects diagnosed with haemophilia A (≤ 2% FVIII level in the absence of factor
             replacement, according to their medical history).

          -  Age 28 days to &lt;12 years.

          -  Subject is eligible for immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has received ITI previously.

          -  Subjects with a historical peak inhibitor titre of ≥ 200 BU/mL.

          -  Concomitant treatment with drugs with immunosuppressive side effects (eg, systemic
             corticosteroids), azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, high dose immunoglobulin or the use
             of a protein A column or plasmapheresis and interferons.

          -  High risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other thromboembolic events
             (excluding catheter thrombosis) as judged by the investigator.

          -  Subjects who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2 positive (as reported
             in the medical records or determined at screening).
