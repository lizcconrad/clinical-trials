  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing physical activity continues to be a challenge among many individuals, particularly
      those who are overweight. Recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
      Survey (NHANES) showed that individuals who reported engaging in a variety of activities were
      more likely to meet national physical activity recommendations compared to those who reported
      no variety. Incorporating a variety of activities into a physical activity program may be a
      way to increase physical increase physical activity levels.

      One method to increase variety in physical activities is to use active videogames. Videogames
      that use motion sensors allow a gamer to physically perform a variety of activities. Thus,
      the purpose ot this laboratory-based investigation is to conduct a study to examine the
      effect of engaging in a greater variety of active videogames on energy expenditure in 30
      non-obese, regularly active adults.

      Thirty men and women, aged 18- to 35- years, recruited from the local area, with a normal
      body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m, will participate in two experimental
      sessions, VARIETY and NON-VARIETY, with order of experimental sessions counterbalanced across
      participants. Participants will be assessed on liking of the active videogames, energy,
      tiredness, motivation, to succeed, interest in the games, and energy expenditure during the
      experimental sessions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, ages 18-25 years are eligible to participate. They will be recruited
             from flyers posted around campus and in local gyms, and must be willing to
             participate. They must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have never played an active videogame or are unable to play an active
             videogame. If the participant dislikes (scoring &lt;50 on a 100 mm visual analogue scale
             [VAS]) playing the active videogames used in the investigation. Or if the participant
             engages in less than 150 minutes/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical
             activity over the previous month.
