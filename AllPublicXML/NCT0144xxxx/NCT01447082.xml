    <textblock>
      The main objective of this observational study is to characterize new users of quetiapine XR
      as well as new users of other study drugs (i.e. the comparison group) and to quantify the
      risk of developing newly diagnosed outcomes of interest in new users of quetiapine XR as well
      as in other study drugs.
