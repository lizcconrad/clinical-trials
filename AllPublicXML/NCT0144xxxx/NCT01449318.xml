  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to prove that pain scores generated from painful stimuli applied
      preoperatively may help identify the inter-individual variability in pain perception.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychological factors and experimental pain models such as as electrical, pressure, heat, or
      cold stimuli have been identified as predictors of pain intensity and opioid consumption
      postoperatively. This study will investigate, in addition to the factors described above, the
      ability of pain scores generated from painful stimuli postoperatively in predicting
      postoperative pain.

    <description>Thermal stimuli will be administered to the ventral surface of the dominant forearm and then to the lower abdomen (surgical site)using the Thermal Sensory Analyser. Each thermal testing trial will be separated by approximately 2 min and at a separate site.
To measure the thermal pain threshold temperature, The thermode will be applied to the ventral surface of the dominant forearm and the temperature will be increased at 1°C/s from 35 to 50°C.
To measure the Suprathreshold Thermal Pain Intensity and unpleasantness, Stimulus responses for noxious heat stimuli will be performed by applying phasic heat stimuli at 8 different temperatures (35, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, and 49°C).</description>
