      The primary objectives are to determine feasibility and the acute toxicity profile of proton
      therapy with concurrent continuous infusion 5-FU chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are to
      determine late toxicities and to generate preliminary data on clinical efficacy.

      This protocol invites patients with cancer of the upper digestive tract who will receive
      simultaneous proton radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to use a
      newer form of radiation therapy called proton radiation and to determine if its use is safe
      and effective in people with this type of cancer. Doctors will assess the safety of this
      method of treatment, record the side effects participants experience while receiving the
      standard dose of proton radiation.
