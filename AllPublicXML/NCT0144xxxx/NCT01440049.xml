    <textblock>
      On a population of patients followed by an office-based cardiologist and treated with
      eplerenone, the objectives of the survey are:

        -  To describe the characteristics of the population treated.

        -  To describe the methods of use of eplerenone (posology, duration of treatment, medicinal
           combinations).

        -  To describe the follow-up methods of the treatment.

        -  To describe the possible interruptions of the treatment

  <detailed_description>

      A sample size in the region of N = 400 patients will allow this accuracy of estimation, as
      for this size, the half-width would be equal to 5% for a frequency of 50% corresponding to a
      confidence interval of maximum width. In view of the type of survey and the need for 12
      months of monitoring in the context of standard practice, it may be anticipated that the
      drop-off rate will be about 20%. A sample size of N = 500 patients was therefore chosen.

        <title>Systolic Ejection Fraction as a Measure of Left Ventricular Dysfunction at Inclusion for Safety Analysis Set (SAS) Population</title>
        <description>Left ventricular dysfunction, a condition in which the left ventricle of the heart exhibits a decreased functionality, was assessed based on systolic ejection fraction. Systolic ejection fraction was the fraction of the end-diastolic volume (EDV) that was ejected out of left ventricle with each contraction.</description>

        <population>SAS population included all participants who received study medication. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) is signifying those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>
