  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ofatumumab can help to control CLL.
      The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Ofatumumab is designed to bind to the surface of the leukemia cells . This may cause the
      leukemia cells to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive ofatumumab by
      vein every week for 4 weeks. After that, you will receive it every month. Each infusion will
      last about 4 hours.

      Before you receive ofatumumab, you will be given drugs to help reduce the risk of side
      effects.

        -  You will take Tylenol (acetaminophen) by mouth.

        -  You will receive diphenhydramine by vein over about 5 minutes.

        -  You will receive a steroid by vein over about 5 minutes.

        -  You will take allopurinol by mouth during the first 14 days of treatment.

      Study Visits:

      Every other week, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every month, you will have a physical exam. If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will also
      have a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      After Month 6 and every 6 months after that, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and
      aspiration to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue receive the study drug for up to 12 months. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      This is an investigational study. Ofatumumab is FDA approved for the treatment of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia that has relapsed. Its use in this study for initial treatment of CLL is
      investigational.

      Up to 34 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia requiring treatment age &gt;65 at the time of
             signing informed consent.

          2. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/World Health Organization (WHO)
             performance status of 2-3.or patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia requiring
             treatment age &gt;65 years at the time of signing informed consent and ECOG/WHO
             performance status of 0-1 and a CIRS or Charlson co-morbidity score of 2 or higher.

          3. Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine &lt;2mg/dL and eGFR more than
             30cc/minute, bilirubin &lt;2mg/dL). Patients with renal or liver dysfunction due to organ
             infiltration by lymphocytes may be eligible after discussion with the study chairman.
             Patients with Gilbert's syndrome are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with documented prolymphocytic leukemia (prolymphocytes more than 55% in the
             blood).

          2. Known positivity for HIV.

          3. Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. In addition, if negative for
             HGsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HB DNA test will be performed
             and if positive the subject will be excluded.

          4. Prior treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

          5. Concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy, including other monoclonal
             antibodies. Localized radiotherapy to an area not compromising bone marrow function
             does not apply. Patients with malignancies with indolent behavior such as prostate
             cancer treated with radiation or surgery can be enrolled in the study as long as they
             have a reasonable expectation to have been cured with the treatment modality received.

          6. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          7. Any known hypersensitivity to ofatumumab or its components.
