  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major personal and social burden, being the commonest cause of severe adult
      disability. Recovery has been shown in animal models to be dependent upon adequate levels of
      acetylcholine within the brain - which in stroke is likely to be deficient. This is because
      acetylcholine-producing nerve cells in the brain are often damaged by strokes. Consequently,
      the investigators hypothesise that recovery may be improved by boosting acetylcholine levels
      in the brain - that can be readily achieved by treating with donepezil.

      AIMS: To establish: 1) whether motor deficits in acute stroke improve more in patients taking
      donepezil, relative to placebo, for 12 weeks; 2) whether brain functional MRI changes as a
      result of donepezil after 12 weeks.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with acute stroke diagnosed on clinical and neuroimaging grounds
             who can enter the trial within the 1st week of stroke onset, and who have new motor
             dysfunction of an upper limb. Motor impairment should be moderate - severe (UE-FM
             Score â‰¤50 out of a total of 66).

          2. Age: above 18 years old.

          3. Patients able and willing to partake in motor tests, and to return for follow-up visit
             at 12 weeks.

          4. Able to understand English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications for donepezil: pregnancy (* Female patients &lt;50 years old will be
             asked if there is any possibility that they might be pregnant. If there is any
             uncertainty, or a likelihood that they are pregnant, this will qualify as an exclusion
             criterion)*; moderate - severe asthma (i.e. regular treatment prescribed for this);
             bradycardia, syncope, 2nd or 3rd degree heart block, acute or decompensated heart
             failure; peptic ulcer diagnosed endoscopically and on treatment for this; epilepsy;
             Parkinson's disease; end-stage renal failure or creatinine &gt; 300 micromol/l;
             genitourinary tract or gastrointestinal tract obstruction; gastrointestinal tract
             hemorrhage; myasthenia gravis

          2. Other: functionally-significant cognitive impairment (i.e. dementia); significant
             receptive aphasia (i.e. such that cannot understand purpose or details of trial, and
             will be unable to cooperate with task instructions); significant physical infirmity as
             judged by treating physician (e.g. severe organ failure; terminal cancer).

          3. Contraindications for MRI (this only pertains for the subset of patients entering the
             MRI substudy, but is not a contra-indication to the main study providing a diagnosis
             of stroke is clear from CT): phobia, metal implants including pacemaker.
