  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute, severe lateral ankle sprains are estimated to comprise between 3-5% of emergency
      department visits and are the most common musculoskeletal injury in the physically active
      population. Although the current accepted treatment of ankle sprains is to encourage early
      mobilization with functional rehabilitation, there is little high-quality evidence directing
      this clinical practice.

      This pilot study is to:

        -  provide quantitative data for estimation of mean outcome scores and standard deviations
           to allow subsequent sample size calculations

        -  evaluate the feasibility of the proposed study design

        -  assess patient enrollment issues specific to randomization into an active rehabilitation
           program compared to below knee immobilization.
