  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label, pilot study of palliative radiation therapy (RT)
      combined with ipilimumab in patients with stage IV melanoma. The primary objective of this
      study is to assess the safety of combining ipilimumab with palliative RT in patients with
      Stage IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are a) to assess the induction of anti-melanoma
      immune responses using laboratory correlative studies of T cell responses to melanoma
      antigens, and b) to compare tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated
      sites with responses in patients with Stage IV disease treated with ipilimumab alone on
      expanded access study CA184045. In this study, ipilimumab will be administered as recently
      approved by the FDA (3 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments). Palliative RT
      will start within 2 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Patients will be seen at least every
      12 weeks for follow-up following completion of ipilimumab therapy until progression of
      disease by imaging criteria or increased symptomatology that requires another therapy. A
      total of 20 patients with previously treated unresectable metastatic melanoma requiring
      palliative radiation therapy will be treated on this pilot study over approximately 18
      months. All subjects who receive study drug will be monitored for safety. Relevant tumor
      imaging studies will be obtained at baseline, 2-4 weeks following the 4th/last dose of
      ipilimumab, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. This study will provide the
      safety data (and possibly early efficacy signals) needed to proceed with a randomized Phase
      II study for proof of principle. If compelling data is obtained supporting this IT + RT
      vaccine strategy, this approach will be extended to other solid tumor types.

                  after the last dose of investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of
                  pregnancy is minimized.

               -  WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has undergone
                  successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as:

                    -  Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or

                    -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and on hormone replacement
                       therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;
                       35 mIU/mL

               -  Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
                  products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical
                  products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms,

                  partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing
                  potential. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum
                  sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the
                  start of investigational product.

                  c) Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception
                  to avoid conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last
                  dose of investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
                  minimized.

          2. Target Disease Exceptions

               -  Subjects on any other systemic therapy for cancer, including any other
                  experimental treatment.

               -  Prior treatment with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody if treatment failure was due to
                  adverse events (AEs). If a subject was discontinued from the prior anti-CTLA-4
                  treatment due to an AE or serious adverse event (SAE), regardless of the type of
                  event, that discontinuation constitutes an exclusion criterion. If AEs were
                  serious enough to require a subject's withdrawal from prior treatment, the
                  subject should be excluded from this study.

               -  A history of AEs with prior IL-2 or Interferon will not preclude subjects from
                  entering the current study.

               -  Subjects who relapsed in study MDX010-16 are not eligible for this study.

          3. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

               -  Autoimmune disease: subjects with a documented history of inflammatory bowel
                  disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are excluded from this
                  study as are subjects with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid
                  arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma]; systemic lupus
                  erythematosus (SLE); autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]).
                  Subjects with motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (eg,
                  Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis) are excluded from this study.

               -  Any subject who has a life-threatening condition that requires high-dose
                  immunosuppressant(s)

               -  Presence of known Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection, regardless of control on
                  antiviral therapy

               -  Subjects with melanoma who have another active, concurrent, malignant disease are
                  not eligible for the CA184045 study, with the exception of subjects with
                  adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder
                  cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          4. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

               -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
                  physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.

               -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, could make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or could
                  obscure the interpretation of adverse events.

               -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases for
                  up to 4 weeks before or after any dose of ipilimumab, with the exceptions of
                  amantadine and flumadine.

               -  Central nervous system (CNS) metastases that require palliative radiation
                  therapy; prior brain irradiation is allowed providing CNS disease is stable.

          5. Additional Concomitant Treatments

               -  Any investigational agents

               -  Any other (non-CA184045 related) CTLA-4 inhibitors or agonists

               -  CD137 agonists

               -  Immunosuppressive agents (unless required for treating potential AEs)

               -  Chronic systemic corticosteroids (unless required for treating treatment emergent
                  AEs or required for management of signs or symptoms due to brain metastases, upon
                  discussion with BMS medical monitor).

        Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of
        the study subjects and to ensure that the results of the study can be used. It is
        imperative that subjects fully meet all eligibility criteria.

          <description>Ipilimumab (BMS-734016, MDX010, MDX-CTLA4, Yervoy) will be administered as standard of care with base dose of 3 mg/kg iv over approximately 90 minutes every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments. Palliative radiation therapy to 1-2 sites of disease will start within 5 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Subjects will have follow up visits 2-4 weeks after the last ipilimumab dose and then every 3 months (±2 weeks) thereafter until progression of disease.
