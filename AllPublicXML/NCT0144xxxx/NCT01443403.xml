    <description>Participants completed a daily Bowel Movement and Constipation Assessment Diary to record information about bowel movements and constipation.
A spontaneous bowel movement was defined as a bowel movement unassisted by rescue medication (laxative or enema) taken within the 24 hours preceding the bowel movement. Baseline was defined as the average number of SBMs per week during the 2 weeks prior to randomization. The number of SBMs per week in the last 2 weeks of treatment is defined as the average number of SBMs per week recorded in the diary for the 14 days prior to the last dose of study drug.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 53 clinical sites in the United States. The first participant was enrolled on August 17, 2011 and the last participant completed on August 22, 2012.
Participants must have met eligibility criteria and completed the Bowel Movement and Constipation Assessment (BMCA) Diary for a minimum of 14 days to enroll in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, naldemedine 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, or 0.4 mg once daily.
One participant was randomized twice, first to placebo and subsequently to naldemedine 0.4 mg, and is counted in both arms below and for safety analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Participants completed a daily Bowel Movement and Constipation Assessment Diary to record information about bowel movements and constipation.
A spontaneous bowel movement was defined as a bowel movement unassisted by rescue medication (laxative or enema) taken within the 24 hours preceding the bowel movement. Baseline was defined as the average number of SBMs per week during the 2 weeks prior to randomization. The number of SBMs per week in the last 2 weeks of treatment is defined as the average number of SBMs per week recorded in the diary for the 14 days prior to the last dose of study drug.</description>
