    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitic syndrome with coronary tropism.

      It has been reported worldwide, but it is ten times more common in Asian population. The
      annual incidence in children under 5 years in Europe is estimated at 8 to 100000. It is the
      second vasculitis of the child by its frequency after rheumatoid purpura. It occurs in 80% of
      cases between 1 and 5 years, with a maximal incidence around the age of 12 months.

      It may results in acquired heart disease in children in developed countries, and may be the
      cause of premature coronary artery disease in adulthood.

      A polymorphism was recently associated with the occurrence of disease in a Japanese and U.S
      population. (C allele of SNP itpkc_3, with a risk multiplied by 2). However, data are
      conflicting on this issue and the prevalence of this allel is unknown in North America and
      Europe populations.

      The clinical picture of KD associate a persistent fever and an antipyretics resistance with
      mucocutaneous signs and bulky cervical lymphadenopathy usually unilateral. Diagnosis is
      confirmed by the presence of five clinical signs (major criteria). The presence of
      inconsistent coronary lesions in cardiac ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis.

      KD can resolve spontaneously with no treatment. The severity of the disease is primarily
      related to complications of coronary aneurysms in acute or chronic stages.

      Several arguments support the fact that adult patients have diffuse vascular lesions
      different from aneurysmal lesions initially described in childhood.

      Despite abundance of publications on KD, there is no prospective or retrospective study which
      explored anomalies resulting from KD in adult subjects.

      Therefore, this project will describe the patient's vascular evolution, the prevalence of
      atherosclerotic lesions and to determine the biological and functional abnormalities, markers
      of accelerated atherosclerosis.

      Hypothesis : A history of Kawasaki disease represents a cardiovascular risk factor in
      adulthood.

      The main objective is to evaluate the prevalence of atherosclerotic lesions, their extent and
      their severity in adults with a history of KD in childhood compared to a control population.
