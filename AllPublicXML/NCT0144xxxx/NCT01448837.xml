      The primary objective of this crossover 24-hour Intraocular Pressure (IOP) trial is to
      compare the control obtained after 3 months of therapy with the bimatoprost/timolol fixed
      combination (BTFC, Ganfort) given once in the evening (20:00) versus latanoprost (Xalatan)
      administered once in the evening (20:00) in newly-diagnosed patients with exfoliation
      syndrome (XFS) and ocular hypertension, or exfoliative glaucoma (XFG) previously untreated
      and IOP greater than 29 mm Hg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has exfoliation syndrome with ocular hypertension, or exfoliative glaucoma and
             is older than 29 years

          -  Patient is newly diagnosed, or currently untreated and exhibits untreated morning IOP
             (2 separate IOP readings at 10:00)greater than 29 mm Hg in the study eye

          -  Study patients should have mild to moderate exfoliative glaucoma (VF loss &lt;12 dB;
             cupping 0.8 or less)

          -  Patient with exfoliation syndrome should fulfill the IOP criterion (IOP &gt; 29 mm Hg at
             10:00)

          -  Patient deemed by investigator to require significant IOP reduction to obtain desired
             target IOP

          -  Patient agrees to be treated for at least 3 months with latanoprost and
             bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination drops dosed in the evening

          -  In study eye distance best corrected Snelen visual acuity greater than 1/10

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to therapy with latanoprost, bimatoprost, or Î²-blockers

          -  History of non-adherence or previously recorded evidence of lack of response (&lt;10%
             morning IOP reduction) to any antiglaucoma medication

          -  Patient can not understand the instructions and adhere to medications

          -  Patient is a female of childbearing potential or lactating mother

          -  Past history of trauma, inflammation, surgery, past use of steroids (within 2 months),
             severe dry eyes and use of contact lenses

          -  Signs of ocular infection, except blepharitis, or corneal abnormality that may affect
             IOP measurements

          -  The other eye can not receive the same therapy, or remain without medical therapy

          -  Closed angles
