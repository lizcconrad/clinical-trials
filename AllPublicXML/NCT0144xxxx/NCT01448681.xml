  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is statistically significant correlation between invasive measures of intracranial
      pressure (ICP) and non-invasive, real-time, continuous physiologic waveform data algorithms
      to predict ICP. Furthermore, characteristics within this physiologic waveform data will allow
      modeling for trend prediction of derived ICP information. Specific aims:

        1. Develop models to estimate ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) after traumatic
           brain injury in humans.

        2. Predict and anticipate changes in ICP for preemptive management purposes.

        3. Analyze characteristics of changes in ICP after treatment failure.

        4. Analyze data to predict/anticipate confounding physiologic factors that affect ICP and
           its treatment.

        5. Test the resulting models in real time.
