      While cognitive therapy and exposure therapy are both proven to be effective for panic
      disorder and/or agoraphobia when outcome is assenssed up to one year after treatment (Gould
      et al., 1995) the scientific knowledge about long-term course of these disorders is still
      scanty. Although several long-term outcome studies have been conducted, the quality of these
      studies has been questioned.

      The aim is to conduct a follow-up study of patients with either panic disorder with history
      of agoraphobia or agoraphobia without history of panic disorder. the patients were treated in
      a group format at Modum Bad during the years 1989 to 1997. Four subsamples will be included
      in the study. Subsample 1 (76 patients treated in 1989 and 1990) received combined cognitive
      and psychodynamic treatment. Subsample 2 and 3 (46 patients treated in 1992 - 1993) were
      allocated to either cognitive therapy or guided mastery treatment. Subsample 4 (45 patients
      treated in 1994 - 1996) received cognitive and schema focused therapy.

      In the follow-up study the participants will be requested to complete the same self report
      measures as they completed at intake, discharge and at previous follow-up times. the
      participants will also be interviewed using the SCID-I and II as they were at the previous
      assessments.

      The present sample is relatively unique in having received pure psychosocial experimental
      treatments. The very long term efficacy of cognitive therapy relative to behavioural
      treatmetns for agoraphobia can be evaluated, and the potential moderating effects of
      personality disorders can be assessed.
