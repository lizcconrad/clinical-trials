  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CT-011 is an investigational monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of drug
      that are known to target specific cells (in this case, cells in the immune system) The DC RCC
      Vaccine is agent that tries to help the immune system to recognize and fight against cancer
      cells.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of CT-011 alone, and in
      combination with the Dendritic Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (DC RCC) vaccine. The investigators
      are also trying to find out what effect the combination has on the disease, and on your
      immune system.

      This study is divided into 2 groups. The first 22 subjects will be in Group 1 and will
      receive CT-011 only. The next 22 subjects will be in Group 2 and will receive CT-011 and the
      DC RCC vaccine.

      Group 1: Subjects in this cohort are not required to have tumor resection (nephrectomy) to
      participate in this study. For subjects who are undergoing nephrectomy and for subjects
      undergoing resection for another metastasis, infusions of CT-011 will begin 21 to 35 days
      post-surgery. Subjects will receive 4 cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose
      of CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28 intravenously.

      For subjects who are not undergoing nephrectomy for standard of care therapy, infusions of
      CT-011 will begin 21 to 28 days following registration on the study. Subjects will receive a
      total of four cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of CT-011 given on days
      1, 14, and 28 intravenously.

      Group 2: Subjects in this cohort will have chosen to undergo a &quot;debulking nephrectomy&quot;
      (surgery to remove a tumor of the kidney, but not all of the cancer cells in your body) as a
      standard treatment for kidney cancer or have tumor lesions that are accessible (may be
      removed without major surgery) and are being removed to treat or diagnose their cancer. All
      subjects in this group will receive infusions of CT-011 21 to 35 days following tumor
      resection.

      Subjects will receive a total of 4 cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of
      CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28. In addition they will receive a vaccination of the DC RCC
      vaccine on day 8 of each cycle.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, (with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm), or the appearance of new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.&quot;</description>

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, (with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm), or the appearance of new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.&quot;</description>
