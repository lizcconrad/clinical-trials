      The purpose of this study is to clarify the impact of rituximab on clinical outcomes in
      patients with primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and also to investigate the role
      of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy using methotrexate for reducing central nervous
      system (CNS) recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. A significant risk of contralateral breast involvement and a tendency for central
      nervous system (CNS) progression have been identified in previous studies. Optimal treatment
      strategies for primary breast DLBCL have remained undefined, although the combination of
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be considered to be the best treatment
      option in these studies. However, despite the administration of aggressive treatment,
      prognosis is still poor, even in localized disease, with 5-year progression-free survival
      rates of approximately 50% to 65% in most series. Therefore, other therapeutic options must
      be explored.

      During the last decade, several studies have shown that rituximab plus CHOP or CHOP-like
      chemotherapy significantly improves clinical outcomes of patients with DLBCL. However, the
      relevance of rituximab in the management of this rare extranodal lymphoma has never been
      studied. Moreover, several studies have also suggested the possibility that prophylactic
      intrathecal chemotherapy might be effective in reducing CNS recurrence.

      Thus, this trial is designed to prospectively evaluate the treatment strategy, which
      addressed the safety and efficacy of a combined therapy that included R-CHOP21 and
      prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy using methotrexate.
