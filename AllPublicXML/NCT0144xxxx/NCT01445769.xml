  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an alternative dosing strategy of
      ruxolitinib in subjects with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia
      vera-myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) and post essential thrombocythemia-myelofibrosis (PET-MF) in
      order to minimize the development of anemia and thrombocytopenia.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study was designed to explore an alternative dosing approach with the purpose of
      reducing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Subjects began dosing at 10 mg bid and had the
      opportunity for dose increases based on assessments of efficacy and overall hematologic
      status in a defined prior dosing interval. Dose increases were restricted to those patients
      who did not meet criteria for or have a dose hold over the prior 6 weeks, had a platelet
      count ≥100 x 10^9/L at week 12 or ≥150 x 10^9/L at week 18, and had a self-reported Patient's
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score of 3 (minimally improved) to 7 (very much worse) OR
      the subject's palpable spleen length below the costal margin had been reduced by less than
      40% at that visit relative to Baseline. Dose increases were elective and not required.
      Subjects were permitted a dose increase of 5 mg BID to 15 mg BID at Week 12 and to a maximum
      of 20 mg BID at Week 18. There were also protocol-required dose decreases for
      thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;100 x 10^9/L) or protocol-defined anemia (decline in hemoglobin
      of at least 2 g/dL to a level &lt; 8 g/dL, development of transfusion dependence, or a 50%
      increase in transfusion requirements for transfusion dependent subjects).This approach
      assumed that beginning at a low dose for initial therapy might have a positive impact on the
      rate of the initial hemoglobin decline and the nadir by decreasing the level of JAK-mediated
      inhibition of hematopoiesis. Specific dose modifications were described to minimize
      excursions of hemoglobin levels into the Grade 3 or Grade 4 range.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Spleen volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. The MRIs were read in the central imaging laboratory. Spleen volume was obtained by outlining the circumference of the organ and determining the volume using the technique of least squares. MRI was the preferred method for obtaining spleen volume data. CT scans were performed if the participant was not a candidate for MRI. The CT scans were processed by the same central laboratory used for MRIs. The same method (MRI or CT) was used for all visits for a given participant unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurred.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a symptom diary, the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF v2.0). Participants were issued a hand-held device to record answers to queries regarding 7 symptoms of myelofibrosis each night from Baseline through Week 24. Symptoms assessed included night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left, feeling of fullness (early satiety), muscle/bone pain, and inactivity. The daily total symptom score (TSS) was the sum of the first 6 individual symptom scores (each on a scale of 0-10). Inactivity was not included in the total score. The Baseline TSS was the mean of daily total symptom scores from the last 7 consecutive days prior to the first study dose and ranged from 0 to 60. The Week 24 TSS was the mean of the daily total symptom scores from the last 28 consecutive days prior to the Week 24 visit and ranged from 0 to 60. A higher score indicates worse symptoms. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>Participants initially received ruxolitinib 10 mg twice a day (bid). Dose increases of 5 mg bid were permitted at Weeks 12 and 18 for subjects who did not meet criteria for or have a dose hold over the prior 6 weeks, had a platelet count ≥100 x 10^9/L at week 12 or ≥150 x 10^9/L at week 18, and had a self-reported Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score of 3 (minimally improved) to 7 (very much worse) OR the subject's palpable spleen length had been reduced by less than 40% at that visit relative to Baseline. The maximum dose was 15 mg BID at Week 12 and 20 mg bid at Week 18. There were also protocol-required dose decreases for protocol-defined anemia and thrombocytopenia.</description>

        <title>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in Spleen Volume at Week 24</title>
        <description>Spleen volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. The MRIs were read in the central imaging laboratory. Spleen volume was obtained by outlining the circumference of the organ and determining the volume using the technique of least squares. MRI was the preferred method for obtaining spleen volume data. CT scans were performed if the participant was not a candidate for MRI. The CT scans were processed by the same central laboratory used for MRIs. The same method (MRI or CT) was used for all visits for a given participant unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurred.</description>

        <title>Mean Percentage Change From Baseline in the Total Symptom Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a symptom diary, the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF v2.0). Participants were issued a hand-held device to record answers to queries regarding 7 symptoms of myelofibrosis each night from Baseline through Week 24. Symptoms assessed included night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left, feeling of fullness (early satiety), muscle/bone pain, and inactivity. The daily total symptom score (TSS) was the sum of the first 6 individual symptom scores (each on a scale of 0-10). Inactivity was not included in the total score. The Baseline TSS was the mean of daily total symptom scores from the last 7 consecutive days prior to the first study dose and ranged from 0 to 60. The Week 24 TSS was the mean of the daily total symptom scores from the last 28 consecutive days prior to the Week 24 visit and ranged from 0 to 60. A higher score indicates worse symptoms. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

Dose increases of 5 mg bid were permitted at Weeks 12 and 18 for subjects who did not meet criteria for or have a dose hold over the prior 6 weeks, had a platelet count ≥100 x 10^9/L at week 12 or ≥150 x 10^9/L at week 18, and had a self-reported PGIC score of 3 (minimally improved) to 7 (very much worse) OR the subject's palpable spleen length had been reduced by less than 40% at that visit relative to Baseline. The maximum dose was 15 mg BID at Week 12 and 20 mg bid at Week 18. There were also protocol-required dose decreases for protocol-defined anemia and thrombocytopenia.</description>

          <title>Median Percent Change From Baseline in the Total Symptom Score at Week 24</title>
          <description>Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a symptom diary, the modified MFSAF v2.0. Participants were issued a hand-held device to record answers to queries regarding 7 symptoms of myelofibrosis each night from Baseline through Week 24. Symptoms assessed included night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left, feeling of fullness (early satiety), muscle/bone pain, and inactivity. The daily TSS was the sum of the first 6 individual symptom scores (each on a scale of 0-10). Inactivity was not included in the total score. The Baseline total symptom score was the mean of daily total symptom scores from the last 7 consecutive days prior to the first study dose and ranged from 0 to 60. The Week 24 total symptom score was the mean of the daily total symptom scores from the last 28 consecutive days prior to the Week 24 visit and ranged from 0 to 60. A higher score indicates worse symptoms. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat population: All enrolled participants. Note that 3 subjects did not have the Week 24 TSS; one subject dropped out for disease progression and two withdrew consent prior to the Week 24 TSS assessment. Thus 39 subjects were analyzed.</population>

        <description>Spleen volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. The MRIs were read in the central imaging laboratory. Spleen volume was obtained by outlining the circumference of the organ and determining the volume using the technique of least squares. MRI was the preferred method for obtaining spleen volume data. CT scans were performed if the participant was not a candidate for MRI. The CT scans were processed by the same central laboratory used for MRIs. The same method (MRI or CT) was used for all visits for a given participant unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurred.</description>

        <title>Mean Percentage Change in Abdominal Symptom Scores at Week 24.</title>
        <description>Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a symptom diary, the modified MFSAF v2.0. Participants were issued a hand-held device to record answers to queries regarding 7 symptoms of myelofibrosis each night from Baseline through Week 24. The abdominal symptom score was the sum of 3 individual symptom scores (abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left side, and feeling of fullness [early satiety]), each on a scale of 0 to 10. A higher score indicates worse symptoms. A negative change score indicates improvement. The Baseline abdominal symptom score was the mean of daily abdominal symptom scores from the last 7 consecutive days prior to the first study dose and ranged from 0 to 30. The Week 24 abdominal symptom score was the mean of the daily abdominal symptom scores from the last 28 consecutive days prior to the Week 24 visit and ranged from 0 to 30.</description>
