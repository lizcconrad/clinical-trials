  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether grape consumption can reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular disease by reducing the presence of inflammatory molecules and positively
      altering cholesterol levels, lipid profiles, and immune cell responses.

      Obese individuals are at high risk for the development of hypertension and cardiovascular
      disease. Adipose tissue is a major source of pro-inflammatory molecules which can promote the
      development of atherosclerosis. Development of atherosclerotic plaques are mediated by
      oxidized or otherwise modified LDL cholesterol and infiltration of activated immune cells
      into the atherosclerotic lesions. Grapes contain high levels of polyphenols, a class of
      compounds known to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The overall goal of
      this proposal is to determine whether grape consumption can reduce the risk of cardiovascular
      disease by reducing the presence of inflammatory molecules and positively altering
      cholesterol levels, lipid profiles, and immune cell responses. Using a randomized cross-over
      design, twenty obese subjects will consume beverages containing either four servings of grape
      powder per day or the caloric equivalent without grape powder (placebo control) for a total
      of three weeks. After a two week washout period, the beverages will be switched for a further
      three weeks. Blood will be taken from each person at six intervals to determine lipid
      profiles, measure inflammatory markers in plasma, and analyze immune cell responsiveness.
