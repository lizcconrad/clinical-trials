  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a prospective, single centre, open label, observational
      trial.

      The study will collect information about the medical care patients receive during their
      planned procedure(s). No new testing or procedures will be done.

      Patients elected for hybrid revascularization will be asked their written consent to the use
      of their personal data.

      Left internal mammary artery to the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery
      (LIMA-LAD)surgical revascularization will be performed first, followed by percutaneous
      revascularization of the other vessels in the frame of the same hospitalization.

      After discharge patients will attend clinic visits at 30 days and 12 months, as per usual
      clinical practice, and will be contacted by phone at 6 months after procedure. Angiographic
      follow-up will be performed in symptomatic patients, as clinically indicated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hybrid coronary revascularization integrates the positive features of both Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), combining the durability
      of Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery (LIMA) coronary bypass with the minimal
      invasiveness and lower risk of percutaneous intervention. Thereby it might represent a better
      option in a sizeable proportion of patients.

      Candidate patients in whom hybrid revascularization would be advantageous are several
      subgroups of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients that are increasing in numbers: the
      elderly patients with a high risk of mortality and/or morbidity for CABG, patients with
      significant disabilities and patients in whom treatment durability is important but a
      significantly invasive approach is not an option.

      There are several potential advantages of the hybrid procedure over conventional CABG in
      selected patients. These advantages include the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass-related
      morbidity, no aortic manipulation with the LIMA-LAD with the beating heart procedure, less
      blood loss and decreased transfusions, a shorter recovery time than after conventional CABG
      and patient's preference for &quot;minimally invasive&quot; surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that in selected patients with diffuse coronary disease, a
      &quot;hybrid&quot; approach employing a staged revascularisation procedure may allow to lower the
      surgical risk, increase the completeness and effectiveness of revascularisation and,
      hopefully, to improve immediate and long term outcome.

      To test this hypothesis, a well designed, properly sized, prospective, randomized study is
      needed. Available data, however, do not provide sufficient information to speculate on a
      clinically meaningful, yet achievable, effectiveness.

      Aim of this observational study is therefore to collect more information on the target
      population, the clinical outcomes and optimal management in order to inform the design of a
      comparative effectiveness trial.
