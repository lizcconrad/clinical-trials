  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare two laryngeal mask airways with a
      provision for evacuation of gastric contents, the LMA Proseal and The investigators
      hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Proseal will be significantly different
      (higher) when compared with the LMA Supreme.

      The goal of this study is to compare the LMA Proseal and LMA Supreme in children having
      surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the airway leak pressures with the LMA Proseal
      will be superior to the LMA Supreme. Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the
      circuit pressure at which equilibrium is reached. The ease of placement of the device and
      gastric tube, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, feasibility of use during positive pressure
      ventilation, and complications (airway related, gastric insufflation, trauma) will also be
      assessed.
