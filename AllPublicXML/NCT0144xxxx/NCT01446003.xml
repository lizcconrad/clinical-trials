  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of treatment with multiple doses of MK-8457 on systolic
      blood pressure in participants with mild to moderate hypertension in addition to safety and
      tolerability. The study hypothesis is that MK-8457 does not increase systolic blood pressure
      to a clinically significant extent, as measured by 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic blood
      pressure change from baseline after 10 days of dosing.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 10 in 24-hour Mean Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>SBP was measured using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on Day -1 and Day 10 of each treatment period. The 24-hour least squares (LS) mean ambulatory SBP change from baseline was then determined for Day 10, the last day of multiple dose treatment. Baseline is defined as the average 24-hour SBP for each participant on Day -1. Increased values represent an increase in hypertensive severity.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued the Study Medication Due to an AE</measure>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 10 in 24-hour Mean Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>DBP was measured using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on Day -1 and Day 10 of each treatment period. The 24-hour LS mean ambulatory DBP change from baseline was then determined for Day 10, the last day of multiple dose treatment. Baseline is defined as the average 24-hour DBP for each participant on Day -1. Increased values represent an increase in hypertensive severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 10 in Maximum Moving Average (maxMAΔ) Blood Pressure Measured Over 4 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 hours postdose on Days 1 and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of drug on resting blood pressure was estimated using maxMAΔ. The maxMAΔ in blood pressure was calculated as the maximum moving average change from baseline to Day 10 of 3 consecutive 15-minute blood pressure measurements across the first 4 hours after the morning (AM) and evening (PM) doses. In this method, the LS means of three consecutive time points over the 4 hour period were determined and the maximum LS mean was used for the endpoint. Blood pressure was determined using continuous monitoring at rest. Increased values represent an increase in hypertensive severity.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 12 Hours (AUC0-12hr) of MK-8457</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-AM dose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hrs post AM dose on Days 1 and 10</time_frame>
    <description>AUC0-12hr is an estimate of total plasma exposure to study drug over the dosing interval (12hr). Plasma concentrations of MK-8457 were determined on Day 1 (after initial dosing) and Day 10 (after multiple dosing). The placebo group is not included; this endpoint evaluated only the MK-8457 group.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-8457</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-AM dose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hrs post AM dose on Days 1 and 10; 24 hrs post-AM dose on Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum plasma concentrations of MK-8521 were determined for the AM dose on Day 1 and Day 10. The placebo group was not included; this endpoint evaluated only the MK-8457 group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of MK-8457</measure>

    <description>Tmax was determined for the AM dose on Day 1 and Day 10. The placebo group was not included; this endpoint evaluated only the MK-8457 group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of MK-8457</measure>

    <description>The lowest plasma concentration reached by the drug prior to the next administration was determined for Day 1 (after initial dosing) and Day 10 (after multiple dosing). The placebo group was not included; this endpoint evaluated only the MK-8457 group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 10 in 24-hour Mean Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</title>
        <description>SBP was measured using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on Day -1 and Day 10 of each treatment period. The 24-hour least squares (LS) mean ambulatory SBP change from baseline was then determined for Day 10, the last day of multiple dose treatment. Baseline is defined as the average 24-hour SBP for each participant on Day -1. Increased values represent an increase in hypertensive severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 10 in Maximum Moving Average (maxMAΔ) Blood Pressure Measured Over 4 Hours</title>
        <description>The effect of drug on resting blood pressure was estimated using maxMAΔ. The maxMAΔ in blood pressure was calculated as the maximum moving average change from baseline to Day 10 of 3 consecutive 15-minute blood pressure measurements across the first 4 hours after the morning (AM) and evening (PM) doses. In this method, the LS means of three consecutive time points over the 4 hour period were determined and the maximum LS mean was used for the endpoint. Blood pressure was determined using continuous monitoring at rest. Increased values represent an increase in hypertensive severity.</description>

          <description>AUC0-12hr is an estimate of total plasma exposure to study drug over the dosing interval (12hr). Plasma concentrations of MK-8457 were determined on Day 1 (after initial dosing) and Day 10 (after multiple dosing). The placebo group is not included; this endpoint evaluated only the MK-8457 group.</description>
