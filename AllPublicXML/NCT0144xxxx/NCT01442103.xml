    <textblock>
      This investigation will be conducted in the US as a single-center study to evaluate in total
      10 subjects, to explore the clinical utility of a new silver gel for use on chronic wounds.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both inpatients and outpatients will be included in this study. The patients will present
      with chronic wounds in need of initial treatment prior to initiating standard of care (i.e.
      wound bed with eschar or slough), in need of treatment after debridement or with presenting
      inflammation along with need for treatment.Only one wound will be chosen for treatment in the
      study and the area should not exceed 10x10 cm and not be deeper than 6 cm. Photos of the
      wound will be taken at each visit.

             infection or inflammation (i.e. not felt to have systemic involvement) as indicated by
             the presence of at least 2 of the following clinical signs of infection:

               -  Erythema

               -  Edema

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of fever with 2 or more clinical signs of infection that in the opinion of
             the investigator is indicative of a more systemic type infection.
