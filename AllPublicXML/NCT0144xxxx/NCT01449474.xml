    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the common and effective procedure for treatment of
      end-staged knee osteoarthritis. Postoperative alignment of TKA is one of the important
      factors which effects on survival of prosthesis. High percentage of misalignment has been
      reported in conventional technique with using the jig based instruments. Several methods and
      devices were established to solve this problem. Customized or patient matched instruments
      were the novel technology that made from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lower limb. With
      using special software to calculate the alignment axis, it was thought that accurate
      alignment can be achieved by using this instruments. Therefore, the study aimed to compare
      the accuracy of MRI based patient matched instruments and jig based instruments in TKA.
