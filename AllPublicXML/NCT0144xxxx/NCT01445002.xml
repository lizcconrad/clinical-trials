    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the dose response of immunotherapy against grass pollen allergy using
      the recombinant grass pollen vaccine BM32. Efficacy will be analyzed by:

        -  skin prick testing

        -  grass pollen inhalation challenge

        -  antibody responses. In addition, the safety of subcutaneous application of BM32 will be
           evaluated.
