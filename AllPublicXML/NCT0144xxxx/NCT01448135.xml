  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerance profile of
      the enteral feeding product VITAL AF (a semi-elemental, high protein, and high omega-3 fish
      oil) when compared to Osmolite 1.2, a standard feeding product in critically ill and/or post
      surgical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). If enough patients are recruited,
      inferences about impact on outcomes may also be drawn.
