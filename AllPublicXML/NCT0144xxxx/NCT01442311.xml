  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug users account for a disproportionately large burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection. However, HCV treatment adherence rates in drug users may be suboptimal in patients
      who use drugs regularly during HCV treatment. Because HCV treatment is most effective when
      patients adhere to at least 80% of the prescribed treatment regimen, interventions to improve
      HCV treatment adherence need to be developed and evaluated. The investigators designed the
      HCV DOT trial to test the efficacy of two versions of modified directly observed HCV therapy
      provided on-site at a methadone clinic. The primary objective of this trial is to determine
      whether enhanced DOT with both pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (PEG/RBV-DOT) is
      more efficacious than standard DOT with weekly provider-administered pegylated interferon
      (PEG-DOT) and self-administered ribavirin for increasing adherence and improving HCV
      treatment outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that PEG/RBV-DOT is associated with
      increased adherence and rates of sustained viral response compared with PEG-DOT.
