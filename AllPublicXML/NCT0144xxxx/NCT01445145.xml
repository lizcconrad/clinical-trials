  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Few resources exist for helping adolescents and young adults with cancer or HIV disease
           understand their changing physical, emotional and social needs when treatment is no
           longer effective.

        -  An advance directive document called Five Wishes has had particular success with the
           adult population because of the consideration of personal, emotional and spiritual needs
           in addition to medical and legal concerns.

      Objectives:

      -To learn which questions in Five Wishes are useful for adolescents and young adults and to
      then create a new document that reflects the issues they feel are most appropriate for people
      with cancer or HIV disease.

      Eligibility:

      -Adolescents and young adults 16 to 30 years of age with advanced cancer or HIV disease
      acquired perinatally or early in life and enrolled in an active NIH treatment protocol.

      Design:

        -  Stage 1: Participants go through each question in Five Wishes and respond to whether
           they feel the questions are useful.

        -  Stage 2: Participants are asked to compare each question from Five Wishes to a newly
           developed document based on the feedback received during first stage of the study.

        -  Participants are enrolled for either Stage 1 or Stage 2 depending on the date they enter
           the study.

      Background:

        -  Discussing end of life (EoL) care with adolescents and young adults can be one of the
           most difficult aspects of living with a life threatening disease.

        -  Few established resources exist to aid this population in accepting and understanding
           their changing physical, emotional and social needs when treatment is no longer
           effective. Standards in palliative care suggest that discussion of end of life issues be
           routine and commence soon after diagnosis.

        -  While many helpful documents exist to facilitate such conversations with adults, few
           address the particular concerns and needs of adolescents and young adults.

        -  One advance directive (AD) document, Five Wishes, has had particular success with the
           adult population because of the consideration of 'personal, emotional and spiritual
           needs' in addition to medical and legal concerns.

      Objective:

        -  To determine if adolescents and young adults living with advanced cancer or HIV disease
           feel that an AD document, such as Five Wishes, is useful in addressing end of life
           issues.

        -  To develop and perform a pilot evaluation of a modified age-appropriate advance care
           planning tool for young adults and adolescents based on Five Wishes that reflects the
           participants opinions on which questions they feel are most useful and additional items
           that might be helpful.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age: 16 to 30 years

        -  Known metastatic, progressive or recurrent cancer or HIV disease acquired perinatally or
           early in life and enrolled in an active NIH treatment protocol.

      Design:

      -A descriptive study of attitudes of young adults (16-30 years) with cancer or HIV disease
      concerning the questions contained in the AD document Five Wishes as well as a comparison
      between Five Wishes and a modified version of that document.

          -  Patients at NIH or participating site must have 1) a diagnosis of metastatic,
             recurrent, or progressive cancer with a mean survival rate of 2 years or less or 2) a
             diagnosis of perinatal or early life transfusion associated HIV infection. The
             treatment protocol PI or attending physician must consent to have a patient entered
             into this protocol. Newly diagnosed patients must have completed at least three cycles
             of chemotherapy.

          -  For patients less than 18 years of age, a legal guardian must provide informed consent
             and the patients must sign an assent document.

          -  Patients greater than 18 years of age must give informed consent.

          -  Patients less than 18 years of age must have a score of 40 or higher on
             Lanksy/Karnofsky, as determined by the medical team at the time of enrollment.

          -  Patients greater than 18 years of age must have a score of 3 or less on the Eastern
             Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale (ECOG PS) at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients must be English or Spanish speaking.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Presence of psychotic symptoms or severe psychological distress, which in the judgment
             of the Principal or Associate Investigator, or consulting psychiatrist would
             compromise the patient s ability to engage in the intervention or is likely to
             interfere with the study procedures or results.

          -  Previously identified cognitive impairment which in the judgment of the Principal or
             Associate Investigator would compromise the patient s ability to understand the Five
             Wishes material or is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.

          -  Clinically significant, systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac,
             pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction) which in the judgment of the research
             team would compromise the patient s ability to tolerate this study
