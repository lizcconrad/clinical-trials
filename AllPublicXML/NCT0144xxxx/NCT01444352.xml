      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an
      investigational pneumococcal vaccine in healthy adult volunteers.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an investigational pneumococcal vaccine.

      Observational Objective:

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of an investigational Pneumococcal vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An initial cohort of 10 participants will receive a single dose of investigational
      pneumococcal vaccine. After safety assessment of this cohort during a 24-hour in-unit
      observation period, additional cohorts will receive two injections of the study vaccine 30
      days apart, at three dose levels, in ascending doses by cohort, pending safety review at each
      dose level. All participants will be monitored for safety for 30 days after each vaccination.
