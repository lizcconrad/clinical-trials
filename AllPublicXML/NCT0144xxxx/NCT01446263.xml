  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased use of radial access for cardiac catheterization is being advocated because studies
      have showed lower arterial access related complication rates and higher patient satisfaction
      as compared to femoral access. However, little is known on patients with prior coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG). The RADIAL CABG Trial is a randomized-controlled trial proposed
      to test the hypothesis that bypass graft angiography and intervention via radial access
      provides lower vascular complication rates, similar contrast and equipment utilization and
      higher patient satisfaction when compared with transfemoral approach.

      This is a phase III, single-center, prospective, randomized trial that will compare resource
      utilization, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction between radial and femoral access for
      patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)surgery undergoing coronary and graft
      angiography and intervention. During clinically-indicated coronary angiography of patients
      with prior CABG, the amount resources used, radiation exposure to patients and operators,
      occurence of complications and patients satisfaction will be compared between the two
      treatment arms to determine whether compared to femoral approach radial access will result
      in:

        1. similar contrast utilization (primary endpoint)

        2. similar procedure time (secondary endpoint)

        3. similar fluoroscopy time (secondary endpoint)

        4. similar radiation exposure of the patient - measured as DAP [dose area product] and AK
           [air kerma] (secondary endpoint)

        5. similar radiation exposure of the operators using portable radiation dose measuring
           devices (secondary endpoint)

        6. similar number and types of catheters and guidewires used (secondary endpoint)

        7. reduction in vascular access complications (secondary endpoint)

        8. reduction in overall complications (vascular access complications,injury, bleeding,
           death, emergency coronary bypass surgery, stroke, acute myocardial infarction)
           (secondary endpoint)

        9. higher patient satisfaction as measured by standardized survey 24-hours after the
           procedure (secondary endpoint)
