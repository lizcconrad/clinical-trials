  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of our new web-based version of
      the CBT4CBT program to evaluate its effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling
      at SATU. The computer-based training program (CBT4CBT) focuses on teaching basic coping
      skills, presenting examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of realistic
      situations in video form, and providing opportunities for patients to practice and review new
      skills while receiving substance abuse treatment.

    <textblock>
      One hundred eighty drug-using individuals seeking treatment at the Substance Abuse Treatment
      Unit (SATU) of the Connecticut Mental Health Center will be randomized to (1) standard
      outpatient counseling at SATU (typically consisting of weekly group counseling), (2)
      individual clinician delivered CBT, or (3) web-based CBT4CBT. Treatments will be delivered
      over a 12-week period with a six-month follow-up after termination of the study treatments.
      The primary outcome measures will be reduction in substance use (frequency of drug use by
      time, confirmed by urine toxicology screens). Secondary outcomes will include treatment
      utilization and cost, several measures intended to detect whether web-based CBT4CBT retains
      key characteristics of traditional clinician-administered CBT (e.g., acquisition of coping
      skills, use of change strategies), participant characteristics which will be evaluated as
      potential moderators of outcome, as well as participant satisfaction and treatment
      credibility.
