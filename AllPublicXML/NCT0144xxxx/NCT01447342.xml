        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a male or female, 30 to 70 years old.

          2. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.

          3. Subject has a forehead wrinkle rating by the investigator/designee of at least &quot;2&quot; in
             animation on the 5-point Wrinkle Scale (5WS) which upon physical
             manipulation/separation of the skin demonstrates a reduction in wrinkle severity.
             Subject may also have a glabellar score of &quot;1&quot; or higher in animation on a 4-point
             scale.

          4. Subject is willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all
             follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          5. Subject is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition
             that might impair evaluation of forehead and/or glabellar wrinkle rating or which, in
             the investigator's opinion, exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study.

          2. Subject has used an investigational drug or investigational device treatment within 30
             days prior to first administration of the device.

          3. Subject has a clotting disorder or has used an anticoagulant (e.g., Coumadin,
             clopidogrel, etc.) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device.

          4. Subject has used aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g.,
             ibuprofen, and naproxen) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device.

          5. Subject has had prior surgery that alters the subcutaneous anatomy of the target
             treatment sites.

          6. Subject has undergone another facial cosmetic procedure at or above the level of the
             cheekbones within the past six (6) months.

          7. Subject has any of the following conditions:

               1. History of facial nerve palsy,

               2. Marked facial asymmetry,

               3. Ptosis,

               4. History of neuromuscular disorder,

               5. Chronic dry eye symptoms,

               6. Allergy or intolerance to lidocaine,

               7. Other local skin condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site,

               8. Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's opinion would
                  prevent adequate study participation.

               9. Chronic medical condition that in the investigator's opinion would affect study
                  participation (such as diabetes, hepatitis, HIV, etc.).

              10. Any chronic condition contraindicated for the use of nerve mapping device
                  including heart disease, use of a cardiac pacemaker, and pregnancy.

          8. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in
             the opinion of the investigator.
