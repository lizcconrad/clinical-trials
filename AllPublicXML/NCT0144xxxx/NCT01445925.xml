    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that modification of the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) substrate by
      radiofrequency ablation would improve single procedure success rates for Radio Frequency
      Ablation (RFA) for Non-paroxysmal AF when compared to that achieved with short-term
      peri-procedural anti-arrhythmic drug therapy alone.

    <intervention_name>Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)</intervention_name>
    <description>Using a 4mm irrigated tip radiofrequency ablation catheter a series of lesions &gt;2 mm outside pulmonary vein (PV) ostia will be made to encircle and electrically isolate the pulmonary veins in two ipsilateral pairs (wide area circumferential ablation, WACA). A 20-pole PV mapping catheter will be used to confirm electrical isolation. If the patient is in atrial fibrillation at this stage, sinus rhythm would be restored with electrical cardioversion and PVI would be confirmed in sinus rhythm</description>

    <description>Using a 4mm irrigated tip radiofrequency ablation catheter a series of lesions &gt;2 mm outside PV ostia will be made to encircle and electrically isolate the pulmonary veins in two ipsilateral pairs (wide area circumferential ablation, WACA)34. A 20-pole PV mapping catheter will be used to confirm electrical isolation. Once PVI has been achieved, patients will go onto to receive additional linear ablation lesions. These will include a left atrial roof line, mitral isthmus line, (including ablation inside the coronary sinus if necessary), and ablation on the cavotricuspid isthmus. If the patient is in atrial fibrillation at this stage, the acute end-point would be signal obliteration at the ablated area. Once sinus rhythm is restored with electrical cardioversion, PVI would be confirmed in sinus rhythm and conduction block across the LA roof line, Mitral line and CTI will then be verified with appropriate pacing manoeuvres.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing symptoms (European Heart Rhythm Association Class 2 or above) in spite of
             treatment with rate control medication

          -  Non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, as pre-classified as

               -  Persistent AF: AF requiring Electrical/ Chemical cardioversion or that lasting &gt;7
                  days. These patients may be in AF or in sinus Rhythm at the time of their initial
                  assessment and/ or at the time of their ablation.

               -  Continuous Persistent AF: These patients are persistently in AF with or without
                  antiarrhythmic drug therapy, as confirmed on a 24 hour Holter. They may have
                  undergone previous cardioversion(s).

               -  Sustained Paroxysmal AF with underlying substrate: Patients with Individual AF
                  episode(s) lasting &gt;12 hours but less than 7 days plus one or more of the
                  following:

                    -  Age &gt;65 years 21

                    -  Individual AF episode(s) lasting &gt;24 hours

                    -  Significant left atrial dilatation of &gt;45 mm on Echo (Parasternal Long Axis
                       view)

                    -  Obesity (Body Mass Index &gt;30), and/ or history suggestive of sleep apnoea

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness to receive oral anticoagulation with warfarin

          -  Previous Ablation procedure for AF

          -  Unwillingness or inability to complete the required follow up arrangements

          -  Presence of long standing persistent AF with continuous AF longer than 12 months. This
             includes patients in whom sinus rhythm may have been maintained following electrical
             cardioversion for a period of less than 1 week at a stretch.

          -  Documented typical atrial flutter

          -  Prior prosthetic mitral valve replacement or severe structural cardiac abnormality

          -  Contraindications and/ or prior intolerance to both Amiodarone and Flecainide.

          -  Reversible cause for atrial fibrillation

          -  Known hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy
