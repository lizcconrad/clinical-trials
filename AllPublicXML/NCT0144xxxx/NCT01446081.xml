    <textblock>
      Reduced quality of life, fatigue, and loss of physical function are common in patients
      getting chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The investigators completed a pilot
      study showing that exercise during active chemotherapy for AML is feasible, safe, and may
      improve symptoms and physical function. The investigators now propose to compare our
      hospital-based supervised exercise program to usual care to see if exercise can improve
      symptoms, physical function, and improve treatment tolerability.

    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a life-threatening malignant blood disorder. Curative
      treatment requires multiple cycles of intensive chemotherapy. The first cycle, induction, is
      the most intense and intended to achieve complete disease remission (CR). Induction therapy
      requires 4-6 weeks of inpatient admission and is associated with extended bed rest and
      multiple toxicities, leading to physical deconditioning. Regular exercise during induction
      may reduce declines in physical fitness, leading to improved quality of life (QOL), reduced
      fatigue, improved tolerance of chemotherapy, and potentially greater survival. Four prior
      studies of exercise in AML patients undergoing induction have suggested improvements in QOL,
      fatigue, physical function, and treatment tolerability. However, all 4 studies suffered from
      major limitations including small sample sizes, design limitations, generalizability
      concerns, and limited safety information. The investigators conducted a pilot non-randomized
      study in 35 AML patients and demonstrated feasibility, safety, and potential improvements in
      QOL, fatigue, and physical fitness outcomes. The investigators now propose a rigorous
      evaluation of the intervention in a phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Primary objectives include: (1) To determine the efficacy of a supervised mixed-modality
      exercise program during induction chemotherapy on QOL and fatigue; (2) To determine the
      efficacy on physical fitness. Our secondary objective is to determine the efficacy on AML
      treatment tolerability (hospital length of stay, development of sepsis, intensive care unit
      (ICU) admission, delays in consolidation chemotherapy).

    <description>Patients will receive an individualized, supervised mixed-modality exercise program created by a CSEP-Certified Exercise Physiologist (CEP). They will perform 30 minutes of light to moderate intensity exercise 4-5 times/week tailored to ability. Aerobic exercise will primarily consist of walking and/or stationary cycling. Resistance exercises will target large muscle groups using dumbbells, resistance bands, and stability balls. The CEP will monitor and document details of each exercise session as well as patient tolerance and symptoms, and make appropriate adaptations to ensure program safety and progression. Exercise intensity and duration will vary based on patient tolerance, symptoms and blood parameters. Exercise equipment will be carefully sanitized between each use.</description>
