  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the echocardiographic data obtained from patients
      with calcifications in the mitral valve who are undergoing a cardiac (heart) catheterization.

      Echocardiography is a non-invasive (does not break the skin) procedure used to see an image
      of the heart. It uses harmless sound waves to create an image of the heart on a computer
      screen. These images will show the valves of the heart, how well the heart is pumping blood,
      the blood flow across these valves and how large the heart is. A silver paddle-shaped device
      is moved easily over the skin to capture these images.

      Calcification (hardening) of the heart valves and heart rings (fibrous tissue surrounding the
      valves) is a common finding and it increases with age. The presence of calcification changes
      the blood flow through the heart valves. This makes any echocardiographic data (information)
      obtained from patients with calcifications difficult to interpret.

    <textblock>
      Patients with significant mitral annular calcification (MAC) have largely been excluded from
      studies validating non invasive (echocardiographic) measurements of left ventricular filling
      and diastolic function. The investigators hypothesize that echocardiographic estimates of
      diastolic function, left atrial pressure (LAP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure
      (LVEDP) are likely to be fallacious in patients with moderate to severe mitral annular
      calcification due to the structural alterations and technical difficulties involved.
