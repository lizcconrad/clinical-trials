  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may be associated with significant blood loss, and transfusion
      carries substantial risk of immunologic reaction and disease transmission. Several methods
      reportedly reduce postoperative blood loss and avoid homologous blood transfusion with
      traditional TKA approaches. Drain clamping was one of the widely used method and tranexamic
      acid administration was the recently adjuvant method to reduce blood loss in TKA. However,
      there were several regimens in either drain clamping or tranexamic acid administration
      reported in previous studies. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of our drain clamping
      protocol and/or tranexamic acid regimen for reducing blood loss and transfusion in TKA.
