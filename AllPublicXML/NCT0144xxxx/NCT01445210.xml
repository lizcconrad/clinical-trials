  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most useful method to manage pain after major ankle surgery is infusion of local
      analgesics with a catheter close to the sciatic nerve.

      Sensation from the ankle are carried by three nerves: The tibial and peroneal nerve (unified
      in the sciatic nerve) and the saphenous nerve.

      Study purpose is to test whether continuous infusion of local analgesics by saphenous nerve
      catheter provide a better treatment of pain in comparison with a single injection nerve
      block. In addition cost-effectiveness of the two methods are compared.

      The 50 patients of the trial are randomized in clusters of ten. We intend to do a preliminary
      analysis of the data from the first 40 patients. However, it is not an interim analysis.
      Fifty patients will be included independent of the result of the preliminary analysis. The
      random allocation of the last 10 patients will also be double-blinded.

      Major ankle surgery are known to be very painful the first 48 hours after the operation due
      to surgical oedema. This pain is difficult to control with systemic analgesics. Pain relief
      with systemic analgesics requires high doses of intravenous opioids and is associated with
      breakthrough pain and adverse effects of opioids (sedation, nausea, vomiting, obstipation,
      urinary retention, respiratory depression).

      Continuous, peripheral nerve block with catheter technique for two days minimizes the need
      for systemic analgesics. Today such a continuous sciatic nerve block is part of the standard
      pain treatment after major ankle surgery on Aarhus University Hospital. Despite accurate
      placement of the catheter many patients are in great pain because the saphenous nerve remain
      unaffected. A single injection block relieve the pain but a block with Ropivacaine only last
      8-15 hours.

      Severe postoperative pain leads to high opioid dosages, cognitive blurring, nausea, vomiting,
      reduced ambulation, increased surgical stress response and increased morbidity. Pain problems
      and adverse effects prolongs postoperative observation time and maybe also time to discharge.

      The aim of the study establish whether continuous saphenous nerve block is efficient (pain
      relief or reduced opioid consumption) and justified (cost-effectiveness analysis) compared
      with single injection block.
