    <measure>Change from Baseline Glomerular Filtration Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Every hour during final 6 hours of study drug infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of glomerular filtration rate are made hourly during the 6-hour study drug infusion on study Day 1 and study Day 3. GFR in hours 4-6 are compared to GFR in hours 1-3, and comparisons made between Placebo and TRV120027.</description>
