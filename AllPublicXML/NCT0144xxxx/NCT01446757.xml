  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to study if a Comprehensive Geriatric
      Assessment (CGA) and follow up for community-dwelling elderly people can improve outcomes
      such as health and health-related quality of life among both patients and relatives, feeling
      of safety among both patients and relatives and reduce costs, compared with usual care.

    <textblock>
      Frail older adults are at increased risk of vulnerability and serious health problems. This
      leads to increased suffering and higher healthcare utilization. There are major gaps in the
      knowledge needed to create the most favourable care model for preventing frailty and
      increasing health-related of life. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to
      study if a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and follow up in community-dwelling elderly
      people can prevent frailty, hospitalisation and adverse effects of frailty, improve health
      and health-related quality of life, and reduce costs, compared with usual care. In a
      randomized, controlled trial with 24 months of follow-up, a total of 430 older adults with
      multimorbidity will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will receive
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and follow up and the same standard health care services
      as the control group. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and follow up will be provides
      through an outpatient facility that tailors care from a holistic perspective and, based on
      each patient's individual needs in line with the policy program that Sweden's pensioners'
      organizations have presented in 2010 together with the Swedish Association of Geriatric
      Medicine. The team includes, among other things. a. geriatricians, nurses, physiotherapists,
      assistance officer, dietician, pharmacist and co-operation with the dental hygienist.

      The primary outcome is development of frailty and hospitalization. Secondary outcomes are
      adverse effects of frailty, health and health-related quality of life and costs. There is a
      knowledge gap of how health care can identify persons with frailty and risks for frailty and
      how to meet their specific care needs. The study aims to fill a clinically important
      knowledge gap that can guide further development of future care for older people with
      multi-morbidity and frailty. CGA is readily transferable to clinical practice.

Low physical activity includes assessment of habitual physical activity level by using the Swedish version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version (IPAQ-S).Slow walking speed is determined from the better of two attempts at usual &quot;comfortable&quot; walking speed over 4 m with or without a walking aid. Weakness (muscle strength) is assessed by maximal grip strength.</description>

    <description>Medical assessment (co-morbid condition, physical and neurological examination, medication review, nutrition, and blood-tests to identify anaemia, diabetes, metabolism and liver- and kidney function); assessment of functioning (ADL/IADL, fall risk), psychological assessment (cognitive decline and depression) and assessment of social and environmental conditions. The care plan is based on the CGA and will be individualised and carried out in discussion with the patient and his/her caregivers. The care will be carried out by an inter-professional Geriatric Team with employees from both the county council and the municipality. The team consists of a core team (including geriatrician and nurse) and a support team (including a social worker, occupational therapist, dietician, pharmacist, physiotherapist, and dental hygienist). The care will involve treatment for unstable medical conditions and support of patients and their caregivers. The team will have regular team conferences.</description>
