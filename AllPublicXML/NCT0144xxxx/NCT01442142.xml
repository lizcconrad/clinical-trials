    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to pilot test, evaluate and compare the effects of Cue
      Reactivity and Sensitivity Training (CRST) and Children's Appetite Awareness Training (CAAT)
      in 48 children aged 8-12 years old. The central hypothesis is that CRST and CAAT will reduce
      eating in the absence of hunger in overweight children immediately following treatment and
      6-months post treatment.

      The primary aim of this proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and compare the
      effectiveness of Cue Responsivity and Sensitivity Training (CRST) or Children's Appetite
      Awareness Training (CAAT) in decreasing eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) in overweight
      children. Following this first intervention, a second intervention to determine the efficacy
      of a combination program (combined CAAT &amp; CRST) will be implemented.

      The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate change in the following related measures for
      both children and adults who participated in CRST, CAAT, and the combination program: BMI for
      age, food intake, perceptions of control over eating, and self-efficacy in managing high-risk
      food situations.

    <description>In this 14 week intervention combining Children's Appetite Awareness Training (CAAT) and Cue Reactivity and Sensitivity Training (CRST), parents and kids learn about both internal hunger cues and external cues that can cause one to overeat. Skills to learn the internal hunger cues and better responses to external cues are taught.</description>

    <description>Between baseline and the post-intervention data collection point, no intervention is given. Participants are given a take home binder of intervention materials at that second data collection point; they have the option of reviewing the material prior to the final follow-up data collection point.</description>

    <intervention_name>CAAT: Appetite Awareness</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants in this Children's Appetite Awareness Training (CAAT) group learn to get in touch with the internal cues of hunger - aka the &quot;hunger meter&quot; - and practice skills to get back in touch with these internal cues of true hunger and fullness. Sessions occur once a week for 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants in this Cue Reactivity and Sensitivity Training (CRST) group learn about how external cues can affect when and how much we eat (aka &quot;volcravo - the craving volcano&quot;). Over 8 weekly sessions, they practice skills to ride out the cravings external cues can cause.</description>

    <description>Participants meet weekly for 14 weeks to learn about both Children's Appetite Awareness Training (CAAT) and Cue Reactivity and Sensitivity Training (CRST) - i.e. appetite awareness and external cues that affect food intake.</description>
