    <textblock>
      This study was a Phase 1 and pharmacologic dose-escalation trial of MM-121 in combination
      with certain anticancer therapies. The dose-escalation portion of the study employed a 3 + 3
      design to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MM-121 administered weekly
      in combination with certain anticancer therapies in patients with advanced/recurrent cancer.
      Doses of MM-121 and/or the anticancer therapy were escalated until either the MTD is
      identified or the combination was shown to be tolerable at the highest planned doses.

    <time_frame>From date of first dose to 30 days after termination, the longest 88.1 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using a 3+3 dose escalation model, the maximum tolerated dose of each therapy combination was determined by assessing dose-limiting toxicities in each cohort. If 3 patients were treated and passed the observation window, escalation to the next cohort was initiated. If a DLT was reported, 3-4 additional patients were enrolled and observed. If a DLT was observed in expanded cohort, this dose was considered to be the maximum tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose was defined at the cohort in which two dose-limiting toxicities were observed, or as the highest target dose tested in the absence of DLTs. The determined MTD was considered the Recommended Phase 2 Dose.
Dose Levels (3 week cycles) MM-121 doses tested: 20 mg/kg IV one-time loading dose then 12 mg/kg IV QW (20/12 mg/kg); 40/20 mg/kg Gemcitabine doses tested: 1000 mg/m2 Day 1 and 8 Pemetrexed doses tested: 500 mg/m2 Day 1 Carboplatin doses tested: 5 or 6 AUC Day 1 Cabazitaxel doses tested: 20 or 25 mg/m2 Day 1 of 3</description>

        <title>To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MM-121 in Combination With Anticancer Therapies: MM-121 Doses</title>
        <description>Using a 3+3 dose escalation model, the maximum tolerated dose of each therapy combination was determined by assessing dose-limiting toxicities in each cohort. If 3 patients were treated and passed the observation window, escalation to the next cohort was initiated. If a DLT was reported, 3-4 additional patients were enrolled and observed. If a DLT was observed in expanded cohort, this dose was considered to be the maximum tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose was defined at the cohort in which two dose-limiting toxicities were observed, or as the highest target dose tested in the absence of DLTs. The determined MTD was considered the Recommended Phase 2 Dose.
Dose Levels (3 week cycles) MM-121 doses tested: 20 mg/kg IV one-time loading dose then 12 mg/kg IV QW (20/12 mg/kg); 40/20 mg/kg Gemcitabine doses tested: 1000 mg/m2 Day 1 and 8 Pemetrexed doses tested: 500 mg/m2 Day 1 Carboplatin doses tested: 5 or 6 AUC Day 1 Cabazitaxel doses tested: 20 or 25 mg/m2 Day 1 of 3</description>

        <title>To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MM-121 in Combination With Anticancer Therapies: Pemetrexed</title>
        <description>Using a 3+3 dose escalation model, the maximum tolerated dose of each therapy combination was determined by assessing dose-limiting toxicities in each cohort. If 3 patients were treated and passed the observation window, escalation to the next cohort was initiated. If a DLT was reported, 3-4 additional patients were enrolled and observed. If a DLT was observed in expanded cohort, this dose was considered to be the maximum tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose was defined at the cohort in which two dose-limiting toxicities were observed, or as the highest target dose tested in the absence of DLTs. The determined MTD was considered the Recommended Phase 2 Dose.
Dose Levels (3 week cycles) MM-121 doses tested: 20 mg/kg IV one-time loading dose then 12 mg/kg IV QW (20/12 mg/kg); 40/20 mg/kg Pemetrexed doses tested: 500 mg/m2 Day 1</description>

        <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was performed on plasma samples obtained weekly for the first cycle of the study and then on day 1 of each additional cycle to assess pre-treatment trough concentrations of MM-121. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed to calculate standard PK parameters, including the maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Serum levels of MM-121 were measured at a central lab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data is presented per dose level of MM-121 (12 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 40/20 mg/kg).</description>
