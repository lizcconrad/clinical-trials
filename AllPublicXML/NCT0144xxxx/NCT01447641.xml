    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess both the sleep and circadian (24-hourly biological
      rhythms) physiology of people with cluster headache. For sufferers with the episodic form of
      the disorder this will involve observation at two separate time points, once when
      experiencing attacks (in-bout) and once when attack free (out-of-bout).

      The study will include measurement of basic rest-activity patterns, sleep timing and timing
      of individual attacks, as well as a more detailed study recording sleep and circadian rhythms
      under clinical conditions over consecutive nights.

      Studying the differences in these processes in single individuals when they are both
      experiencing and free from attacks might provide insight into the brain mechanisms involved
      in triggering the bouts of attacks and individual attacks themselves. An improved
      understanding of this area may help design improved treatment options in future.
