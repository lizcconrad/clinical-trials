      This study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of three
      doses of an investigational pneumococcal vaccine in healthy adult volunteers.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an investigational Pneumococcal vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each volunteer participant will receive two injections with one of three vaccine doses,
      administered on Day 0 and Day 30, in a dose-ascending manner, pending safety review at each
      dose level. All participants will be monitored for safety for 30 days after each injection.
