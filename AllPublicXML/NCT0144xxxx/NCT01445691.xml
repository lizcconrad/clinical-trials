  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and utility of 5-aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA) for identifying your tumor during surgery. 5-ALA is not FDA approved at this time. When
      the investigators remove the tumor from your brain, it is important that they remove all of
      the tumor and not remove parts of normal brain. Sometimes this can be difficult because the
      tumor can look like normal brain. In some brain tumors, 5-ALA can make the tumors glow red
      under blue light. This may make it easier for your doctor to take out all of the tumor from
      your brain. The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Make sure that 5-ALA helps the doctor remove more of the tumor.

        -  Make sure 5-ALA does not cause any side effects.

      If you do not want to participate in this study, your doctor(s) will still do their best to
      remove all of the tumor in your brain. Whether or not you join this study will not change
      your treatment for your brain tumor.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a clinically documented primary brain tumor for which resection is
             clinically indicated. Individuals with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent
             malignant gliomas will be considered eligible for the study. The anticipated histology
             at resection should include: Anaplastic astrocytoma (10002224), Anaplastic ependymoma,
             Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, Astrocytoma malignant NOS (10003572), Glioblastoma
             (10018336), Glioblastoma multiforme (10018337), or Gliosarcoma (10018340).

          -  Prior therapy is not a consideration in protocol entry.

          -  Age 18-80.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%).

          -  Life expectancy is not a consideration for protocol entry.

          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mL

               -  Total bilirubin below upper limit of normal

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤
                  2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine below upper limit of normal OR

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal

          -  The effects of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. A pregnancy test will be performed for all women of
             childbearing ability prior to surgery. Women who are pregnant will be excluded from
             the trial.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumors of or involving the midline, basal ganglia, or brain stem as assessed by MRI.

          -  Subjects may not be receiving any experimental therapies.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Patients should refrain from use of other
             potential phototoxic substances (e.g. tetracyclines, sulfonamides,fluoroquinolones,
             hypericin extracts) for 72 hours.

          -  Personal or family history of porphyrias.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because aminolevulinic
             acid (ALA) is of unknown teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with aminolevulinic acid (ALA), breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with aminolevulinic acid (ALA).

          -  Women who are pregnant will be excluded from the trial.

          -  Prior history of GI perforation, diverticulitis, and/or peptic ulcer disease.

          -  Inclusion of women and minorities: both men and women and members of all ethnic groups
             are eligible for this trial.
