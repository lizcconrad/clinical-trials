  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study. Part 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability in healthy
      subjects of increasing daily doses of LY2484595 for 14 days to achieve a blood level of
      LY2484595 much higher than what is needed for therapy. The amount of study drug that reaches
      the bloodstream and the time it takes for the body to get rid of it will be determined. The
      effect of the study drug on factors in the blood related to cholesterol will be measured.

      Part 2 is to determine how ketoconazole affects how much of the study drug, LY2484595, gets
      into the bloodstream and how long it takes to get rid of it.

      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

      This study is a 2-part, multiple ascending dose (MAD) and drug drug interaction (DDI) study
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability and the effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition
      by ketoconazole on the PK of LY2484595 in healthy subjects.

      In the MAD portion (Part 1) of this study subjects in 4 cohorts will be randomized to receive
      either LY2484595 (doses ascending from 100 up to 1800 mg) or placebo. The total duration of
      Part 1 is approximately 13 weeks including screening.

      Subjects in Cohort A will participate in 2 periods of 14 days of consecutive dosing, followed
      by a follow-up visit ≥14-days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects in Cohorts B, C,
      and D will receive 14 days of consecutive dosing followed by a follow-up visit ≥14 days after
      last dose of study drug. Cohorts will have staggered starts ≥7 days from the previous cohort
      to allow for review of safety and tolerability.

      The DDI portion of this study (Part 2) will be open label and consist of two periods. The
      total duration of Part 2 is approximately 10 weeks. LY2484595 (100 mg) will be administered
      on Day 1 Period 1 and on Day 5 Period 2. In Period 2, Ketoconazole (400 mg) will be
      administered QD for a total of 14 days (13 days alone + 1 day with LY2484595). There is at
      least a 14 day washout period between Period 1 and Period 2, and a follow-up of greater than
      or equal to 14 days after last dose of study drug.
