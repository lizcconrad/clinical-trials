  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine contains humanized recombinant antigen (Epithelial Growth Factor) and an
      adjuvant. The antibodies induced by vaccination will react with circulating EGF leading to
      removal of EGF from the circulation. As a result, binding to its target EGF-Receptor is
      prevented. Blocking of EGF-Receptor is preventing activation and stimulation of proliferation
      of tumour cell. A Phase III clinical trial on the EGF vaccine is ongoing in Cuba. The result
      from previous studies demonstrated positive correlation between extended survival and immune
      response against the vaccination in the late-stage NSCLC patients' age below 60 with improved
      quality of life. The purpose of this international Phase III trial is to determine whether
      the recombinant human EGF cancer vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective in the treatment
      of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients compared to standard treatment and supportive care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are aged 20-65 years (inclusive).

          2. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          3. Have adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function, as assessed by the Investigator.
             A sample taken at Screening should confirm that:

               -  White blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 3000 per µL

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 per µL

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) (or ≤ 5 x ULN when liver metastases are present)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          4. Have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, corresponding
             to locally and regionally advanced, inoperable disease (Stage IIIb or Stage IV [as
             defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system]), excluding brain
             metastases.

          5. Are eligible to receive first-line chemotherapy (without concurrent thoracic
             radiotherapy or consolidation radiotherapy).

          6. Agree to use double-barrier contraception (males and females alike [if applicable]). A
             negative pregnancy test must be documented at Screening for females of childbearing
             potential.

             Note: Females of childbearing potential are defined as those women with less than 2
             years after last menstruation and not surgically sterile, while post-menopausal refers
             to those women with at least 2 years from last menstruation.

          7. Have signed a voluntary written informed consent form (ICF). Patients should be
             cooperative, willing and able to participate and adhere to the Protocol requirements,
