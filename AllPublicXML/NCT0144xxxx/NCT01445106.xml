  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is an important target in cancer because it promotes
           chemotherapeutic resistance and confers a poor prognosis for many types of cancers.

        -  Several inhibitors of the pathway are being developed as cancer therapeutics. However,
           the process of de novo drug development takes years, and is often curtailed due to
           diminished activity and/or unforeseen toxicities in clinical trials.

        -  One approach to expedite the development of new cancer therapies is to test drugs that
           are already approved for other indications.

        -  Our group has shown that nelfinavir, an orally available FDA-approved HIV-1 protease
           inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, can inhibit endogenous Akt and growth factor receptor
           induced Akt activity in cancer cells.

        -  Importantly, nelfinavir demonstrates dose-dependent cytotoxicity in every cell line in
           the NCI 60 cell line panel at plasma concentrations attainable in human plasma, is
           profoundly effective in cancer cell lines that have been selected to become resistant to
           standard therapies, and inhibits tumor growth in-vivo.

      Objectives:

        -  Because an MTD with nelfinavir has not been observed in prior phase I studies with HIV
           patients, the objectives of the Phase I design will be:

        -  To establish the MTD and dose limiting toxicity for this drug in patients with solid
           Tumors.

        -  To correlate nelfinavir pharmacokinetics with baseline activity of CYP3A4 as assessed by
           measuring midazolam clearance.

        -  To preliminarily explore the biological and clinical effects through a series of
           correlative studies involving analysis of blood and tissue across patients throughout
           the study.

      Eligibility:

      -Adults with solid tumors who are refractory to, or have relapsed after receiving, standard
      front-line chemotherapies are eligible.

      Design:

        -  Patients will receive nelfinavir beginning at the FDA-approved dose for HIV patients
           (1250 mg po bid).

        -  Dose escalations will occur for 6 dose levels i.e. cohorts, or until the MTD is reached.

        -  Up to 45 patients are expected to be enrolled.

        -  Staging CT scans will be performed every two cycles.

        for the duration of the study due to possible drug interactions.

        Patients will be asked if they would consent to a biopsy before and after treatment in
        order to provide biologic correlates for analysis, but these will be optional, and the
        patients will be eligible whether they consent to do this or not.

        Patients with brain metastasis must have undergone evaluation and appropriate counseling
        and treatment by radiation oncology.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant or lactating women.

        Patients who have had chemotherapy or biologic agents in the last 28 days prior to entering
        the study.

        active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.

        medication regimen includes 2 or more medications of a class carries the potential for
        serious side effects, and which must be changed becaused of potential interaction with
        nelfinavir, they must be stable on the new regimen for 7 days before enrollment.
