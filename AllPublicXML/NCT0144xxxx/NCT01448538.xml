    <textblock>
      In the research study an observation of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration
      (wet AMD) will be performed.

      The term observational study indicates that the current course of therapy and the associated
      circumstances will be recorded. In this study, no medical care is changed. Also, no new drugs
      are tested.

      This study is being conducted in about 30 centers in Germany. A total of approximately 500
      patients will be enrolled. The study is designed for a period of 12 months.

      At the beginning and end of the study the physician will document the patient data. Therefore
      will be used information from the patient records and documented visits. If such information
      is not available in the study center, the otherwise attending ophthalmologist will be
      consulted about the vision acuity values and visits in the observation period.

      Furthermore, patients are asked to participate in three telephone interviews and fill out
      during their visits to the study center a short questionnaire about their current vision and
      their well-being. In the telephone interviews will be discussed with the patient about his
      wet AMD disease and its treatment, its experience and its perspectives as well as any
      problems occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD)

          -  Patient has already received at least one Anti-VEGF injection

          -  From a clinical standpoint, if there is an ophthalmological need for treatment it is
             probable that the patient gets additional anti-VEGF injections in the next year.

          -  The patient is able and willing to take part in the study (answering a short
             questionnaire in the study centre, 4 independent phone interviews during study
             period).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  At time of inclusion visit, the study centre is only exceptionally responsible for the
             treatment of the patient.

          -  The patient is taking part in another study.
