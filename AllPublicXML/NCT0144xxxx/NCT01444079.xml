  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver is an organ that is well-known for its immune tolerant capacity. However, there were
      still controversial issues about the impact of immunologic challenge after liver
      transplantation on the graft function. Different results of graft function affected by
      immunologic factors such as pre-transplant panel reactive antibody (PRA) status,
      pre-transplant positive lymphocyte cross match (LCM), or post-transplant circulating donor
      specific antibody (DSA) has been reported according to individual institutes. There was no
      trial for presenting anti-donor lymphocyte antibody change after liver transplantation.

      The investigators designed this study to analyze the correlation between pre- and
      post-transplant immune status (PRA, LCM), and graft survival / rejection episode. Also, the
      investigators will find aspects of anti-donor lymphocyte antibody change after liver
      transplantation.

      Study Design: Target study population is forty patients who will undergo liver
      transplantation for 1 year in YUHS. Pediatric and early mortality cases will be excluded.
      Blood sample will be collected at pre-transplant period, post-transplant 7, 14, 21 day, 3
      month and 6 month.
