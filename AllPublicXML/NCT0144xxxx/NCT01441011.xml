  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who are obese at breast cancer diagnosis have a 1.5 to 2.5 increased risk of recurrence
      and death compared to their normal weight counterparts. Moreover, weight gain and decreased
      physical activity are common after diagnosis and also increase the likelihood of breast
      cancer recurrence and death. Rural women suffer from health disparities in breast cancer
      diagnosis and treatment. Women of the most rural counties also have the highest prevalence of
      obesity compared to urban women. To address these disparities, the overarching objective of
      this proposal is to develop a clinically effective and cost efficient strategy for delivering
      a weight control intervention to rural breast cancer survivors. Group phone-based treatment
      via conference call is a novel treatment delivery approach that the investigators have shown
      to be effective for initial weight loss among rural breast cancer survivors and more
      effective than the standard individual phone-based approach among rural women. This
      innovative method of providing group treatment addresses access barriers in rural areas and
      may be especially ideal for rural breast cancer survivors because it provides social support
      in conjunction with a level of anonymity. However, the impact of group phone counseling
      during extended care for weight loss maintenance beyond 6 months remains unknown. Weight loss
      maintenance is the more challenging phase of treatment when weight regain is common, and this
      regain presents a potential risk for breast cancer recurrence. This randomized controlled
      trial will evaluate the effects of group phone-based treatment for weight loss maintenance
      among rural breast cancer survivors, compared to an established mail-based education
      comparison condition, subsequent to a 6 month group phone-based weight loss phase for both
      conditions. In addition to the intervention impact on weight loss maintenance, the study will
      provide estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness per kg loss between the two conditions
      and the impact on secondary outcomes including quality of life, breast cancer risk
      biomarkers, dietary intake, and physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 - Weight Loss (0-6 months)

        -  Weekly group phone counseling sessions for all participants (12-14 women per group) via
           conference call for 26 consecutive weeks

        -  Low-calorie, low-fat diet recommended, including 2 pre-packaged entrees, five one-cup
           servings of fruits and vegetables and meal replacement shakes (provided free of charge)

        -  Physical activity program program recommended, beginning with 15 minutes per day, 3 days
           a week, working toward a goal of 225 minutes a week

        -  Experienced group counselor facilitates all sessions

      Phase 2 - Weight Loss Maintenance (6-18 months)

        -  Participants randomized to either group phone counseling or mail-based comparison with
           no phone counseling

        -  Weight loss maintenance group condition includes 26 bi-weekly phone sessions, while
           mail-based comparison includes 26 bi-weekly newsletters in the mail

        -  Focus is on problem-solving

      Phase 3 - Transition to Self-Reliance (18-24 months)

        -  Lasts from 18-24 months

        -  No sessions or newsletter mailings

        -  Participants are encouraged to continue to self-monitor throughout this period
