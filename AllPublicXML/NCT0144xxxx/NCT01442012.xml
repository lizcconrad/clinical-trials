      Prospective, randomized, comparative study.

      The disease to be studied is Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV). PONV, described by
      some as &quot;The Big Little Problem&quot;, has a great impact on patient´s satisfaction and the
      postoperative care needed. Considering the increase of outpatient surgery there is an
      expanding demand for effective PONV treatment to prevent delays in discharge or unplanned
      readmissions. The estimated annual costs of PONV in the U.S. per year are 100 million
      Dollars.

      Approximately 75 million patients are anesthetized in the world annually. It is estimated
      that 20-30% of these patients experience PONV, reaching 80% in patients at high risk. This
      incidence of PONV has maintained despite the improvement in surgical and anesthetic
      techniques and advances in antiemetic pharmacology. Increasingly, acupuncture is becoming
      part of Western medicine as a complementary treatment. Acupuncture has been described to
      effectively reduce the symptoms of different diseases, including PONV.

    <description>The percentage of patients with a score &lt;50 on the PONV Intensity Scale (defined as clinically not significant PONV) at 72 hours postoperatively will be assessed in the experimental and control group, respectively. In the experimental group, patients receive cutaneous stimulation and self-stimulation of acupuncture points Pericardium 6, Heart 7 and Stomach 25. In the control (placebo) group, patients receive cutaneous stimulation and self-stimulation of acupuncture points Gall Bladder 34, Kidney 6 and Liver 3.</description>

    <description>The investigators will use ear seeds to stimulate acupuncture points. The seeds will be applied when the patients are in the preoperative room. After the patients have been discharged, they will need to stimulate these points every eight hours for five minutes, and every time they have nausea and/or vomiting during the first three postoperative days.</description>
