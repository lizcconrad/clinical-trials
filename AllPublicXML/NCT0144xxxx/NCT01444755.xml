  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate survival benefit of a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen
      in patient with resectable locally advanced gastric cancer in comparison with surgery alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinoma of the stomach ranks as the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and as the
      second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Radical resection with free-margin
      gastrectomy and extended lymphadenectomy is the preferred surgical strategy in Japan and
      Asian centers.

      Unfortunately, only one-half of surgically treated patients with gastric cancer will achieve
      a complete resection without residual disease (R0) resection. Moreover, due to, the absence
      of routine screening programs for gastric cancer, the majority of the patients will be
      symptomatic at the time of diagnosis in our country.

      Additionally, recent treatment strategies were focused for downsizing or decreasing to
      loco-regional recurrence.

      In this reason, we hypothesize that preoperative chemotherapy may improve the R0 resection
      rate or disease free and/or overall survival rate.
