  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the success of anti-angiogenic therapy in multiple treatment settings, a fraction of
      patients are refractory to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor treatment
      while the majority of patients will eventually develop evasive resistance and exhibit disease
      progression while on therapy. It is proposed that mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
      (c-MET) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF or scatter factor) contribute
      significantly to VEGF inhibitor resistance such that combining a c-MET inhibitor with a VEGF
      inhibitor will provide additional clinical activity compared to VEGF inhibitor alone. This
      hypothesis will be tested using the cMET/ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, in combination with
      individual VEGF inhibitors. Three combinations will be prioritized, namely crizotinib plus
      axitinib, crizotinib plus sunitinib and crizotinib plus bevacizumab, with a fourth
      combination, crizotinib plus sorafenib to be tested only if crizotinib does not combine with
      either axitinib and/or sunitinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dose Escalation Population: Histological or cytological diagnosis of
             advanced/metastatic solid tumor that is resistant to standard therapy or for which no
             standard therapy is available. Lesions may be measurable or non measurable.

          -  Expansion Population 1: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic renal cell
             cancer with no prior systemic therapy directed at the malignant tumor.

          -  Expansion Population 2: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic renal cell
             cancer whose prior systemic therapy directed at the malignant tumor was single agent
             VEGF inhibitor and who now have acquired resistance to this treatment. Resistance is
             defined as progression following an initial response (complete or partial), or stable
             disease for at least 6 months on single agent VEGF inhibitor.

          -  Expansion Population 3: Patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma whose
             disease has failed on previous therapy, and which must have included treatment with
             external beam radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy, and who now have
             radiographically recurrent or progressive disease.

          -  Expansion Population 4: Patients with histologically confirmed advanced-stage
             (unresectable or metastatic) hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received previous
             systemic therapy directed at the malignant tumor will be eligible to receive
             crizotinib plus sorafenib, should this combination be tested. Eligibility criteria
             also include normal hepatic function or Child-Pugh hepatic function class A.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hemorrhagic brain metastases or with known symptomatic brain metastases
             requiring steroids.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting study treatment.

          -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks of starting study treatment.

          -  Hypertension that cannot be controlled with medications (&gt;150/90 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy).

          -  For glioblastoma patients: Prior treatment of glioblastoma with Gliadel wafers,
             stereotactic radiation, or brachytherapy unless there is pathological or definitive
             radiological evidence (PET scan or perfusion MRI) of recurrent tumor or unless there
             is new enhancement outside of the radiation field. History of Grade 2 or greater acute
             intracranial hemorrhage. Radiation therapy (RT) for glioblastoma within 3 months
             unless there is either: a) histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor, or b) new
             enhancement on MRI outside of the RT treatment field.Concomitant treatment with
             therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (low dose warfarin (Coumadin) up to 2 mg PO daily
             for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed).
