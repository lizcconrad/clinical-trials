    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies pazopanib hydrochloride followed by chemotherapy
      and surgery in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes that are needed for cell growth and
      may also stop the growth of soft tissue sarcoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      pazopanib hydrochloride and chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the absolute values and changes in standardized uptake values (SUV) by
      fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) before and after a 14 day Run-in
      period of pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) versus placebo, and to compare this to the
      change in SUV following pre-operative chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the correlation between antiangiogenic activity and pazopanib drug exposure.

      III. To assess the response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria after the 14 day Run-in period of pazopanib versus placebo and compare this to the
      response rate following pre-operative chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the activity of antiangiogenic therapy with pazopanib combined with
      pre-operative chemotherapy for high risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas as measured by:
      histological necrosis at surgery; change in plasma and tumor biomarker assays of angiogenesis

      II. To evaluate the safety of sequential treatment with pazopanib and pre-operative
      chemotherapy with doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) and ifosfamide.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment
      continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD. Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients then receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) continuously over days 1-3 and ifosfamide IV on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Beginning 2-4 weeks later, all patients undergo surgery
      followed by 2 more courses of chemotherapy 2-4 weeks after completion of surgery. Some
      patients may also undergo adjuvant external beam radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 days
      followed by a boost. Patients treated on Arm I may resume pazopanib hydrochloride 1 week
      after completion of all adjuvant therapy for up to 1 year. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac ventricular arrhythmia
             requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy, serious hepatic impairment, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Subjects with no additional active malignancy within the last 3 years

          -  Subjects receiving other investigational agents

             chemical or biologic composition to pazopanib or other agents used in the study

          -  Subjects who have both bilirubin &gt; ULN and AST/ALT &gt; ULN

          -  Subjects with a urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 1

          -  Subjects with a baseline corrected QT (QTc) of equal to or greater than 480 msecs or
             other significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities

          -  Certain medications that act through the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system are
             specifically prohibited in subjects receiving pazopanib and others should be avoided
             or administered with extreme caution and require principal investigator (PI) approval

               -  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
                  atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir,
                  telithromycin, voriconazole may increase pazopanib concentrations and are
                  prohibited; grapefruit juice is also an inhibitor of CYP450 and should not be
                  taken with pazopanib

               -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease pazopanib

                  but does in vitro; therefore, therapeutic doses of warfarin, a substrate of
                  CYP2C9, and omeprazole, a substrate of CYP2C19 are permitted; caffeine, a
                  substrate of CYP1A2, is also permitted

          -  Certain medications that are associated with a risk for QTc prolongation and/or
             Torsades de Pointes, although not prohibited, should be avoided or replaced with
             medications that do not carry these risks, if possible

             medications/investigational product including:

               -  Any lesion, whether induced by tumor, radiation or other conditions, which makes
                  it difficult to swallow capsules or pills

               -  Prior surgical procedures affecting absorption including, but not limited to

             gastrointestinal perforation, including

               -  Active peptic ulcer disease, not on a proton pump inhibitor

               -  Known intraluminal metastatic lesions

               -  Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) or

               -  Other gastrointestinal conditions which increase the risk of perforation

               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal
                  abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment
