  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects millions of American children and increases their risk of adult obesity, a
      myriad of serious illnesses, increased healthcare costs, and premature death. It is vital to
      find ways to reverse this epidemic. Multidisciplinary behavioral weight management programs
      offer the promise of effectively treating childhood obesity. However, participants in such
      programs often find it challenging to follow recommended treatment plans and frequently drop
      out from programs without completing them. The proposed project aims to address these
      problems through frequent contact with patients between office visits. This interim contact
      will be achieved by automatically sending tailored messages to the mobile phones of
      adolescents enrolled in a multidisciplinary weight management program (the MPOWER program),
      as an adjunct to clinic visits.

      The investigators hypothesize that program participants who receive the tailored text
      messages will experience lower attrition rates, increased treatment adherence, and greater
      weight loss compared to those program participants who do not receive the messages.

    <description>For this trial adolescents will be allowed to use their own phone (with reimbursement for any study-related costs), or will be provided with a mobile phone, if requested. Participants will receive messages delivered daily over the course of 20 weeks. The content of the messages will be tailored on participants' responses to the MPOWER enrollment survey and the initial tailoring questionnaire. On school days, all messages will be sent after 3 pm (which is after school hours for most Michigan middle and high schools). Therefore, patients will not need to carry cell phones to school. The tailored messages will utilize various degrees of personalization, adaptation and feedback - including momentary assessments with feedback requiring a text reply from the adolescents.</description>
