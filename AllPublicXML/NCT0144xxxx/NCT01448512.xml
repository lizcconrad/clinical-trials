  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of combining two evidence-based interventions: a couples
      risk reduction intervention with an evidence based medication adherence intervention designed
      to enhance male participation in combination with improving medication and prevention of
      mother to child transmission (PMTCT) adherence in antenatal clinics (ANCs). Clinics will be
      randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions and effectiveness of the combined
      intervention to enhance PMTCT as well as reduce antenatal seroconversion by both individuals
      and clinics will be examined. It is hypothesized that community clinics implementing
      PartnerPlus will have more effective PMTCT program adherence, as measured by total
      participant 1) maternal and paternal ANC and PartnerPlus visits, 2) maternal and paternal
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Counseling &amp; Testing (HCT) uptake, 3) maternal and infant
      antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis uptake, 4) maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART) uptake, 5) infant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV, and 5) maternal and infant
      HIV serostatus and that community clinics implementing PartnerPlus will have reduced sexual
      risk behavior, as measured by participant sexual barrier use.

      This study is a group-randomized controlled trial using a 2 x 6 comparison (Clinic,
      Experimental, Control x Time, Baseline, Post-Intervention, Pre-delivery 32 weeks,
      Pre-delivery day, Delivery, Post Partum). Twelve community health centers (CHCs) in
      communities within the Gert Sibande and Nkangala Districts in Mpumalanga, South Africa (SA)
      will be randomly assigned to condition in a 1:1 ratio. Six usual care condition clinics will
      provide the standard of care, PMTCT; six experimental condition clinics will offer
      PartnerPlus to mothers completing HIV testing, regardless of serostatus, who are willing to
      enroll with their male partners and participate in the integrated PartnerPlus intervention.
      This study will recruit 240 couples (n = 480 individuals); community clinics will recruit 2
      cohort per clinic over 3 months (10 couples per cohort, n = 40, 120 individuals per
      condition).
