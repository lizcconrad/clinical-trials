      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two
      investigational pneumococcal vaccines at three dose levels in healthy adults.

      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two investigational pneumococcal vaccines.

      Observational Objective:

      - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the investigational pneumococcal vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An initial cohort of 6 participants will receive a single dose of one of two investigational
      pneumococcal vaccines. After safety evaluation of that cohort, additional cohorts will
      receive 2 injections 30 days apart of same investigational pneumococcal vaccine at same or
      increased dose level. All participants will be monitored for safety for 30 days after each
      vaccination.
