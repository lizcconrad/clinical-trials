  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid infusion of red blood cells is known to result in the increase of plasma potassium. The
      researchers are trying to investigate the change in plasma potassium during rapid infusion of
      mixed blood components in the reservoir of the fluid management system (FMS) in liver
      transplant recipients.

    <textblock>
      FMS is a standard equipment to prepare for the massive bleeding during the liver transplant
      surgery. This device usually delivers a mixture of red blood cell (RBC), fresh frozen plasma
      and normal saline. Rapid infusion of RBC is known to result in the increase of potassium and
      the decrease of calcium in the plasma of the patient. However there is no report about the
      consequence of rapid transfusion of the blood mixture in the reservoir of the FMS, especially
      in the liver transplantation recipients. The primary end point of this study is to
      investigate the change in the plasma potassium and to assess the possibility of hyperkalemia
      and related morbidity. Changes of blood pH and plasma calcium will also be sought.

    <time_frame>Transfusion and sampling of blood are made intraoperatively, mainly during the period of hepatectomy. Overall time of data collection is usually within 4 hrs.</time_frame>
    <description>Four units of RBC, four units of FFP and 800 ml of normal saline are put into the FMS reservoir. Samplings of blood are made before, during and after the transfusion of 300 ml of blood mixture. Sites of blood samplings are the infusion line of the FMS and the arterial and central venous lines of the patient. This process is repeated 4 times in a patient. Acquired blood samples are immediately analyzed with a point of care test device (GEM Premier 3000). The result will be analyzed with appropriate statistics such as RMANOVA.</description>

    <description>The FMS has an integrated large volume (about 3000 ml) reservoir and delivers a blood mixture (4 unit RBC, 4 unit FFP and 800 ml normal saline) put in the reservoir at a maximum rate of 750 ml/min.</description>
