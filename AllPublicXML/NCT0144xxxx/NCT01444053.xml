        Subject selection is based on a history of wearing one of two types of contact lenses for
        at least five years. Age-matching subjects into 4 age-brackets will be attempted with a
        target of five subjects in each age bracket among the two types of lenses.

             either an UV filtering contact lens or a non-UV filtering contact lens

          -  The subject must report wearing their contact lenses, on average, for a minimum of 5
             days each week.
