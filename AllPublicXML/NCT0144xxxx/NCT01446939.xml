  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson´s disease (PD) diagnosis is based upon clinical examination. Although imaging has
      helped doctors to identify many diseases, it still does not add too much information for the
      diagnosis of Parkinson´s disease. The investigators are going to perform a large sample study
      including PD patients, essential tremor and healthy volunteers in order to evaluate if MRI
      can help in the diagnosis. Our hypothesis is that fractional anisotropy (FA) in the caudal
      portion of substantia nigra is decreased in PD patients.

    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on a set of clinical assessments that do
      not provide great accuracy. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial
      sonography (TCS) have provided important advances in the diagnosis of a number of
      neurological diseases, few biomarkers of PD have been described in order to support its
      clinical diagnosis.

      Recently, one single study showed that high field MRI using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      was able discriminate PD from healthy volunteers. This study had a small sample size (14
      patients and 14 controls) and did not include the main differential diagnosis of PD.

      The main objective of this study is to confirm previous findings, with a larger sample size,
      describe possible changes of DTI parameters in patients with essential tremor (one of the
      main differential diagnosis of PD), and compare DTI MRI with TCS. Our primary outcome will be
      the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the caudal portion of substantia nigra. As a consequence,
      new algorithm to discriminate PD, essential tremor and healthy volunteers will be proposed.
      This has a pivotal importance in order to provide support to clinical diagnosis of PD and
      increase its accuracy.
