  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug cabozantinib works by inhibiting several different proteins which are believed
      to be involved in breast cancer tumor growth, its ability to spread, and its ability to form
      new blood vessels. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from
      those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent cancer growth.

      The single agent portion of this study is now closed to accrual. This research study is now
      examining the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with fulvestrant for treatment of
      hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to bone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cabozantinib will be taken orally once a day in cycles of 28 days (4 weeks). Fulvestrant will
      be given intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent cycles.

      On Day 1 of each cycle subjects will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  Performance status

        -  Physical exam

        -  Vital signs

        -  Routine blood samples

        -  Blood and urine samples to look at bone markers (Cycle 1 through 6 only)

      Subjects will also have the following additional tests and procedures:

        -  Tumor assessment by Computed Tomography (CT) scan and bone scan at Cycle 3, then every
           12 weeks

        -  Blood or urine pregnancy test (if applicable) on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, then every 12
           weeks

        -  Urine sample and blood test for thyroid function (Cycle 1, 3, 5, then every 6 weeks)

        -  Blood test for breast cancer tumor marker (Cycle 1 and 4, then every 6 weeks)

        -  Pain questionnaire and painkiller medication diary at 7-day intervals during Week 3,
           Week 6, and every 6 weeks thereafter.
