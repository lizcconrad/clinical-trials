  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the results for HIV and/or Hepatitis C Virus antibody
      testing when using routine plasma versus SMARTplasma from the same blood sample. SMARTplasma
      is enriched for antibodies via a stimulation step of whole blood in a SMARTube™ (SMARTstim™
      in the USA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following exposure to HIV and HCV, there is a &quot;window period&quot; where a person is infected with
      the virus but does not produce antibodies at a high enough level so they can be detected by
      antibody detection test methods. During this time, the person is capable of unknowingly
      transmitting the virus to others. SMARTstim (SMARTube)is a blood sample additive which
      pre-treats blood, stimulating antibody production in vitro so as to bring it to detectable
      levels using ELISA (or any other antibody test method). Accelerated antibody production
      allows antibody detection in specimens that would otherwise be below the detectable limit of
      antibody test kits. Plasma samples from blood pretreated with SMARTstim are referred to as
      &quot;SMARTplasma&quot;.

      A total of 1,600 blood samples will be collected and tested using an ELISA for HIV and HCV
      using FDA-approved test kits. The populations include:

        -  1000 samples from low risk individuals (blood donors) from 3 geographical locations

        -  500 samples from high risk individuals at risk for HIV from 2 geographical locations

        -  100 known HIV seropositives

      This is a non-linked study; that is, no subject identifiers will be associated with the
      collected blood. Subjects will not receive any correspondences and will not receive any test
      results.

      If discordant results occur between the plasma and SMARTplasma samples, those samples will be
      retested. A Western Blot will be performed on ELISA repeat reactive discordant samples. HCV
      testing using an FDA-approved assay may also be performed using retained samples.

      Simple statistical methods will be performed as necessary to analyze concordance of results
      between the sample types in the same ELISA assay.

      Secondarily, it is expected that within the scope of this study, it will be shown that:

        -  Using SMARTplasma does not adversely affect diagnostic specificity of the HIV and/or HCV
           antibody assay used; i.e., no increase in the rate of HIV or HCV false positive results.

        -  Using SMARTplasma does not adversely affect diagnostic sensitivity of the HIV and/or HCV
           antibody assay used; i.e., no decrease in the number of true positive samples.

        -  Samples from persons with early or acute infection may show a positive result when using
           SMARTplasma, while those from plasma will test negative.

        -  SMARTplasma samples using heparin or EDTA collection tubes and the correlating SMARTstim
           are comparable.

        -  SMARTplasma samples that have been frozen show comparable results to correlating
           SMARTplasma samples that have been refrigerated.

    <time_frame>Blood samples for HIV and HCV testing will be collected at time of consent (day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>There is one timepoint (day 1)for which the primary outcome measure will be assessed and data will be presented. Samples will be collected, delinked and shipped to core lab within 1 day of collection where samples will be processed and subsequently analyzed for HIV and HCV antibodies. Samples will be frozen and retained for future testing. Results of all testing of correlating SMARTplasma and normal plasma samples will be reported as either positive or negative and these results will be compared for concordance.</description>

    <description>Testing to demonstrate that SMARTplasma does not adversely affect diagnostic specificity &amp; sensitivity of the HIV or HCV antibody assay used (no increase in rate of false positives or false negatives); however,samples from persons with early or acute infection may show a positive result when tested with SMARTplasma while those from normal plasma will test negative. Results of all testing of correlating SMARTplasma and plasma samples will be reported as either positive or negative and these results will be compared for concordance.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood samples for HIV and HCV testing will be collected at time of consent (day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>Testing will determine if SMARTplasma samples from collections in heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and the correlating SMARTstim sample results are comparable. Results of all testing of correlating heparin and EDTA samples will be reported as either positive or negative and these results will be compared for concordance.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood samples for HIV and HCV testing will be collected at time of consent (day 1).</time_frame>
    <description>Following testing for HIV and HCV antibodies (primary outcome measure), an aliquot of each SMARTplasma test samples will be frozen, thawed and retested for HIV and HCV antibodies side-by-side with a corresponding fresh/refrigerated (non-frozen and thawed) sample. Testing will determine if SMARTplasma samples that have been frozen and thawed prior to testing show comparable results to correlating SMARTplasma samples that have been refrigerated. Results will be reported as either positive or negative and these results will be compared for concordance.</description>
