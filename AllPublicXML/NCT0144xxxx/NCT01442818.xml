      The investigators hypothesize that patient controlled analgesia (PCA) provides superior pain
      relief and patient satisfaction when compared to scheduled intravenous analgesia following
      vaginal reconstructive surgery.

      In order to determine if there is a significant correlation, secondary outcomes will include
      the daily and total narcotic volume used, common side effects from the opioid including
      nausea, vomiting, or pruritis, length of hospital stay, timing of flatus and first bowel
      movement, all complications, and procedure performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients will be limited to those from the Division of Urogynecology to ensure
             similar surgical techniques. They will be between the ages of 18 and 70 and undergoing
             major vaginal reconstruction.

          -  All patients must undergo vaginal reconstructive surgery including: anterior repair,
             posterior repair, and intraperitoneal vaginal vault suspension. The addition of
             vaginal hysterectomy, enterocele repair, or suburethral sling is not cause for
             exclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient who has an allergy to hydromorphone/Dilaudid.

          -  Any patient already taking chronic opioids, defined as daily use.

          -  All patients with renal insufficiency or failure.

          -  All patients with liver failure.

          -  Any patient who is not having general anesthesia.

          -  Any patient undergoing abdominal or laparoscopic procedures: sacral colpopexy,
             laparoscopic hysterectomy or oophorectomy, Burch procedure, or any procedure that
             enters the abdominal fascia.
