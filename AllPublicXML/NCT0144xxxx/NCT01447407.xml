    <textblock>
      This partially-blind, placebo controlled study is a Phase 1b study using an investigational
      vaccine, NDV-3, directed against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida sp. This study will
      compare NDV-3 administered with or without alum delivered intramuscularly (IM) at one dose
      level. It will also evaluate a lower dose of NDV-3 without alum delivered intradermally (ID)
      compared to placebo delivered ID.

      Preclinical studies in mice have established that several members of the Als family of
      proteins induce a protective immune response in mice and allow high survival rates following
      challenge with highly virulent doses of either Candida or S. aureus. Als3 (the antigen in the
      NDV-3 investigational vaccine) is the most effective member of the Als protein family in
      protecting mice from challenge with either Candida or S. aureus. The first Phase 1 study
      enrolled 40 healthy subjects that received placebo (N=10), 1 dose (N=30) or 2 doses(N=19)of
      the NDV-3 vaccine administered IM. The vaccine was well tolerated and highly immunogenic.
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of one dose of NDV-3
      vaccine formulated with and without alum given IM and also a lower dose without alum given
      ID. Subjects will have follow-up visits to assess the safety tolerability and immune
      responses at selected time points up to 90 days post-vaccination.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of NDV-3 vaccine, administered either IM with or without alum adjuvant at one dose level or ID at a lower dose level, compared to placebo. Clinical evaluations and safety laboratories will be assessed on each subject at selected time points up to 90 days post-vaccination.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is to compare the humoral and cellular immune response between the 2 dose levels, routes of administration, and effects of alum adjuvant at several time points over a 3 month period. Serum IgG and IgA1 will be evaluated by ELISA and cellular immune responses will be evaluated by ELISpot at selected timepoints up to 90 days post-vaccination.</description>

          1. Informed of the nature of the study and have agreed to and are able to read, review,
             and sign the informed consent document prior to screening. The informed consent
             document will be written in English, therefore the volunteer must have the ability to
             read and communicate in English.

          2. Completed the screening process (as described in this protocol) within 28 days prior
             to dosing.

          3. Healthy male and female volunteers 18-50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             dosing.

          4. No clinically significant deviation from normal as judged by the investigator(s) in
             the medical history, physical examination (including but may not be limited to an
             evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous
             systems), vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory
             assessments, and by general observations.

          5. Female volunteers must be one of the following:

                  judged by the Investigator(s)

               -  naturally postmenopausal (no menses) for at least 1 year and has a documented FSH
                  level ≥ 40 mIU/mL

               -  surgically postmenopausal (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)

               -  sterile (surgically [bilateral tubal ligation] or the Essure® Procedure) Female
                  volunteers that are surgically sterile or surgically postmenopausal must provide
                  documentation of the bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                  hysterectomy prior to dosing or the volunteer must agree to use a medically
                  acceptable method of birth control. The Essure® Procedure must have been inserted
                  at least 3 months prior with documentation of the Essure® confirmation test prior
                  to Period I dosing. If the procedure was inserted less than 3 months prior to
                  Period I dosing or proper documentation of the confirmation test is not provided,
                  the volunteer must agree to use an additional medically acceptable method of
