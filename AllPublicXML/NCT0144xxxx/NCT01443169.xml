  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single dose, randomized, 5-period, 5-treatment, 4-sequence
      cross-over with a fixed 5th treatment arm. Subjects will receive in a randomized sequence a
      330 mg CR tablet with fast in vitro dissolution rate, a 330 mg CR tablet with slow in vitro
      dissolution rate, a heavier 330 mg CR tablet with fast in vitro dissolution rate or a 330 mg
      market image reference CR tablet. Subjects will receive a 300mg IR formulation in the 5th
      period to to estimate and compare the % of dose absorbed versus time profile for the three CR
      prototype tablets and the CR reference tablet.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject eligibility should be reviewed and documented by an appropriately qualified
             member of the investigator's study team before subjects are included in the study.

          -  Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
             enrollment into the study:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12 lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  History of febrile illness within 5 days prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt;60 mL/min derived using the
             method of Cockcroft and Gault1.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, irritable bowel
             syndrome).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  Use of tobacco or nicotine containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use an acceptable method of contraception as outlined in this protocol from
             at least 14 days (for nonhormonal methods) or approximately 3 months (for hormonal
             contraception) prior to the first dose of study medication and for 28 days after the
             last dose of study medication.

          -  Use of prescription (other than oral, transdermal, intrauterine, implanted, or
             injected contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy) or nonprescription drugs and
             dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the
             first dose of study medication. Herbal supplements must be discontinued at least 28
             days prior to the first dose of study medication. As an exception,
             acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of 1 g/day. Limited use of
             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to pregabalin, gabapentin, or other alpha 2 delta ligands.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Previous participation in a study involving pregabalin.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Subjects with active suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior within 1 year prior to
             Screening as determined through the use of the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale) or active ideation identified at Screening or on Day 1.
