      The primary objective in this pilot study is to explore if asthma patients prescribed fixed
      dose combinations (budenosid/formoterol (Symbicort®), salmeterol/fluticasone (Seretide®),
      beclometasone/formoterol (Innovair®) are optimal treated regarding the mannitol challenge
      test and the following reversibility test.

      The primary endpoint is to identify asthma patients responding positive or negative to the
      mannitol challenge test and/or the reversibility test.

      The hypothesis is that not all patients are well treated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mannitol challenge test (Aridol™) + short-acting β2-agonist - positive response.</measure>
    <time_frame>One day only (Day 1). Subjects complete an ACT, the mannitol challenge test and the reversibility test. This is the end of the study, there is no follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>For the Primary efficacy variable, positive response Mannitol challenge test (Aridol™) followed by short-acting β2-agonist will be given as number and percentage for the ITT-population, as defined by the following: ≥15% fall in FEV1 from baseline; 10% incremental fall in FEV1 between two consecutive doses in the test; Reversibility test with a short-acting β2-agonist - increase in FEV1 of ≥15% from the last dose of mannitol in the challenge test.</description>

    <description>Patients perform an asthma control test (ACT) to establish if they are &quot;well controlled&quot; or &quot;symptomatic&quot;. All patients will perform then perform the mannitol challenge test. Aridol™ is an indirect osmotic bronchial challenge test which can be used to identify bronchial hyperresponsiveness</description>
