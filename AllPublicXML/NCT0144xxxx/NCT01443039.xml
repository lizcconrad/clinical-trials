      The activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters evolutes after Roux-en-Y gastric
      Bypass.

      Primary aim : To study the intra individual evolution of phenotypical markers of different
      drug metabolizing enzymes and one transporter (CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and
      P-gp), using a cocktail phenotypic approach, after Roux-en-Y gastric Bypass.

      Principal Judgement criteria :

      Phenotypical markers of enzymes and transporter activity before, at 5-8 weeks and 25-30 weeks
      following surgery.

      Secondary judgement criteria :

        -  Genetic polymorphisms known to affect expression and/or activity of enzymes and
           transporter.

        -  Intestinal and hepatic expression and activity of the enzymes and transporter of
           interest.

        -  Markers of inflammation Methodology, study design : open-labelled monocentric study.

      Sample size : It will be a descriptive experimental study involving 12 subjects.

      Study design : In centre 1: Inclusion at least 2 weeks prior to surgery (V0)

      In centre 2: Three studies of 12 hours each will occur (in addition with the usual clinical
      and surgical follow up) at three times periods: in the 8 weeks period before surgery (V1), at
      5-8 weeks after surgery (V2) and at 25-30 weeks after surgery (V3).

      In centre 3: the patients will undergo gastric bypass surgery (corresponding to the usual
      clinical and surgical follow up) and samples of jejunum and liver will be obtain during the
      surgery (J0).

      Centres 4 and 5 are involved in samples analysis.Hence, patients will attend 3 visits, in
      addition to the usual clinical and surgical follow-up.

      Study duration: 26 months (with duration of inclusion of 18 months)

      Duration for a patient: 38 weeks at maximum (8 months)

      Investigating center and participating units: one center enrolling the patients and three
      centers involving in the others investigations.
