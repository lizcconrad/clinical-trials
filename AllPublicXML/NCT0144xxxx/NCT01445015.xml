      The study will utilize a stress management program delivered over 10 sessions that is
      hypothesized to result in decreased stress levels and improved coping strategies in an inner
      city adolescent asthma population. Participants will include adolescents ages 10-15 years
      with physician diagnosed asthma. The outcome measures will be obtained via psychosocial
      questionnaires and spirometry.
