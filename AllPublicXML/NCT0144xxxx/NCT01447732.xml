  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase 1 open label, multi-center, dose escalation study of
      CEP-37250/KHK2804 as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond
      to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, a standard 3+3 designed dose escalation
      phase, subjects will receive CEP-37250/KHK2804, administered iv, once every week. A treatment
      cycle will consists of total of four doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will enroll
      subjects with either colon cancer or pancreatic cancer to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 at a dose
      to be determined following completion of Part 1.

      All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of
      unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator
      decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of
      CEP-37250/KHK2804 therapy, the subject may continue to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 after
      discussion with the Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best
      response of at least stable disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities
      or dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

    <description>Part 1 is based on the CEP-37250/KHK2804 tolerability and safety data from three subjects enrolled in a cohort, enrollment at the next dose level or additional subjects into the ongoing cohort will occur based upon the number subjects with DLT at a given dose level. Dose depends on subject's body weight. Part 1 includes intervention of CEP-37250/KHK2804.
Part 2 will receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 at a dose to be determined following completion of Part 1.</description>

             measurable, unresectable, locally advanced primary or recurrent, metastatic solid
             tumor, locally advanced primary or recurrent, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
             must have received at least one prior treatment regimen containing gemcitabine or

                  system [CNS] involvement or past history of treated brain metastasis). Subjects
                  with treated brain metastasis (radiotherapy and/or surgery) will be eligible if

             treatment start date;

          -  Are neurologically stable;

          -  Are on corticosteroids in doses no greater than physiological replacement (e.g.,
             dexamethasone &lt; 1.5 mg/day); and

          -  Have a screening MRI scan of the brain that specifically verifies no evidence of CNS
             hemorrhage and no active gadolinium enhancing lesions;

          -  Subjects with primary brain/CNS malignancy (e.g., gliomas, lymphomas) are excluded.

               -  Hypersensitivity reaction to monoclonal antibodies, other therapeutic proteins,

                  reaction could not be controlled or prevented on subsequent infusion with
                  standard therapies such as antihistamines, 5-HT3 antagonists, or corticosteroids.
