    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is one of the most common genetic causes of obesity. Obesity is a
      major source of morbidity and mortality in this population. It can lead to sleep apnea, cor
      pulmonale, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. PWS has distinct characteristics that set
      it apart from other forms of obesity including insatiable appetite and food-seeking behavior
      which can be disruptive to home and school activities, and can cause severe social and
      psychological turmoil within families. PWS is also associated with unique hormonal
      abnormalities, most notably hyperghrelinemia. Ghrelin is a gut hormone produced in the
      stomach that stimulates food intake during a fast. It is hypothesized that the extremely high
      ghrelin levels in patients with PWS may cause or contribute to their insatiable appetite.
      Exenatide, a medication used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, appears
      to suppress ghrelin levels and cause weight loss. It was designed to mimic glucagon-like
      peptide 1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and delays gastric
      emptying, among other effects. In the present study, the investigators will investigate the
      effects of a 6 month trial of exenatide in overweight adolescents with PWS. The investigators
      will quantify the changes in weight and body composition, as well as subjective measures of
      appetite, and concentrations of appetite-associated hormones. The investigators hypothesize
      that exenatide will improve weight, body composition, appetite, and plasma ghrelin levels
      during the treatment period.

      BACKGROUND:

      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with hyperphagia and hyperghrelinemia with major
      morbidity because of obesity without effective medical treatment targeting hyperphagia.
      Exenatide (Byetta [synthetic Exendin-4]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington DE) is a GLP-1 receptor
      agonist which reduces appetite and weight and may be an effective treatment in PWS.

      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a 6-month trial of
      exenatide on appetite, weight and gut hormones in youth with PWS.

    <description>Prior to analysis, distributions were evaluated for normality and natural log transformation was performed to analyse data not normally distributed. Data are presented as mean ±SD unless not normally distributed, in which case they are presented as median with intra-quartile ranges (25th and 75th percentiles). Within-subject changes between visits were analysed by mixed model repeated measures. When the overall F-test for difference among visits was significant, Dunnett-adjusted pairwise comparisons were made between baseline and each subsequent visit.</description>

        <description>Prior to analysis, distributions were evaluated for normality and natural log transformation was performed to analyse data not normally distributed. Data are presented as mean ±SD unless not normally distributed, in which case they are presented as median with intra-quartile ranges (25th and 75th percentiles). Within-subject changes between visits were analysed by mixed model repeated measures. When the overall F-test for difference among visits was significant, Dunnett-adjusted pairwise comparisons were made between baseline and each subsequent visit.</description>

11 item questionnaire divided into subcategories of behavior (5 questions), drive (4 questions), severity (2 questions). Tallied and analyzed as total and subcategory scores. Each question scored 1-5 with higher scores correlating with worse hyperphagia.
Possible ranges: Total 11-55, behavior 5-25, drive 4-20, severity 2-10</description>

Exenatide: The investigators will give patients naive to GLP-1 agonists exenatide per manufacturer dosing recommendations for 6 months. The investigators will begin by giving 5 mcg subcutaneously twice a day for 1 month and then increase the dose to 10 mcg subcutaneously twice a day for the remainder of the study (5 months).</description>
