      Aim 1:

      Determine if there is an association between the APOL1 risk variants and allograft survival
      and function in African Americans

      Aim 2:

      Determine if there is an association between the presence of APOL1 risk variants in an
      African American kidney transplant recipient and the risk of recurrent disease

      Aim 3:

      Investigate mechanisms of APOL1 associated kidney disease by prospectively following African
      American kidney transplant recipients throughout their clinical course.

      Aims 1 and 2:

      Subjects will collect a saliva specimen in an Oragene®•DNA sample collection kit for
      genotyping. We will also collected any discarded (no longer utilized for clinical purposes)
      tissue from biopsies.

      Aim 3:

      Prior to transplant, subjects will collect saliva in an Oragene®•DNA sample collection kit
      for genotyping and 10cc of blood will be drawn into a Na heparin collection tube for APOL1
      protein analysis. When applicable, plasmapheresis effluent will be collected. We will also
      collected any discarded (no longer utilized for clinical purposes)tissue from biopsies.
