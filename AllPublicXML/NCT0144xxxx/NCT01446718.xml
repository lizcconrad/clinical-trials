      The purpose of this study is to determine sustained immunogenicity of the quadrivalent
      vaccine 'Gardasil', 48 months after initial vaccination, among HIV-1 infected boys and girls
      age 9-14 years. This age range is within the World Health Organization (WHO) stipulated
      guidelines for national programs for the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected individuals bear a disproportionate disease burden of HPV-related diseases
      suggesting more rapid progression from HPV acquisition to malignancy. HIV infected women have
      a 2-22 fold increased risk for cervical cancer compared to uninfected women. The quadrivalent
      HPV vaccine marketed as &quot;Gardasil&quot; has demonstrated efficacy against type specific HPV
      infections known to cause 70% cervical cancer (HPV 16 &amp; 18) and HPV 6 &amp; 11 known to cause 90%
      of anogenital warts in populations of HIV negative young women.

      Since the risk of HPV exposure persists throughout a person's sexual life, the duration of
      protection, especially when the vaccine is given in the pre-adolescent period, is critical to
      overall vaccine effectiveness. Extended follow up of HIV-uninfected individuals has shown
      sustained response to HPV vaccine for 8.4 and 6 years respectively to the bivalent and
      quadrivalent vaccines. However, other vaccines such as the hepatitis B vaccine have been
      shown to require additional dosages to be effective among HIV-infected persons.

      Data on immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine among HIV infected adolescents is limited to a 12
      month follow up period.

      Current HPV vaccine guidelines target pre-sexual adolescents. Since the risk of HPV exposure
      persists throughout an individual's sexual life, the duration of protection provided by
      vaccination is critical to the overall vaccine effectiveness. Duration of sustained HPV
      6/11/16/18 antibody response is directly related to vaccine effectiveness and determines the
      need for booster dosing.

      The investigators therefore propose to extend follow up of 179 girls and boys in Kenya, age
      9-14 years who have received 3 doses of the quadrivalent 'Gardasil' vaccine and assess for
      immunogenicity annually.
