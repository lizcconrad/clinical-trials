      Primary objective:

      Determine the impact of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) on the treatment recommendation
      made (administration of chemotherapy or not, in addition to hormonotherapy) in a HR+, N- or
      pN1(mi), Her2- breast cancer adjuvant population.

      The impact of Oncotype DX on treatment recommendations can be either a decrease in treatment
      intensity defined as a change in treatment recommendation from chemotherapy plus hormonal
      therapy to hormonal therapy alone or an increase in treatment intensity defined as a movement
      from hormonal therapy alone to the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy.

      Patients with HR+, N- breast cancer currently represent around 70% of newly diagnosed breast
      cancers. These are usually good prognosis tumors. However, on the basis of classical clinical
      and pathological prognostic parameters and markers, the international consensus guidelines
      recommend treatment with hormone- and chemotherapy in 85-95% of the cases. Considering the
      natural disease history, such as documented by the EBCTCG meta-analysis, more than 50% of
      these patients are overtreated, which leads to unnecessary side effects and costs to the
      health system and to the society.

      Oncotype DX appears to be well adapted to therapeutic de-escalation as it targets HR+, N-
      patients and is performed on fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FPET). It is therefore best
      adapted to daily clinical practice as it does not necessitate any specific surgical procedure
      or tissue freezing.

      The prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype DX in ER+, N- patients has been validated on
      three large adjuvant randomized trials (NASBP B-14, NSABP B-20, and the ATAC study). The test
      has been commercially available in the USA since 2004, and is being used for more than 50% of
      the HR+ N- patients in this country.

      While Oncotype DX has been validated in the USA, it needs to be independently evaluated in
      France, in the context of the local treatment guidelines and habits, to provide data that are
      meaningful to the French health system and to the French medical community.
