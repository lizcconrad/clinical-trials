        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Serum LDL-C levels&gt;100 mg/dL at screening visit.

          -  Male or female subject, between 18 and 65 years inclusive.

          -  Body weight between 50.0 and 95.0 kg inclusive if male, between 40.0 kg and 85.0 kg
             inclusive if female, body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/mÂ² inclusive.

          -  Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history
             and complete physical examination).

          -  Normal vital signs after 10 minutes resting in supine position.

          -  Normal standard 12-lead ECG after 10 minutes resting in supine position.

          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range, unless the Investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects.

          -  If female, subject must use a double contraception method, except if she is sterilized
             for more than 3 months or postmenopausal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects indicated for the use of statins according to criteria in National
             Cholesterol Education Program adult treatment panel III Guidelines, as updated in 2004
             (see Appendix C).

          -  Initiation of a new diet or major change to a previous diet within 4 weeks prior to
             Screening (Day -21 to -2). Subjects must be willing to maintain a consistent diet for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Use of a medication or nutraceutical in order to alter serum lipids within 4 weeks
             prior to screening (Day -21 to -2), including but not limited to statins, ezetimibe,
             fibrates, niacin, or omega-3 fatty acids, bile acid resins.

          -  Fasting serum triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL measured after an 8 to 12 hour fast.

          -  History of a hypersensitivity reaction to doxycycline or similar compound.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
