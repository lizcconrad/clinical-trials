    <time_frame>0-48 hr after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from time 0 to the last measurable concentration, as calculated by the linear/log trapezoidal method will be summarized by treatment and genotype group using descriptive statistics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure of the subjects who administered atenolol according to the SLCO2B1 genotypes</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 hr after drug admnistration</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure measurement will be presented as descriptive statistics for the difference from baseline where appropriate.</description>

    <time_frame>0-48 hr after drug admnistration</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with adverse event as a measure of safety and tolerability
*Measure of safety and tolerability: physical examinations, ECG, Laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, urinalysis)
- Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data as well as for the difference from baseline where appropriate.</description>
