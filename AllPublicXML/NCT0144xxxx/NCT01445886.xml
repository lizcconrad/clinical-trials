  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of indigo naturalis oil
      extract and calcipotriol solution in the treatment of psoriatic nails, to show that indigo
      naturalis oil extract may be a good choice for treating nail psoriasis, and potentially an
      effective alternative for those who do not respond well to traditional therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in treating nail psoriasis is
      rarely reported. Recently, the investigators developed a new product, indigo naturalis oil
      extract, which worked well in nail disease. In our randomized, observer-blind,
      vehicle-controlled trial showed that indigo naturalis oil extract is effective and safe in
      treating nail psoriasis. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of indigo
      naturalis oil extract with calcipotriol solution in patients with nail psoriasis using
      controlled, bilateral comparison

      The investigators will enroll 32 patients with nail psoriasis from the ambulatory department
      of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Indigo naturalis oil extract will be consistently applied on
      either the left or right affected nail folds, while calcipotriol will be applied on the
      opposite side, both twice daily for 24 weeks, allowing intra-patient comparison. The nails
      will be assessed by two dermatologists before treatment and at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.
