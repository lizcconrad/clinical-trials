      The purpose of this study is to compare three different core build-up materials for dental
      use. The study hypothesis is that there is no differences in survival rate of the different
      core build-ups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Core build-ups replace dental structures which are decayed through caries or tooth fractures.
      Often there are necessary before insertion of dental restorations. In clinical practice,
      there are two main material groups: glass ionomer cements and composites. Because of there
      good physical properties the composite materials claimed to fulfill the expected criteria of
      core build-ups. However, some of these composite core build-ups get lost before insertion of
      definite prosthetic restorations. The current prospective, randomized controlled study should
      investigate the survival rate of three different composite materials: &quot;Rebilda DC&quot;, &quot;Clearfil
      Core DC&quot; and &quot;Multicore Flow&quot;. The statistical analysis will performed with logistic
      regression performed by the institute of institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics,
      university of heidelberg. The study hypothesis is that there is no differences in the
      survival rate.
