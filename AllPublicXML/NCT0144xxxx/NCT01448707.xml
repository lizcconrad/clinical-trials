      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg monotherapy with a triple combination therapy containing
      darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg and 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (N[t]RTIs) in approximately 260 Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients who
      have been on Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) medication and have a plasma Viral
      Load below 50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks. Also the changes in neurocognitive function
      will be compared throughout the study.

      This is phase IIIb, randomised (study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (both the
      patient and the study physician will know to which treatment group the patient is assigned)
      trial to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv)
      800/100 mg once daily monotherapy with a triple combination therapy containing DRV/rtv
      800/100 mg once daily and an investigator-selected background of 2 other anti-HIV drugs of
      the class nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). The
      investigator-selected N[t]RTIs is a dual combination of either be abacavir (ABC), lamivudine
      (3TC), zidovudine (AZT), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or emtricitabine (FTC).
      Approximately 260 HIV-1 infected patients, who have received HAART for at least 48 weeks,
      have not changed their treatment within the last 8 weeks, and who have documented evidence of
      plasma viral load (plasma HIV-1 RNA) below 50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks prior to being
      screened, participate in the study. The study period includes a screening period of maximum 6
      weeks, a 4-week run-in period, a 96 week treatment period, followed by a 4 weeks follow-up
      period. According to the original protocol, at the start of the 4-week run-in period all
      patients replaced their 3rd agent (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), protease
      inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitor) of the HAART medication with DRV/rtv and continued
      with the 2 N[t]RTIs. After 4 weeks the patient was randomly assigned (like flipping a coin)
      to either the monotherapy group or the triple therapy group. If assigned to the monotherapy
      group, the 2 N[t]RTIs were stopped and only DRV/rtv was continued. If assigned to the triple
      therapy group, DRV/rtv were continued together with 2 N[t]RTIs, which can be the same as
      already taken or are switched to new N[t]RTIs. Based on the primary efficacy analysis after
      Week 48, the protocol was amended such that subjects in the monotherapy arm who entered the
      study with a nadir CD4+ count of &lt;200 cells/μL will also receive 2 N[t]RTIs (ie, triple
      therapy) as soon as possible.

      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that DRV/rtv monotherapy is as effective as
      a triple combination therapy containing DRV/rtv and 2N[t]RTIs. In addition, the study looks
      at overall safety and tolerability between the two treatment groups. During the study,
      patients' health are monitored by physical examination, checking of vital signs (blood
      pressure / pulse), and laboratory testing on blood and urine samples. Also blood samples are
      drawn to measure the antiviral effectiveness (i.e., decrease of the plasma viral load to a
      level &lt;50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) and immunology assessments (to assess the body's immune
      system). A battery of neurocognitive function tests is performed during the study visits. A
      sub-study takes place in selected hospitals. Approximately 100 patients have 2 additional
      tests done, at the start of the run-in phase and after 48-weeks of randomisation. For this
      substudy a lumbar puncture (extraction of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] from the spinal canal)
      for laboratory testing (antiviral effectiveness, pharmacokinetic analysis, biochemistry and
      immune markers) and an additional blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis (to measure the
      drug level in blood) is taken. The study hypothesis is that, after 48 weeks of randomised
      treatment, DRV/rtv monotherapy is as effective as the triple therapy containing DRV/rtv plus
      2 N[t]RTIs. Two 400 mg tablets of darunavir and one 100 mg tablet ritonavir are taken
      together once daily orally within 30 minutes after completion of a meal, for 100 weeks. The
      intake of the investigator-selected N[t]RTIs as according the local prescribing information.

Results were summarized based on individual treatment received: Darunavir resistance mutations, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations, protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations, PR mutations, RT mutations, extended NNRTI mutations, primary PI mutations.</description>
