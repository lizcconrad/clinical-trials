    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine and compare electroencephalography (EEG) changes in
      human subjects directly after inhalation of essential oils from five Thai aromatherapies. The
      investigators hypothesize that essential oils from Thai aromatherapies may influence the
      human EEG involving emotional relaxation particularly alpha wave EEG.

      The subjects consisted of 22 male and 26 female subjects , ages between 20 to 30 years (mean
      age, 23.3 years). They were screened for excessive nasal congestion, drug and food taken, and
      neurological disorders prior to participation in the experiment. The experiments were
      approved by the Ethical Committee for Research Involving Human Research Subject, Naresuan
      University. All subjects read and signed an informed consent before participation.

    <description>Experimental procedures were conducted in the morning. Subjects individually entered the closed room where the temperature was kept at 25-26 oC and humidity 50-60%. The subjects were blinded using mask and were seated comfortably with eyes closed during experimental period. The EEG was recorded using silver electrodes. EEG activity was monitored 4 areas (F7, F8, T3 and T4) and ground electrodes. The experiments were divided into 3 parts. The first part, no-odor were recorded EEG activity for 10 minutes as a baseline. The second part, subject was exposure to the odor for 10 minutes as during inhalation. The last part, the odor was dispersed and assessed EEG activity for 10 minutes as after inhalation.</description>
