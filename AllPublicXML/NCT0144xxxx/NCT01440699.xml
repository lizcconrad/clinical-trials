  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose-derived stem cells have properties of differentiation to various types of cells,
      immunomodulatory effects. adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) show also low immunogenicity.

      Anterogen has developed ANTG-ASC(Autologous ASC) which has shown good efficacy and safety in
      Phase I and II study on the patients with Crohn's fistula.

      However, Crohn's patients are sometimes not fat enough to extract fat tissue for culturing
      ASCs. Therefore the investigators have planned to study allogenic ASCs for safety and
      efficacy in patients with Crohn's fistula.
