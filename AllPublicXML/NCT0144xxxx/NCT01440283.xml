  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High risk neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive, prevalent non-brain cancer derived from nerve
      cells of the body. It mostly affects infants, and more children die from this tumor each year
      than are cured. Standard therapy includes a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, bone marrow
      transplant, radiation and immunotherapy. NB is very sensitive to radiation, but due to it's
      aggressive spread pattern, radiation use is currently limited by toxicity. This study seeks
      to improve delivery of radiation to reduce toxicity by quantifying outcomes, and measuring
      differences in renal toxicity and organ motion so that radiation can be focused more
      effectively against tumor while sparing normal tissues and reducing side-effects.

      Patients with high-risk abdominal neuroblastoma who receive any high-risk neuroblastoma
      treatment regimen will be eligible to enroll prior to surgical resection of the primary
      tumor. Following implantation of fiducial markers within the tumor bed and autologous
      hematopoietic rescue, patients will begin the planning process for abdominal irradiation;
      this requires multiple baseline studies, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), renal scintigraphy, and bloodwork. Most of these tests will be
      repeated on a varying schedule over the five year follow-up period of the protocol, in order
      to evaluate the impact of conformal radiotherapy on intra-abdominal tissues.

      Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery will follow current conventional
      volume-targeting guidelines, however, appropriate application within the abdomen will be
      determined by ascertaining intra-abdominal organ motion and the potential for reducing normal
      tissue dose, while simultaneously increasing dose delivered to target tissues, particularly
      when dose escalation for gross residual disease is required. Concurrent neuro-hormonal tests,
      cytokine analyses, functional and morphologic imaging will generate novel data describing the
      acute and chronic effects of radiotherapy within the abdomen.

      NOTE: This study is currently closed to accrual, however, it is expected to re-open to
      accrual later in 2015.

    <description>Normal tissue motion-defining measurements were obtained which can guide future more conformal therapeutic regimens incorporating smaller volumes of uninvolved tissue. Participants underwent CT simulation and 4D-CT acquisition as well as real-time dynamic 4D MRI prior to the start of radiation therapy (RT), and a subsequent repeat 4D-CT was obtained approximately 2 weeks after the start of RT. The imaging position was supine with general anesthesia. Renal edges were marked in a customized graphical interface for each imaging series with the image resolution determining the minimum motion extent. Vectors of renal edge motion were quantified in the anterior-posterior (A-P), medial-lateral (M-L), and superior-inferior (S-I) dimensions. The motion extent derived from the MRI dataset was considered in defining the margins for RT treatment planning.</description>

                  applicable high-risk neuroblastoma regimen. Slight variations from this timeframe
                  are acceptable based on recovery of blood counts or other concerns left to the
                  discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.

               -  Patients receiving surgical management elsewhere are still considered eligible to
                  enroll on protocol therapy for assessment of the primary local control objective,
                  renal motion and toxicity assessment. Target motion objectives may be excluded
                  from the analysis of these patients.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who have received prior definitive radiotherapy at or adjacent to the primary
             abdominal tumor bed.

             tomography (4DCT), computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging- (MRI)-based
             imaging procedures.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases.

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable or
             uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease).

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Mediastinal primary tumors.

          -  Patients receiving surgery elsewhere, or at St. Jude within 3 months prior to study
             activation, are excluded from assessment of target and motion objectives. However they
             are still eligible to enroll for assessment of the primary objective, renal motion and
             toxicity.

            <description>Patients with high-risk abdominal neuroblastoma who receive any high-risk neuroblastoma treatment regimen were eligible to enroll prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor. Following implantation of fiducial markers within the tumor bed and autologous hematopoietic rescue, patients began the planning process for abdominal irradiation.
Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) delivery followed current conventional volume-targeting guidelines, however, appropriate application within the abdomen was determined by ascertaining intra-abdominal organ motion and the potential for reducing normal tissue dose, while simultaneously increasing dose delivered to target tissues, particularly when dose escalation for gross residual disease was required.</description>

        <title>Quantify the Range of Organ Movement During the Breathing Phase Measured by 4-dimensional MRI (4DMRI) and 4DCT.</title>
        <description>Normal tissue motion-defining measurements were obtained which can guide future more conformal therapeutic regimens incorporating smaller volumes of uninvolved tissue. Participants underwent CT simulation and 4D-CT acquisition as well as real-time dynamic 4D MRI prior to the start of radiation therapy (RT), and a subsequent repeat 4D-CT was obtained approximately 2 weeks after the start of RT. The imaging position was supine with general anesthesia. Renal edges were marked in a customized graphical interface for each imaging series with the image resolution determining the minimum motion extent. Vectors of renal edge motion were quantified in the anterior-posterior (A-P), medial-lateral (M-L), and superior-inferior (S-I) dimensions. The motion extent derived from the MRI dataset was considered in defining the margins for RT treatment planning.</description>
