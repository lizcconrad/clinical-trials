    <textblock>
      This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of bosentan when administered to
      thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)patients. A clinical pilot study was
      designed,included in which patients with ulcer and/or pain at rest were treated with bosentan
      p.o at a dose of 62,5 mg twice daily during the first month, which each thereafter uptitrated
      to 125 mg twice daily. Study endpoints were clinical improvement rate, major or minor
      amputation rate, hemodynamic changes, changes in endothelial function and angiographic
      changes.

      12 patients were included were current smokers. With bosentan treatment, no new ischemic
      lesions were observed in all but one patient. Overall, clinical improvement was observed in
      12 of the 13 extremities (92%). Only two of 13 extremities underwent amputation after
      bosentan treatment. As assessed by digital arteriography with subtraction or angio-magnetic
      resonance image an increase of distal flow was observed in 10 out of the 12 patients. All
      patients experienced a statistically significant improvement in their BAFMD values (means:1.8
      at baseline;6.6 at the end of the treatment;12.7 three months after the end of the
      treatment;p&lt;0.01). In conclusion: Bosentan treatment may result in an improvement of
      clinical, angiographic, hemodynamic and endothelial function outcome. Bosentan deserves
      further investigation in the management TAO patients.

    <description>Bosentan therapy consisted of a month's treatment with 62.5 mg bid orally administered. Dose doubled to 125 mg bid after the first month. The full-dose regimen (125 mg/12h) was maintained for the following months or until total healing fo the ulcers.</description>
