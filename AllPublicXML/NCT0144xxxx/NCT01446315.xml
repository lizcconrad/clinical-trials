  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common problem among US adults and children. Unfortunately many people with
      asthma continue to suffer from asthma symptoms that could be control with better asthma care
      and more attention to details such as triggers, and adherence. To date the only tools
      available and recommended by groups such as the national asthma guideline group consider only
      asthma burden and do not include information on the most common factors that adversely affect
      asthma control. This study provides one half of the enrolled primary care offices with the
      Asthma APGAR which is a system of patient completed questions and a care flow sheet. The
      other half of the enrolled practices will continue to provide &quot;usual&quot; care without the
      support of the Asthma APGAR system. The research questions is whether or not asthma control
      and asthma related quality of life will be improved in people with asthma who are cared for
      in the intervention practices that use the Asthma APGAR system.

      Since this is a practice intervention study, the practices are randomized and all patients
      enrolled within each practice receive either the intervention based care or the usual care.

      The primary outcome is asthma related quality of life obtained from patient report. Other
      outcomes include asthma control, also a patient reported outcome, and number of exacerbations
      which is obtained from patient medical record review.
