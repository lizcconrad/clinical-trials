  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is expected to affect about 30
      million North Americans and Europeans by 2050. Atrial fibrillation is associated with
      increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with stroke being an especially important
      and potentially devastating complication. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of
      different drugs in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. There are numerous
      randomized controlled trials that have tested the efficacy of agents against placebo and some
      trials that directly compared the efficacy of two or more different drugs. The class III
      antiarrhythmic drug Ibutilde is approved for the acute termination of atrial fibrillation and
      atrial flutter of recent onset and has been shown to be superior to sotalol and equivalent to
      flecainide in this indication. Recently, the relatively atrial selective antiarrhythmic agent
      vernakalant has been approved by the European Commission for the rapid conversion of recent
      onset AF to sinus rhythm in adults. The investigators hypothesize that the period of time
      needed for cardioversion to sinus rhythm and the efficacy of cardioversion within 90 minutes
      is different between vernakalant and ibutilide in patients with recent-onset atrial
      fibrillation.
