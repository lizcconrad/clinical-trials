  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporary pancreatic duct stent placement during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been recommended for post-endoscopic pancreatitis (PEP)
      prophylaxis in high risk patients, including those in whom accidental pancreatic duct
      cannulation has occurred. However, the optimal duration of stent placement remains an open
      question. The investigators aim is to assess if immediate stent removal is effective in the
      prevention of PEP after accidental pancreatic duct cannulation.

    <textblock>
      Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials confirmed that pancreatic stent
      placement after ERCP reduces the risk of PEP but the optimal duration of stent placement
      remains an open question. It has been suggested that in truly high-risk patients the
      pancreatic stent must be left in place for a minimum of 24 hours or more whereas in patients
      at lesser risk pancreatic duct drainage probably only needs to be maintained for a few hours
      or less. Leaving the stent in place at the end of the ERCP procedure carries the disadvantage
      of radiological follow-up until spontaneous dislodgment occurs or endoscopic removal is
      deemed timely; moreover, proximal migration has been reported, requiring endoscopic or even
      surgical removal. There is a paucity of data comparing immediate removal with spontaneous
      dislodgment in high-risk patients. In one study, significantly higher rates of PEP were
      detected in patients in whom a pancreatic stent was removed immediately at the end of the
      ERCP procedure than in those in whom the stent was left in place: unfortunately, only
      patients undergoing a precut sphincterotomy were evaluated in that study which was published
      only in abstract form. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether leaving a stent in place is
      more effective than immediate removal in preventing PEP in high-risk patients.

    <description>Post-endoscopic pancreatitis is defined as pancreatic pain and hyperamylasemia within 24 hours of the procedure and is assessed by a physician blinded to group assignment and to radiological surveillance findings. Pancreatic pain is defined as severe and persistent pain in the epigastric or periumbilical region. Hyperamylasemia is defined as an increase in the serum amylase level to greater than 3 times the upper normal limit. The pancreatitis is defined as mild, moderate, or severe according to the criteria proposed by Cotton et al. (GE 1991).</description>
