  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancies complicated by diabetes and mild gestational hyperglycemia are associated with
      increased perinatal and maternal complications. The most serious maternal complication is the
      risk of developing type 2 diabetes after 10-12 years of the delivery. Perinatal complications
      include fetal macrosomia with consequent increased risk of obstetrical trauma and
      hypoxia/asphyxia, high rates of cesarean section, respiratory distress syndrome, and
      metabolic disorders at birth. Regardless of the diagnosis of diabetes and mild gestational
      hyperglycemia, the perinatal outcome is directly related to maternal metabolic control. For
      the tight control of blood glucose, pregnant women are treated as home care (outpatient) or
      hospital care. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and safety of home versus
      hospital care of gestational diabetes and mild gestational hyperglycemia.

    <description>Home care, sometimes called &quot;ambulatory care&quot; or &quot;outpatient&quot;, was defined as the blood-glucose self-monitored by the pregnant women at home. This project will provide glucometers to all those who are randomized to home care. The women will receive training for glucose control in pre-defined days, with the glucometer to obtain the mean glucose. According to blood-glucose levels in glycemic profile, insulin dose will be maintained or altered both in gestational diabetes as in mild gestational hyperglycemia .</description>

    <description>Hospital care, sometimes called &quot;acute care&quot;, was defined as control of maternal diabetes made at hospitals by admission to hospital. The blood-glucose and metabolic control are done in gestational diabetes and mild gestational hyperglycemia treated conventionally.
The hospitalized patients will have their glycemic control done in the hospital. . According to blood-glucose levels in glycemic profile , insulin dose will be maintained or altered both in gestational diabetes as in mild gestational hyperglycemia.
All the women of the study will be accompanied by a team of obstetricians specializing in high-risk pregnancies; residents; dietitians; nurses and neonatologists.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were diagnosed with gestational, pre gestational diabetes mellitus or
             mild gestational hyperglycemia. Patients should have one of the four criteria as
             following:

          -  Patients with positive screening for GDM presenting a TTG of 75 g and one of the
             values below:

               -  fasting glucose ≥ 92;

               -  1h ≥ 180; or

               -  2h ≥ 153 will be considered gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and these
                  patients will be enrolled to a run-in phase consisting of diet and exercise
                  during 15 days. If the patients still present an abnormal glycemic profile
                  instead of the previous treatment with diet and exercise they will be enrolled in
                  the study and randomized to either home or hospital care; or

          -  Patients with pre gestational diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2; or

          -  Patients with positive screening for GDM and presenting normal TTG of 75 g and
             abnormal glycemic profile, fasting ≥ 85 mg k/l 10 h to 18h post prandial ≥ 130 mg k/ (
             Rudge et al,1990).

          -  Normal TTG and an abnormal glycemic profile will be considered as mild gestational
             hyperglycemia

          -  Patient provided written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Twin pregnancy diagnosed until the date of randomization or;

          -  Fetal malformation diagnosed until the date of randomization.
