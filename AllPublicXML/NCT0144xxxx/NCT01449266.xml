      To evaluate the dialysability of Dotarem®, after an IV injection of 0.1 mmol/kg in patients
      with chronic renal failure who require hemodialysis treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten adult patients suffering from end stage renal failure and requiring hemodialysis
      treatment for 3 times were enrolled. Patients received a single dose of Dotarem® at 0.1
      mmol/kg before being submitted to hemodialysis to assess the dialysability of Dotarem® .
      After injection of Dotarem®, 3 sessions of hemodialysis were performed as follows:

      The first hemodialysis session started between 1 to 2 h after the injection; The second
      hemodialysis session occurred 2 days (i.e., 48 ± 2 h) after the Dotarem® injection; The third
      hemodialysis session occurred 4 days (i.e., 96 ± 4 h) after the Dotarem® injection.

      The decrease in serum Dotarem® concentration was assessed after each hemodialysis session.
      Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, injection-site tolerance, and
      laboratory assessments.Two safety follow-up visits were performed: one 3 weeks (± 2 days) and
      one 3 months (± 4 days) after the Dotarem® injection.
