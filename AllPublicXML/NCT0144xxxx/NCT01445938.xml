      Primary Objective:

      To assess the antiparasitic activity of intramuscular (IM) SAR97276A based on parasite
      reduction ratio at 72 hours in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the evolution of clinical signs and symptoms (including the need for a rescue
           therapy) in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria receiving SAR97276A with
           reference to Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapy (ACTs)

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics profile of SAR97276A in pediatric patients with
           uncomplicated malaria

        -  To assess the safety profile of SAR97276A in pediatric patients with uncomplicated
           malaria

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of SAR97276A
