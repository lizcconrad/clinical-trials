  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of Degarelix, a Luteinizing Hormone Releasing
      Hormone (LHRH) antagonist, to reduce prostate volume prior to permanent seed prostate
      brachytherapy. There are 2 eligible populations of men, all of whom will have selected
      brachytherapy as their treatment of choice for their prostate cancer. Either they have an
      enlarged prostate that requires size reduction to render brachytherapy technically feasible,
      or they require androgen ablation in conjunction with brachytherapy for optimal tumor
      control. The hypothesis is that Degarelix will provide &gt; 30% volume reduction by 3 months in
      &gt; 30% of men.

  <detailed_description>

      All men will have a baseline transrectal ultrasound for brachytherapy planning that has
      demonstrated an enlarged prostate with or without pubic arch obstruction. After signing the
      informed consent document they will have a loading dose of 240 mg Degarelix and then monthly
      maintenance dose injections of 80 mg until such time as sufficient prostate reduction has
      occured (2-3 months) or they complete the 6 months of required androgen ablation for their
      disease status.

    <description>Men in this arm have chosen brachytherapy for management of localized prostate cancer and do not require androgen ablation for oncologic reasons but have an enlarged prostate causing pubic arch interference and thus require prostate size reduction prior to brachytherapy. They will have 2-3 months of Degarelix with measurement of prostate volume at 8 and 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Men in this arm have higher risk prostate cancer (upper tier intermediate risk by National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines) and require 6 months of androgen ablation in conjunction with brachytherapy. Prostate size must be &gt; 40 cc at baseline so that prostate size reduction measurements are appropriate. Prostate measurements by transrectal ultrasound with be taken at 12 weeks and 20 weeks.</description>
