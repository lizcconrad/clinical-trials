  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine contraception is a very effective, long term, reversible form of birth control,
      and is increasingly used in young, nulliparous patients. However, there is potential for pain
      with insertion of an Intrauterine Device (IUD) - particularly in patients without a previous
      history of vaginal delivery. The potential pain associated with insertion is often a
      significant barrier for patients when choosing and IUD for contraception. Several methods of
      pain control have been studied, but none have been shown to reduce pain at time of insertion.
      Our research question is to determine if 2% topical lidocaine gel, instilled into the
      cervical canal, will reduce maximum pain at time of insertion of a popular IUD (Mirena
      Intrauterine System) in young, nulliparous patients. This will be studied in a randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

    <description>The investigators plan to engage 40 patients in this study, and will ask each to fill out a questionnaire that covers age, ethnicity, pregnancy history, reason for IUD insertion and recent medication use. Patients will be asked to assess their pain on 3 separate occasions during the visit, by marking an X on a Visual Analog Scale. Providers will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire covering their experience with the interventions as well as their assessment of the patients' pain during the procedures.</description>

    <description>During the procedure (placement of the IUD), 1ml of gel will be applied to the anterior lip of the cervix. After 1 minute of waiting, a tenaculum will be placed to steady the cervix. The catheter will be introduced into the cervical canal, past the external os and 1-1.5ml of gel will be placed into the canal. After another minute, the IUD will be placed in the standard fashion.</description>
