    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Standard treatment for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a combination of the drugs peg-IFN
      and ribavirin. However, this treatment is not very effective in people with a serious type of
      HCV (HCV genotype 1) and also in people who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      coinfection. Researchers want to add a new drug, boceprevir to see if it can improve
      treatment results in people with both HCV genotype 1 and HIV. Boceprevir used in combination
      with peg-IFN and ribavirin has been recently approved for the treatment of people with HCV
      genotype 1 infection only, and is currently being studied in those with HIV and HCV.

      Objectives:

      - To test boceprevir, peg-IFN, and ribavirin as a treatment for HCV genotype 1 in people with
      HCV monoinfection compared to those with both HIV and HCV infections.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HCV genotype 1 infection, and have not
           received interferon treatment for HCV

        -  Half of the study participants will also have HIV infection.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also
           have blood and urine tests.

        -  Participants will also have heart and liver function tests, and answer questions about
           mood and depression.

        -  Those in the study will receive ribavirin tablets to take twice a day, and peg-IFN to
           inject under the skin weekly.

        -  Two weeks after starting treatment, participants will have blood tests to study the
           treatment.

        -  Four weeks after starting treatment, participants will start taking boceprevir three
           times a day.

        -  Participants will have regular study visits with blood samples and other tests. The
           length of therapy will depend on the level of virus detected in the blood at several
           clinic visits. Those who do not respond well to the medicines at 12 weeks will stop
           treatment. The full length of treatment is 48 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated
      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States, an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. A combination of ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated
      interferon (peg-IFN) is the currently recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection. However,
      this therapy achieves viral clearance in only 19% to 52% of patients infected with HCV
      genotype 1 and 76% to 80% of patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3. Current therapy is
      also associated with a high incidence of adverse events and low cure rates in several
      populations. Novel therapies that do not rely on an interferon backbone will be required to
      enhance cure rates in various populations. Recent data show that adding an HCV serine
      protease inhibitor (such as boceprevir [BOC]) to peg-IFN and RBV results in HCV eradication
      rates of 70% to 80% among HCV-monoinfected subjects. However, whether human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-infected subjects will have similar rates of response to triple combination
      therapy is presently not known. Previous data have suggested that HIV-infected patients with
      chronic HCV infection have much lower eradication rates to peg-IFN and RBV than
      HCV-monoinfected subjects. This study will explore whether HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects have a
      lower response rate to a BOC/peg-IFN/RBV regimen than HCV-monoinfected subjects. Participants
      who have chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 monoinfection (N=50) or coinfection with HIV-1
      (N=50), and who are na(SqrRoot) ve to IFN-based HCV treatment, will receive combination
      therapy with BOC (800 mg three times a day, every 7 to 9 hours, with food), weekly peg-IFN
      alpha-2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week) and twice daily RBV (weight based) for a maximum of 44 weeks,
      after a 4-week lead-in of peg-IFN and RBV. BOC received recent FDA approval for treating HCV
      monoinfection in combination with peg-IFN and RBV, and the approved labeling will be followed
      in this study. The primary endpoint is comparative efficacy in HCV-monoinfected and
      HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects. Secondary endpoints include determination of host predictors for
      therapeutic response, emergence of resistance biomarkers, and early viral kinetics. The
      findings from this study will aid in the understanding of whether HIV infection affects HCV
      antiviral and host responses to combination therapy using BOC/peg-IFN alfa-2b/RBV.

          5. If coinfected, must meet one of the following prior to enrollment:

               1. If on a stable non-NNRTI or non-PI antiretroviral regimen that HAS NOT changed
                  within the past 6 months, must have an HIV-1 VL of less than 400 copies/mL for at
                  least 3 months; or

               2. If on a current antiretroviral regimen that HAS changed within the past 6 months,
                  have an HIV-1 VL of less than 50 copies/mL for at least 3 months; or

               3. Be a long-term nonprogressor as documented in the medica record.

          6. Have histopathologic features consistent with chronic HCV infection at the time of
             enrollment. A liver biopsy within 3 years (36 calendar months) prior to screening may
             be used as the baseline biopsy. Participants can opt out of a liver biopsy if they had
             one more than 3 years prior and have a contraindication, such as receipt of chronic
             anticoagulation therapy. Participants with decompensated liver disease are excluded
             from the study.

          7. Are na(SqrRoot) ve to prior IFN-based treatment for HCV.

          8. Have CD4 cell counts greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm(3).

          9. Willing to have genetic testing.

         10. Not pregnant or breastfeeding. Serum pregnancy test must be negative at screening for
             female participants.

         11. Agree not to become pregnant if a female of childbearing potential while on the study
             and for at least 6 months after stopping RBV. Because of the potential teratogenic
             effects of RBV treatment, subjects and their partners must remain abstinent or use two
             methods of birth control, which may be selected from the following list (oral
             contraceptive concentrations are decreased, and may not be effective when used during
             BOC treatment and, therefore, are not included in this list):

             Surgical sterilization of either partner

             Intrauterine device

             Male or female condoms with or without a spermicide

             Diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge

         12. Male participants who are not documented to be sterile must agree to either abstain
             from intercourse or consistently use a condom while their female partner (if
             applicable) agrees to use one of the appropriate medically accepted methods of birth
             control listed above from the date of screening until 6 months after the last dose of
             RBV.

         13. Be able and willing to either learn to safely inject medication or find another person
             to inject the medication for him/her.

        use of RBV treatment during pregnancy is potentially teratogenic.

        Breastfeeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse effects in
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BOC, PEG, or RBV, breastfeeding
        women are excluded from this study.
