      The study will examine whether a stress reduction intervention reduces the number of seizures
      in people with drug resistant epilepsy. In the proposed randomized controlled, double blind
      trial, the investigators will enroll subjects with frequent seizures, especially those who
      identify stress as a seizure precipitant. There is an observational phase (8-12 weeks) and a
      treatment phase (12 weeks). During the observational phase, subjects will be monitored
      multiple times daily via smart phone devices, in order to identify high risk days for
      seizures. In the treatment phase, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups
      receiving different focused attention practices. These behavioral interventions will be
      administered daily with extra interventions applied on days of higher risk.
