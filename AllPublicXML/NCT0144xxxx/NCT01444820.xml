  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In North America, around a quarter a million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every
      year, and about 31,000 patients will die of their disease each year. Like other western
      countries, the incidence in Canada has increased due to an aging population and prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) screening. This has led to a significant demand on cancer care
      services for these patients. Prostate cancer patient with high risk features are more often
      treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) plus two to three years of hormonal
      manipulation (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist). The most common
      radiation dose treatment for these patients is 74-78 Gy in 37-39 daily fractions of 180-200
      cGy for a treatment length of 7.5 weeks. This fraction size is believed to offer the best
      balance between desired tumour kill and unwanted normal tissue injury. Larger fraction sizes
      of more than 250 cGy (hypofractionation) are usually avoided for curative therapy because
      late reacting normal tissues. However prostate cancer cells have a unique radiobiology
      characteristic that suggests that hypofractionated radiotherapy is more efficient at prostate
      tumour killing than standard fractionation is, and will produce equivalent tumour control
      with a lower total dose and a shorter overall treatment time. Improved target localization
      techniques and conformal radiation therapy technology have allowed for dose escalation and
      hypofractionated radiation delivery in these circumstances with minimal or no increased
      toxicities.

      This trial is designed to determine whether high risk prostate cancer patients can be safely
      treated with a dose escalation hypofractionated radiation therapy in 5 weeks as opposed to
      the usual 7-8 weeks. These patients will be randomized to either the usual 76 Gy in 38
      fractions or 68 Gy in 25 fractions. 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or Intensity Modulated
      Radiotherapy (IMRT) will be used to deliver the required radiation dose. Patients will also
      receive 28 months of androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH agonist). The primary outcome of the
      study is the acute and delayed toxicity and the secondary outcomes include biochemical
      failure, prostate specific mortality rate, bone metastases free survival, the prognostic and
      predictive value of several biological variables: presence of the PTEN deletion; expression
      of FoxP3 gene variants, topoisomerase 2α and cancer testis antigens; expression of X
      chromosome-linked micro-RNAs; presence of TMRSS2-ERG gene fusion and quality of life. It is
      planned to recruit 250 patients to this study.
