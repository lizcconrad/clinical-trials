      This is a study to evaluate an alternative booster for pneumococcal conjugate vaccination
      (PCV) for children at 12 months of age. Currently in the UK, 3 doses of a vaccine called
      Prevenar 13 (PCV-13), which contains 13 pneumococcal serotypes attached to a carrier protein
      called CRM197, are given to children at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. There is some evidence
      that a vaccine called Synflorix (PHiD-CV) may be at least as good as the currently used
      vaccine when used as an alternative vaccine at 12 months of age. Although PHiD-CV contains
      only 10 serotypes, there is evidence that it generates cross-reactive antibodies against two
      of the three additional serotypes included in PCV-13 which might be enough to protect
      children against disease caused by these two serotypes. Furthermore, previous studies have
      shown that PHiD-CV confers protection against a common otitis media pathogen in children
      called nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) by attachment to a carrier protein called Protein D,
      which is derived from NTHi. In addition, the use of a carrier protein, which is not closely
      related to an antigen included in any coadministered or previously administered routine
      vaccine minimises the risk of interference related to it.

      The investigators aim to recruit 168 healthy children at the age of 12 months who have
      already received two doses of PCV-13 according to the UK routine immunisation schedule at 2
      and 4 months of age. Participants will then be randomised to receive a booster dose of either
      PCV-13 or PHiD-CV at 12 months of age.

      Three visits will take place at their parents' home and will involve a blood test followed by
      a dose of PCV-13 or PHiD-CV on visit 1, and a blood test on each of the visits 2 (1 month
      after visit 1) and 3 (1 year after visit 1).
