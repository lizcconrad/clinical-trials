  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often over-expressed, and have been related to
      poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC. EGFR targeting strategies showed clinical anti-tumor
      efficacy in patients with HNSCC. PF-00299804 is a second-generation quinazoline-based
      irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. In preclinical studies, PF-00299804 has much lower IC50
      values than gefitinib in cell lines engineered to express EGFRvIII mutations (1.2 nM versus
      2,700 nM) and produces tumor growth inhibition in gefitinib-resistant xenografts. A phase II
      trial of PF-00299804 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC is currently ongoing and
      preliminary report in ASCO 2010 showed its anti-tumor activity against HNSCC. The
      investigators suggest a phase II trial of pan-HER inhibitor PF-00299804 in patients with
      recurrent or metastatic HNSCC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.

          -  ECOG PS 0-2

          -  Documented progressive disease after platinum-based systemic chemotherapy (either
             cisplatin or carboplatin) with or without cetuximab

          -  At least one bidimensionally measurable disease

          -  Adequate organ function for treatment

          -  Availability of tumor tissue for molecular analysis (archival or rebiopsy tissue)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

          -  Eligibility for local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy)

          -  Previous treatment with small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

          -  More than one systemic chemotherapy

          -  Any major operation or irradiation within 4 weeks of baseline disease assessment

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities which may impair intake or
             absorption of the study drug

          -  CNS metastasis with continuous corticosteroid use within 4 weeks of baseline disease
             assessment

          -  Patients with known interstitial lung disease

          -  Patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease (AMI within 12
             months, Unstable angina within 6 months, NYHA Class III, IV Congestive heart failure
             or left ventricular ejection fraction below local institutional lower limit of normal
             or below 45%, Congenital long QT syndrome, Any significant ventricular arrhythmia, Any
             uncontrolled second or third degree heart block, Uncontrolled hypertension)

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             trial.
