  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many researchers suspect that individuals with Tourette Syndrome (TS) may have a poor
      cognitive ability (i.e., response inhibition; RI) that is essential to inhibit inappropriate
      response such as vocal or motor tics. The investigators aim to test whether a
      well-established behavior therapy for TS can be improved by increasing the individual's RI
      capabilities. To this end, 20 children will be randomly assigned to behavior therapy with
      computer-based RI training or behavior therapy with placebo computer-based cognitive
      training. The investigators will test the hypothesis that computer-based RI training can be a
      useful addition to the well-established behavior therapy to enhance its therapeutic effect.

      The current research seeks to examine the feasibility of using a computer-based RI training
      program as an adjunctive intervention for the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics
      (CBIT). Our central hypothesis is that cognitive training designed to enhance RI will
      potentiate treatment outcomes of CBIT. To this end, the investigators will conduct a two-arm
      placebo-controlled double-blind trial, in which 20 children with TS will be randomly assigned
      to CBIT with computerized RI training (CBIT+RIT; n=10) or CBIT with placebo computer training
      (CBIT +PLT; n=10). CBIT consists of eight weekly sessions that present awareness training,
      competing response training, relaxation training and functional contingency management in a
      manualized format. The adjunctive computer training (RIT or PLT) will be delivered during the
      first 4 weeks of CBIT/HRT (i.e. 8 twice-weekly 40-min sessions). Tic symptoms and RI
      capabilities will be assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 1 month
      follow-up. This project is expected to increase our understanding about the nature of
      response inhibition deficits in TS and generate knowledge that will guide the development of
      effective cognitive interventions for TS.

    <description>CBIT is an 8 session treatment protocol held over 10 weeks. In CBIT, core components are implemented across the various therapy sessions. These core components include habit reversal training (HRT), functional assessment/function-based interventions, and a behavioral reward program for the child. Each core component is briefly described below. HRT/CBIT involves three components, awareness training, competing response training, and social support training (Woods, Twohig, Roloff, &amp; Flessner, 2003). For this condition, CBIT will be combined with adjunctive computerized response inhibition training, which will be delivered over the first 4 weeks of the CBIT treatment.</description>

    <description>In this condition, participants receive the same package of CBIT treatment, which consists of awareness training, competing response training, and social support training (Woods, Twohig, Roloff, &amp; Flessner, 2003). Additionally, the standard CBIT treatment is combined with computer-based placebo cognitive training that is irrelevant to the target cognitive ability (i.e., response inhibition). During the first 4 weeks of the CBIT treatment, participants will receive 8 sessions of placebo cognitive training.</description>
