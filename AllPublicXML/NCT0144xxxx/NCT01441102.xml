      Background: Many people with diabetes have macular edema (swelling) at the back of the eye.
      Macular edema can cause loss of vision. Studies suggest that inflammation may be involved in
      the swelling. A drug called dextromethorphan may help prevent the inflammation and the
      swelling. Dextromethorphan is approved for use as a cough medicine, but it has not been
      studied to see if it can help in diabetic macular edema.

      Objectives: To see if dextromethorphan can help treat diabetic macular edema.

      Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have diabetic macular edema in at least
      one eye.

      Design:

        -  This study lasts 2 years, and will require at least 14 visits to the National Eye
           Institute outpatient clinic. Study visits will be every month for the first 2 months and
           then every other month. Each visit will take about 2 to 4 hours.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, eye exam, and blood
           tests. One eye with macular edema will be chosen as the study eye for testing.

        -  Participants will take dextromethorphan twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years.
           A study diary will help keep track of the date, time, and number of pills taken.

        -  Participants will have study visits once a month for the first 2 months and then every
           other month for the rest of the study. Each study visit will involve eye exams and blood
           and urine tests.

        -  Four months after starting the study medication, participants may have laser surgery or
           other treatments for the macular edema, if it is needed.

      Objective:

      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. A
      frequent manifestation of DR is diabetic macular edema (DME) for which the only proven
      treatment is laser photocoagulation. In the retina, microglia are capable of migrating
      through the retina to sites of inflammation to associate closely with neurons and the
      vasculature, and are key cellular players in the mediation of processes of chronic
      inflammation implicated in DME. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising cellular
      target for forms of therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes found in DR. The
      objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of dextromethorphan as a
      microglia inhibitor in participants with DME.

      Study Population:

      Eligibility criteria include presence of diabetic retinopathy with retinal thickening due to
      diabetic macular edema within 3000 μm of the center of the macula as measured by optical
      coherence tomography (OCT), and visual acuity better than 20/200 in the study eye.

      Design:

      Five participants will be initially enrolled in this unmasked pilot study. However, up to an
      additional three participants may be enrolled to account for participants who withdraw from
      the study prior to receipt of six months of study treatment. Participants will take an oral
      dose of 60 mg of dextromethorphan twice daily for 24 months. During each visit, participants
      will have their visual acuity measured and will undergo OCT testing to measure retinal
      thickness. Beginning at the Month 4 visit, participants will be assessed for worsening
      disease defined as loss of ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters of
      vision compared to baseline or a ≥ 50% increase in total central retinal thickness as
      measured by OCT. Individual participants deemed to have worsening disease may stay on the
      study and continue to receive study medication, but will be allowed to receive focal laser
      therapy for any amenable leaking microaneurysms and/or anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections (such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab) at the discretion
      of the treating physician. Additionally, beginning at the Month 6 visit, participants will be
      eligible for treatment, with either focal laser or anti-VEGF injections if they have
      center-involving macular edema.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome is the change in retinal thickness measured by OCT at 6 months compared
      to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the change in retinal thickness as measured by OCT at
      12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at
      6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, change in mean macular sensitivity as measured
      by microperimetry at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, as well as changes in
      fluid leakage in the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein angiography at 6, 12, 18 and 24
      months compared to baseline. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of systemic and
      ocular toxicities, and adverse events.

        Study Eye Exclusion Criteria

          1. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

             An eye should not be considered eligible if:

               -  The macular edema is considered to be related to cataract extraction; or

               -  Clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., a
                  taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of the
                  macular edema.

          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, non-retinal condition).

          3. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy (DR) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during
             the course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory
             disease, neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          5. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within four months prior to study
             entry.

          6. History of prior pars plana vitrectomy within six months prior to study entry.

          7. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.

          8. History of Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) capsulotomy performed within two months
             prior to study entry.

          9. History of treatment within three months prior to enrollment with any drug that has
             not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry, such as intravitreal or
             periocular steroids or intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.

        Choice of Study Eye in Cases of Bilateral Disease

        If both eyes of a participant meet the criteria described above, the following will be used
        to determine the study eye:

          1. If one eye is treatment-naïve and the other is not, the treatment-naïve eye will be
             chosen as the study eye.

          2. If both eyes are treatment-naïve, the eye with the better visual acuity will be chosen
             as the study eye.

          3. If both eyes are treatment-naïve and are equivalent, the choice of study eye will be
             determined at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.

          4. If both eyes have been previously treated, the choice of study eye will be determined
             at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.

        <description>Retinal thickness was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), a non-invasive imaging technique that uses long-wavelength light to capture micrometer-resolution cross-sectional images from biological tissue. The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria. The eye not chosen as the study eye is referred to as the &quot;fellow eye.&quot;</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Retinal Thickness in the Study Eye at 24 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Retinal thickness was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), a non-invasive imaging technique that uses long-wavelength light to capture micrometer-resolution cross-sectional images from biological tissue. Changes in OCT will be calculated using the ETDRS grid. Attention will be directed to changes in retinal thickness as measured by OCT in each of the 9 subfields of the grid.</description>
