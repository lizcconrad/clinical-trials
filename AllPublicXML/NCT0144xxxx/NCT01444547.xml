      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line chemotherapy
      with cisplatin and paclitaxel in esophageal cancer

    <textblock>
      Open label single arm phase II study of cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent
      or metastatic esophageal cancer. 92 Patients will be enrolled in this local trial. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate of the treatment.Schedule
      for this study is as follows: paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 will be administered as an intravenous
      infusion over 3 hour on Days 1, followed by cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Days 2. This study will
      also include the investigation of ERCC1 expression in order to assess determinants of
      efficacy of the treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel in the study population.
