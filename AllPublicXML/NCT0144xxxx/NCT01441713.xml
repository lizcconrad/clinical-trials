  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced prostate cancer usually receive some kind of pharmaceutical castration
      or undergo surgical castration. At the investigators department the pharmaceutical treatment
      is most often given with a 3 month interval.

      Over the last few years new drugs, which allow for lees frequent treatment, have been
      developed. The purpose of this study is to assess how the treatment affects patients and if
      our current patients would prefer to receive treatment at different intervals than they do at
      the present time. At the same time the investigators will assess how surgical treatment
      affects our patients. This will be assessed by patient questionnaires administered at our
      clinic.
