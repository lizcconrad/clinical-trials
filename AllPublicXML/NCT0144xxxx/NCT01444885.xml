      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Pletaal (Cilostazol)
      in comparison with placebo for 4 weeks in vasospastic angina patients who have an
      insufficient response to Amlodipine (Calcium channel blocker).

      A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel group, Therapeutic
      exploratory Study.

      The subject who has at least an episode of chest pain weekly despite Amlodipine 5mg once a
      day (qd) taking during 2 weeks will have treatment of Pletaal (Cilostazol) or Placebo for 4
      weeks. Pletaal (Cilostazol) is taken 100mg oral tablets two times a day (bid) during 2 weeks
      after dosing of Pletaal (Cilostazol) 50mg oral tablets bid during 2 weeks. Placebo of Pletaal
      (Cilostazol) is used as the control medication.
