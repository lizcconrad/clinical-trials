      Background.

      Uremic pruritus is still a common phenomenon in patients with end-stage renal failure. It is
      regarded as one of the most bothersome symptoms in patients on chronic dialysis.

      The pathogenesis of uremic itch remains unclear. Several theories have been proposed like
      dryness of the skin, imbalance in divalent ions, peripheral neuropathy and others.

      Many treatment modalities have been tried to reduce uremic pruritus, however , the majority
      of them produced only temporary improvement. Therefore , every new therapeutic option for
      uremic pruritus is desirable.

      This study will undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a cream which included olive oil and
      omega-3 fatty acids.

      Olive Omega-3 is an efficient product that soothes itchiness of cracked and very dry skin.

      The product is unique and based on patented technology developed by the Technion Research and
      Development Foundation in Haifa.

      Olive Omega-3 is an ointment composed of all natural ingredients. The main active ingredients
      are extra virgin olive oil , fish oil and vitamin C. The oils provides the skin with fatty
      acids that are vital for its proper functioning and help in the skin recovery. Sugar cane
      extract improves the skin's flexibility by removing dead cells and enhancing water retention
      in the upper layer of the skin.

      When applied on clean skin , the product is quickly absorbed , producing a sensation of
      relief within a short time period. Treatment can be repeated as often as required with no
      limitations and its use is not contraindicative of any other medical treatment.

      Patients and Methods.

      About 20 patients on chronic hemodialysis suffering from uremic pruritus will be include in
      the study.

      All patients will undergo dermatologic examination. All patients will be score by intensity
      of itching according to 3-point scale , as follows:

        1. - patches of fine , powdery scales

        2. - moderate scaling with beginning cracks

        3. - intense scaling , moderate cracks The patients all applied Olive Omega-3 ointment for
           50% of body and Vaseline ointment for the second one. The treatment will repeated twice
           daily for two weeks.

      At the end of 2 weeks application global tolerance will evaluate using the following 3-point
      scale:

        1. very good

        2. good

        3. poor

      At the same time global agreement of the patients will evaluate according to the following
      scale :

        1. - very satisfactory

        2. - satisfactory 3- poorly satisfactory.

      Statistical analysis will be performed by use of Wilcoxon test .
