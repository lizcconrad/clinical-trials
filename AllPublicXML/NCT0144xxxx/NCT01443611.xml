  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The actual recommendations for infants aged 3 to 12 months presented with first episode of
      Febrile Convulsions highly recommend performing lumbar puncture in order to rule out
      Bacterial Meningitis. On the other hand, recent studies in the era of anti Pneumococcal
      vaccination arise the question if in the presence of a normal physical examination those
      recommendations are still relevant. The purpose of this study is to summarized
      retrospectively the clinical records of all the infants admitted to the pediatric wards in
      the ten years period since 2000 to 2010 in order to record the incidence of Bacterial
      Meningitis among infants admitted with the First episode of Febrile Convulsions.

      Demographic data, including ethnic origin, age an gender will be recorded. The type of
      Convulsions (Simple or Complex), duration, and time since the fever was noticed will be also
      recorded. Another data that will be summarized included: previous antibiotic treatment,
      physical examination with special emphasis on neurological examination and meningeal signs,
      routine laboratory analysis including blood count and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results and
      the final diagnosis including the cause of fever.
