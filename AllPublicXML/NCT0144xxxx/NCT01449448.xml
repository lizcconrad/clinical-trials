  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection with corticosteroid is one of the most common non-operative interventions in the
      treatment of subacromial impingement; however, its use is limited by its potential side
      effects (e.g. tendon rupture, subcutaneous atrophy, articular cartilage changes). The
      objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of subacromial injection of triamcinolone
      compared to injection of ketorolac. Thirty-two patients diagnosed with external shoulder
      impingement syndrome were included in this double-blinded randomized controlled clinical
      trial. Each patient was randomized into the Steroid group or NSAID group.

      After a single injection into the subacromial space, the patients were instructed to perform
      home physical therapy and follow-up in four weeks. Each patient was evaluated in terms of arc
      of motion, Visual Analog Scale and the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale.

      The outcome measures were taken at the preinjection state, immediately post injection, and at
      4 weeks follow-up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Shoulder pain characteristic of subacromial impingement syndrome with passive and/or
             active abduction in the 60-120 arc of motion (positive impingement sign)

          2. Diagnosis of subacromial bursitis based on tenderness to palpation anterior/lateral to
             the acromion. Pain may be exacerbated with the shoulder held in internal rotation
             (positive Hawkins test)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 years

          2. Symptoms less than one month

          3. Previous shoulder injections within the past 3 months

          4. Evidence of os-acromiale or other confounding shoulder pathology on plain radiographs

          5. Evidence of shoulder osteoarthritis

          6. Full thickness rotator cuff tear evidenced by MRI, cuff weakness after lidocaine
             injection, or positive drop-arm sign

          7. Systemic inflammatory condition

          8. Pending litigation or work-related claims related to the shoulder

          9. Previous shoulder surgery on the affected shoulder

         10. Evidence of local infection

         11. Evidence of adhesive capsulitis

         12. Previous history of gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding disorders

         13. Evidence of shoulder instability
