    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a drug called sirolimus is safe to give to people with
      geographic atrophy (GA) and if it can help preserve vision in patients. GA is an advanced
      form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD affects the macula, the central part
      of the retina at the back of the eye needed for sharp, clear vision. There are two types of
      AMD, wet and dry. In dry AMD, cells in the macula die.

      GA may be partially caused by inflammation. Sirolimus helps prevent inflammation and
      therefore may help people with GA. Researchers want to see whether sirolimus can help prevent
      vision loss in people with GA.

      People at least 56 years of age who have GA related to AMD in both eyes may be eligible for
      this study.

      This study requires at least 8 visits to the National Eye Institute over 1 year. Study visits
      will be every 2 months for 1 year.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also
           have blood and urine tests, and eye exams. One eye will be selected as the study eye to
           receive the sirolimus injections.

        -  Participants will have a sirolimus injection into the study eye at the first visit and
           every 2 months thereafter unless contraindicated. There will be a follow-up eye exam 1
           month after the first injection.

      Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people
      over age 65 in the United States, is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal
      degeneration occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to
      impairment of central visual acuity. AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which involves
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar. This is
      often referred to as the neovascular or wet form. A second form, the subject of this study,
      is termed dry or atrophic macular degeneration and involves a constellation of clinical
      features that can include drusen, pigment clumping and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
      dropout and geographic atrophy (GA). GA can begin as a thinning of the RPE with involvement
      of the underlying choriocapillaris and subsequently lead to an atrophic change in the macula.
      Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of GA. Sirolimus inhibits the production,
      signaling and activity of many inflammatory factors relevant to the development of GA.
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the safety and possible efficacy of
      serial sirolimus intravitreal injections in participants with bilateral GA.

      Study Population: Six participants with bilateral GA associated with AMD will be enrolled.
      Initially, 10 participants with bilateral GA associated with AMD were to be enrolled.
      However, only six will be enrolled, as sirolimus intravitreal injections will no longer be
      administered to participants.

      Design: In this single-center, prospective, controlled, unmasked, Phase I/II study, one eye
      of eligible participants was initially randomized to investigational product (intravitreal
      sirolimus) while the fellow eye was observed. Participants initially received a 20 μL (440
      μg) intravitreal injection sirolimus in the study eye at baseline and every two months
      thereafter unless contraindicated. As of September 2012, sirolimus intravitreal injections
      were no longer administered to participants. Both the study and fellow eyes will be observed
      every two months until the study terminates. The study will not terminate until all
      participants have been followed through Month 12.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA based on masked
      grading by an external Reading Center of fundus photographs in the study eye and fellow eye
      at Month 12 compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes will include changes in best-corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA), changes in drusen area based on masked digital grading of fundus
      photography, absolute and relative changes in area of GA measured using fundus photography
      and autofluorescence imaging, and development of exudative AMD measured using optical
      coherence tomography (OCT). Safety outcomes will include the number and severity of adverse
      events (AEs). Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated by changes in visual acuity, ocular
      surface changes, intraocular inflammation and any other ocular changes not consistent with
      the natural progression of GA.

    <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20. One eye (the study eye) was initially randomized to receive intravitreal sirolimus and the fellow eye was observed as the control.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. 56 or older

          2. Must understand and sign the protocol's informed consent document

          3. Must have at least ½ disc area (approximately 1 mm^2) of GA compatible with AMD
             present in each eye

             GA is defined as one or more well-defined and often circular patches of partial or
             complete depigmentation of the RPE, typically with exposure of underlying choroidal
             blood vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears to be preserved and large choroidal
             vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE partial depigmentation may be classified
             as early GA. The GA in each eye must be able to be photographed in their entirety, and
             it must not be contiguous with any areas of peripapillary atrophy, which can
             complicate area measurements

          4. Must have at least one large druse (greater than or equal to 125 μm) in each eye

          5. Must not have any evidence or history of exudative disease related to AMD in either
             eye as determined by a recent fluorescein angiogram performed within 4 months of study
             enrollment

          6. Must have a steady fixation in both eyes in the foveal or parafoveal area and media
             clear enough for good quality photographs

          7. Must have visual acuity of 20/400 or better in each eye

             completely abstinent from intercourse, or agree to practice two acceptable methods of
             contraception throughout the course of the study and four months after their last
             study injection. Acceptable methods of contraception include:

               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal
                  patch or vaginal ring),

               -  intrauterine device,

               -  barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or

               -  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

          4. Has any of the following: a) a history of macular laser, b) a history of photodynamic
             therapy (PDT), c) received an intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial
             growth factor (VEGF) agent for wet/exudative AMD at any point, or d) received an
             intravitreal injection of any other agent (not an anti-VEGF agent) within four months
             prior to study enrollment

             Participants currently taking or who have previously taken AREDS vitamin
             supplementation are not excluded.

          5. Has had a vitrectomy

          6. Expected to need ocular surgery during the course of the trial

        <title>Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20. One eye (the study eye) was initially randomized to receive intravitreal sirolimus and the fellow eye was observed as the control.</description>

          <title>Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Fellow Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20. One eye (the study eye) was initially randomized to receive intravitreal sirolimus and the fellow eye was observed as the control.</description>

        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for color stereoscopic fundus images by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).
This outcome measure was calculated by subtracting the GA value for the study eye at baseline from the GA value for the study eye at Month 12.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Area of GA, as Measured by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) Imaging Using a Modified Fundus Camera (mFC), in the Study Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline.</title>
        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for FAF images obtained with a mFC by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).
This outcome measure was calculated by subtracting the GA value for the study eye at baseline from the GA value for the study eye at Month 12.</description>

        <title>Relative Change in Area of GA, as Measured by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) Imaging Using a Modified Fundus Camera (mFC), in the Study Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline.</title>
        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for FAF images obtained with a mFC by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).
This outcome measure was calculated by dividing the absolute change in the total area of GA in the study eye at 12 months by the baseline value.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT). Although 6 participants were enrolled, only 5 were followed for 12 months.</population>
