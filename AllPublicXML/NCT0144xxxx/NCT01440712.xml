  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the water-soluble contrast (gastrografin)
      is more effective in the treatment of postoperative ileus than the conventional one.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery, defined as the
             presence from the third postoperative day, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting with
             or without abdominal pain or discomfort by dilation of bowel loops, confirmed
             radiology of the abdomen, and which are: Age &gt; 18 years Patients undergoing laparotomy
             or laparoscopy for the following variants of colorectal disease with or without stoma:

               1. Neoplasia.

               2. Inflammatory disease.

               3. Diverticular disease. Patients who have been treated with standard PCA as
                  postoperative analgesia. Signed informed consent. Undergoing elective or
                  scheduled

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's refusal to sign informed consent

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast agents (it´s the only contraindication to oral
             Gastrografin) Presence of other problems that justify the etiology of postoperative
             ileus:

               1. Anastomotic leakages.

               2. Mesenteric vascular disease.

               3. Incarcerated hernias.

               4. Intra-abdominal abscesses or collections.

               5. Metabolic or electrolyte disturbances. If during the course of the study one of
                  the reasons previously cited as the etiology of postoperative ileus is present,
                  the patient shall also be excluded. Also excluded patients undergoing emergency
                  surgery.
