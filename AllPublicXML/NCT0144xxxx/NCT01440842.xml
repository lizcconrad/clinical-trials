      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a
      computer-based control algorithm to control glucose levels in adults in intensive care unit,
      in comparison to standard care.

      This will be a single centre, open-label, randomised, parallel design, feasibility study
      conducted at Neurosciences Critical Care Unit (NCCU), Addenbrooke's hospital, Cambridge, UK.
      Study will aim for 24 adult subjects (12 participants in each arm of the trial) and study
      will last for up to 49 hours in each subject. Subjects will have a commercially available
      Conformité Européenne(CE) marked subcutaneous glucose sensor inserted at the start of the
      study. Glucose data from the sensor will be transmitted to a small bedside tablet computer,
      containing the algorithm which will determine insulin infusion rates aimed at maintaining
      glucose level between 6.0 - 8.0 mmol/L. The advice from the algorithm will be sent to the
      infusion pump via USB cable and insulin will be delivered intravenously. The system will also
      deliver intravenous glucose via a second infusion pump at times of low glucose levels.
      Samples for reference glucose values will be obtained either from an arterial line or central
      venous cannula and will be analysed using standard blood gas analyser in real time. Subjects
      randomised to standard care will receive intravenous insulin based on current treatment
      guidelines at the Neurosciences critical care unit (NCCU), Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge,
      UK.

      The primary outcome is time spent in target glucose range between 6.0 to 8.0 mmol/L as
      recorded by reference glucose. Secondary outcomes are the time spent with glucose levels
      above and below target, as recorded by reference glucose, and sensor accuracy. Safety
      includes evaluation of significant hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and other adverse events.

    <description>Definition of Reference glucose = Blood Glucose level measured by arterial blood gas analyzer. This is reported in mmol/L
During the study subjects will have the reference glucose measured every 1 hour and this is used for the calculation of mean (mmol/L) and standard deviation which will reflect the efficasy of closed loop insulin delivery.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 49 hours in each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>For a given subcutaneous glucose sensor value, difference between the sensor and the reference glucose will be calculated. Example - Reference glucose 10 mmol/L and sensor glucose 12 mmol/L, therefore absolute difference will be 2 mmol/L. Mean and median of these deviations will be reported in mmol/L. The term relative implies that data has been converted to a percentage deviation from reference glucose.</description>
