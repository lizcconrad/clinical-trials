    <textblock>
      Acellular porcine cornea is a valid substitution for human cornea because of its similar
      biological structure, corneal superficial curvature and good histocompatibility toward human.
      Facing the lack of human cornea donor, it is hypothesised that using acellular lamellar
      porcine cornea as an alternative of lamellar human cornea to treat infectious corneal ulcer.

      Acellular porcine cornea eligibility criteria:

        1. fresh porcine cornea,

        2. porcine cornea keeping transparent without scar, neovascularization or corneal ulcer,

        3. porcine cornea keeping integrative corneal epithelium and endothelium,

        4. acellular porcine cornea keeping transparent.

Sub-epithelial nerve plex is in the depth between 35um to 65um shaping like white thin line with branches in vivo confocal microscopy.
Sromal nerve is in the stromal layer(about 70um to 500um) shaping like white thick trunk with branches in vivo confocal microscopy.
Stromal keratocytes is in the stromal layer like white rod-shape in vivo confocal microscopy.</description>
