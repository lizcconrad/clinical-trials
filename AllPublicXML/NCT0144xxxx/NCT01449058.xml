  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose-finding, phase Ib study to estimate the maximum
      tolerated dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDE(s)) for the orally
      administered combination of BYL719 and MEK162. This combination will be explored in adult
      patients with advanced CRC, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or
      other advanced solid tumors and in adult patients with AML or high risk and very high risk
      MDS, with documented RAS or BRAF mutations. Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian
      logistic regression model with overdose control. At MTD or RDE, four expansion arms will be
      opened in order to further assess the safety and preliminary activity of the combination of
      BYL719 and MEK162 in specific patient populations.

    <measure>Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>during the first cycle (28 days) of treatment with BYL719 and MEK162</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 unless otherwise specified. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as at least possibly related to the study medication, occurs â‰¤ 28 days following the first dose of BYL719 and MEK162 (Cycle 1), and meets any of the protocol-specified DLT criteria.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from Cycle 1 Day 1 until treatment discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs and SAEs will be collected in accordance with the protocol and assessed for relatedness to study drug combination.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 8 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 8 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression (TTP) is the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer. If a patient has not had an event, time to progression is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 8 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time versus plasma concentration profiles of BYL719 and MEK162</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during the first cycle of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Blood concentrations of MEK162 and its metabolite (AR00426032) and BYL719 will be assessed during the first cycle of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of baseline mutation or amplification status (PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) and clinical anti-tumor activity outcome</measure>

    <measure>Clinical benefit rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 4 weeks for 3 months and every 3 months for 6 months followed by every 6 months thereafter until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients with complete remission, complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, partial remission, minor response or stable disease for &gt; 15 weeks</description>
