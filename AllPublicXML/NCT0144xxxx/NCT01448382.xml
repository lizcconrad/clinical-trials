      1. Primary Scientific Objective

             -  Collect human clinical data to sustain the development of blood detection sensor
                and optimize its algorithm and parameters

             -  Preliminary evaluation of blood detection performances in human.

        2. Secondary Scientific Objective

             -  Assessment of blood detection sensor ability to identify the anatomical location
                (i.e. Stomach, SB or Colon)

             -  Evaluation of capsule transit characteristics in the GI tract

             -  Evaluation of BBC capsule safety

      Study Hypothesis:

      It is estimated that by implementing a spectrophotometer technology in capsule and utilizing
      the unique characteristics of light absorption by blood in specific spectrum, the capsule
      will be able to automatically detect blood in the GI tract with high accuracy. As such, the
      system may be an add-on to video capsules to provide efficient and quick detection of blood
      presence (for example in OGBI patients) or as stand alone low cost capsule (without video)
      which could serve as a tool similar to standard FOBT.

      This study is designed to support the development of a novel blood sensing detector embedded
      in a PillCam® capsule and to provide initial evaluation of its performance in humans. The
      device is named Blood Sensing Capsule (BSC), and is based on the Given PillCam® Platform with
      a modified capsule.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  The subject was referred to Gastroscopy for at least one of the following reasons:

               1. History of acute, overt UGI hemorrhage, defined as hematemesis (fresh blood or
                  coffee grounds) and/or melena within the 48 hours prior to patient presentation

               2. Subject has ongoing overt gastrointestinal bleeding with hematochezia or melena

               3. Subject has Iron Deficiency Anemia ,FOBT(+) and negative colonoscopy examination

               4. Other known or suspected cause of acute upper GI bleeding

          -  Subject agrees to sign the Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has Dysphagia, odynophagia, known swallowing disorder or history of Zencker's
