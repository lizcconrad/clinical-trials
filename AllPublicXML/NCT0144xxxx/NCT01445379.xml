      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab-an experimental cancer
      treatment drug used to boost immune response-in children, adolescents, and young adults.
      Ipilimumab may allow immune cells to react to and destroy abnormal cells in the body, and has
      been tested in adults for a variety of cancers and has shown responses in some research
      studies. Because ipilimumab has not been tested in children, adolescents, or young adults, it
      is considered an experimental drug. The purposes of this research study are to determine the
      highest safe dose of ipilimumab for children, adolescents, and young adults with solid tumor
      cancers; examine its effectiveness and possible side effects; and better understand how the
      body and the immune system process it over time.

      Candidates must be between 2 and 21 years of age and must have solid malignant tumors that
      have been resistant to standard therapy. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history,
      a clinical examination, and computerized scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Participants must have completed their last dose of chemotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, or
      antibody or investigational therapy at least four weeks prior to enrollment.

      During the study, participants will receive an intravenous dose of ipilimumab once every
      three weeks. The infusion of ipilimumab will last 90 minutes, and the participant s vital
      signs will be monitored while the medicine is infusing and several times in the first 24
      hours after the first dose (requiring a hospital stay during that time). If the participant
      is able to tolerate the first dose of ipilimumab, further doses (called cycles ) may be
      received on an outpatient basis. Blood and urine tests will be given on a regular basis
      during these cycles. After four cycles, participants whose tumors do not grow and who do not
      have unacceptable side effects will continue to receive ipilimumab every three months to
      maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study.

      Background:

      Solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children. Despite
      intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors have unsatisfactory
      survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes.

      Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of biologic approaches to
      heighten antitumor immunity in order to improve the effectiveness of immune based therapy.
      Both directly activating immune based therapies such as cytokines and tumor vaccines as well
      as therapies which disrupt negative counterregulatory signals such as those mediated by
      CTLA-4:B7 may enhance existent antitumor immune responses.

      Antibodies directed against CTLA-4 potently augment immune responses in animal models and
      anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of preclinical tumor
      models.

      Phase I and phase II studies using ipilimumab have been performed in adults with a variety of
      tumor types. Clinical responses have been observed in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and
      prostate cancer. No trials have yet been performed to evaluate ipilimumab in children with
      malignancy.

      Objectives:

      To determine the tolerance and toxicity profile of ipilimumab at a range of doses up to, but
      not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults, in patients less than or equal to 21
      years of age with refractory solid tumors.

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab administered intravenously in patients less than
      or equal to 21 years of age with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must be 1-21 years of age at the time of enrollment with solid malignant tumors
      refractory to standard therapy.

      Design:

      A Phase I dose finding study with 4 planned dose levels.

      Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level with an expanded cohort of 12 at the
      highest or maximum torlerated dose with intent to include 6 patients &lt; 12 years.

      Re-induction with 4 infusions of ipilimumab at the assigned dose followed by another
      maintenance phase is possible for subjects who have progressed during maintenance therapy.

             must have elapsed since transplant.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects (to a grade 1 or less) of all
             prior therapy prior to enrollment, with the exception of the following:

               -  Hematological toxicity: recovery to levels required below

               -  Low electrolyte levels (Such individuals should receive appropriate
                  supplementation)

               -  For patients on anticoagulant therapy or with pre-existing coagulation
                  abnormalities, PT, PTT must return to baseline.

               -  Liver function tests must resolve to values required below

               -  Grade 3 hypoalbuminemia

               -  Alopecia

        greater than or equal to 50 and children less than 10 years old must have a Lansky score of
        greater than 50. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis or weakness, but who
        are up in a wheelchair will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating the
        performance score.

        HEMATOLOGIC FUNCTION: Patients must have adequate bone marrow function, defined as a
        peripheral absolute granulocyte count of greater than or equal to 1000/microL, hemoglobin
        greater than or equal to 8 gm/dl, and a platelet count greater than or equal to

        equal to 2.5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN). Normal total bilirubin.

        RENAL FUNCTION: Patients must have normal age-adjusted serum creatinine (see table below)
        OR a creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 70 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

          -  For children whose age is greater than 15, 1.5 mg/dL

        INFECTIOUS DISEASE:

        -A patient with viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be
        excluded from trial to limit confounding variables in the assessment of the potential
        hepatic toxicity of ipilimumab and uncertain impact of ipilimumab administration on viral
        replication. Serology will not be required unless infection is clinically suspected. A
        positive hepatitis B titer does not exclude a patient if immunization has been performed
        and if there is no history of disease.

        INFORMED CONSENT: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18
        years old) must sign a document of informed consent (Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI
        screening protocol for NIH patients) prior to performing studies to determine patient
        eligibility. After confirmation of eligibility, all patients or their legal guardians must
        voluntarily sign the IRB approved protocol specific informed consent to document their
        understanding of the investigational nature, the risks of this study and their willingness
        to receive the therapy and undergo the research studies involved including pharmacokinetic
        studies. The consent must be signed before any protocol related studies are performed (This
        does not include routine laboratory tests or imaging studies required to establish
        eligibility). When appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in all discussions in
        order to obtain verbal assent.

        DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY (DPA): Patients who are greater than or equal to 18 years of age
        will be offered the opportunity to assign a DPA so that another person can make decisions
        about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired.

        BIRTH CONTROL: Patients of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use
        a medically acceptable form of birth control which includes abstinence, while they are
        being treated on this study and for 60 days following the last dose. Females of
        childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to
        initiation of study therapy and prior to each additional dose of ipilimumab.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Primary brain tumors

          -  Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections or organ
             dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would
