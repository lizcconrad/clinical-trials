        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          -  Males or females aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) and with a weight of at least 50 kg
             and a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and negative serum
             pregnancy test on admission to the unit, must not be lactating, and must be using an
             acceptable method of contraception for at least 1 month before dosing

          -  Female volunteers of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who have
             had a menstrual period within 1 year) must be using appropriate birth control (defined
             as a method which results in a low failure rate, ie, less than 1% per year

          -  Oral contraceptive and hormone replacement medications are allowed in this study if
             used together with a barrier contraceptive method.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disease or any other condition
             known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs
             (except for cholecystectomy)

          -  Glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min (to be estimated at screening only)

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of investigational product (IP)

          -  History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as
             judged by the Investigator (eg, seasonal allergies) or history of hypersensitivity to
             drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to saxagliptin or metformin
