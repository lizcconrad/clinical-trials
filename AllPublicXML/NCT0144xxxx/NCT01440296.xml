  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN) is a pan-canadian imaging network funded
      through grants from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Canadian Institutes
      of Health Research (CIHR). This unique research network is focused on the pathobiology of
      atherosclerotic disease as it pertains to the coronary and carotid circulations. The CAIN
      research program involves the creation of a unique national network focused on in vivo
      imaging of vessel wall disease, combined with imaging of occult end-organ disease as well as
      the acquisition of clinical and pathological end points. CAIN enables unprecedented
      cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical studies of patients with atherosclerotic disease in
      coronary or carotid vascular beds, and has established an international resource for studying
      the natural history, progression, regression and novel therapeutic interventions aimed at
      atherosclerosis.

      The primary outcome of this study is to accurately characterise carotid plaque morphology in
      non-surgical patients with mild to severe (30-95%) carotid disease. The investigators will
      also assess evidence of ischaemic brain disease. Patients will undergo MRI scanning of the
      brain and carotid and US scanning of the carotid at baseline and thereafter at 1 and 2 years
      or sooner if presenting clinically in order to monitor the natural history of carotid
      atherosclerosis and its effect on end-organ brain disease.

      Patients will consent to baseline scanning and follow up at 1 and 2 years, and databasing of
      clinical and imaging data. After each imaging session images will be processed, stored
      locally and also sent to a central repository. 500 patients will be recruited over a 2 year
      period in anticipation of study completion within 4 years.
