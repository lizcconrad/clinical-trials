    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a Psychodynamic Motivation and
      Training Program (PMT) for the improvement of physical fitness in patients with stable
      coronary heart disease as compared to advice in exercise training or treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonpharmacological secondary prevention of coronary heart disease is considered to be a safe
      and effective measure for reducing mortality substantially. Major targets are the improvement
      of physical activity and dietary habits, smoking cessation and stress reduction. Despite the
      effectiveness of life style changes, the compliance rate of patients is very low. To improve
      compliance with life style change programs psychotherapeutic interventions appear to have
      significant potential. Against this background our study aims to examine the effectiveness of
      a Psychodynamic Motivation and Training Program (PMT) in addition to one session of advice in
      exercise training based on the results of spiroergometry (+EX) and usual cardiological care
      (TAU). PMT will be compared with +Ex and TAU. N = 90 patients with stable coronary artery
      disease class, low physical activity, class I to III angina pectoris will be randomly
      assigned to the three treatment conditions. The Primary efficacy endpoint is change in the
      anaerobic threshold from baseline to 6 month follow-up. The results of the study will 1) help
      to determine the effectiveness of a psychodynamic life style change programs for the
      secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and 2) will help to identify measures for
      designing specifically tailored interventions to improve compliance with cardiovascular
      prevention.

    <description>The Psychodynamic Motivation and Training Program (PMT) is a psychodynamic stepped care approach. Depending on the individual needs PMT consists of 3 to 8 sessions of individual psychodynamic psychotherapy. If appropriate session 4 - 8 may be conducted by a nurse. PMT targets the mental and external barriers to improve physical activity by focusing on affects, interpersonal relations and maladaptive self- and other representations. PMT will be offered in addition to +Ex.</description>
