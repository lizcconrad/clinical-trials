      This study is a regulatory post marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received Zevalin for relapsed or
      refractory, CD20+, low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Mantle cell lymphoma. The
      objective of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of using Zevalin in clinical
      practice. This study is also all case investigation of which the enrollment period is five
      years, and all patients who received Zevalin will be recruited and followed 13 weeks after
      the administration.
