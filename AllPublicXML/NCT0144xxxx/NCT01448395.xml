        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures.

          -  Healthy male subjects aged 30-65 years inclusive.

          -  Male subjects should be willing to use an adequate method of contraception (as defined
             in Section 5.1) from the day of dosing until 3 months after dosing with the
             investigational product.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50
             kg and no more than 100 kg.

          -  Clinically normal physical examination and laboratory findings as judged by the
             investigator, including negative test results for drug abuse, alcohol, CO breath test
             and negative test results for Hepatitis B surface antigen, antibodies to Hepatitis C.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant disease or disorder (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic,
             malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment).

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may put the subject at risk because of his participation in the study.

          -  QTc &gt; 450 ms or QT &gt; 500 ms or other ECG abnormality making interpretation more
             difficult, as judged by the investigator, or a history of additional risk factors for
             Torsades de Points (eg heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT
             syndrome).

          -  Radiation exposure from clinical studies, including that from the present study,
             excluding background radiation but including diagnostic X-rays and other medical
             exposures, exceeding 5 mSv in the last twelve months or 10 mSv in the last five years.

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the
             last 3 months.
