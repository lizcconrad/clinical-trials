    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the influence of time-interval between preoperative
      hyperfractionated radiotherapy (5x5 Gy) and surgery on long term overall survival (5 years),
      local and distant recurrence rate, downstaging rate, sphincter saving procedures, radical
      resection rate (R0) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer operated on according to
      TME technique. In particular 3D endosonography and 3rd generation ultrasonic contrast agents
      are evaluated to assess response to radiotherapy.

      The treatment group comprises patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were operated
      on in the 1st Department of General Surgery, Jagiellonian University, Cracow. The data on
      survival has been systematically collected using national census registry. Patients are
      qualified to preoperative radiotherapy 5x5 Gy and then randomly assigned to subgroups with
      different time interval between radiotherapy and surgery: one subgroup consists of patients
      operated on 7-10 days after the end of irradiation, the second subgroup consists of patients
      operated on after 4-5 weeks. Both should be homogenous in sex, age, cancer stage and
      localization, distal and circumferential resection margins, number of resected lymph nodes.
      3D endorectal ultrasound and endorectal ultrasound with SonoVue are performed to assess the
      tumor before and after preoperative radiotherapy.
