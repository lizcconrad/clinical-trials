  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no ideal sedation technique that can be used during Transesophageal Echocardiography
      (TEE), and the data concerning the effects of available sedation techniques on Heart Rate
      Variability (HRV) are limited. In this study the investigators aimed at comparing the effects
      of sedation through hypnotherapy with medical sedation achieved by midazolam on HRV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-six patients with an indication of TEE will be recruited, the age range will be 18-83
      years. In Group Topical (T) there are 26 patients who had the procedure under topical
      pharyngeal anesthesia, in Group Midazolam (D) there are 25 patients who will receive
      midazolam and in Group H there are 27 patients receiving hypnosis. All patients will have an
      IV access; throughout the procedure heart rate, rhythm ECG, peripheric O2 saturation will be
      monitored with a non-invasive monitor, blood pressure measurements were taken every 3
      minutes. Rhythm Holter recordings will be obtained from all patients and TEE will be
      performed.

    <description>Contrary to sedation with midazolam; when hypnosis is used for sedation in TEE patients, autonomic cardiac tone is modified to a significant extent. Hypnotic sedation achieves this by increasing the parasympathetic activity, decreasing the sympathetic activity and changing the sympathovagal interaction balance.</description>
