  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While many patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema) can be managed with topical creams and
      treatments for itch, some children have such severe, long-standing disease that they need
      treatment with oral medications that decrease the ability of the immune system to react.
      However, there is not enough information on the proper use of these medications or how well
      they work compared with each other. The current study looks at the response of children
      treated with these medications to provide this information and improve their use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe and/or refractory cases of atopic dermatitis (AD) can require systemic
      immunosuppressive therapy for disease control, yet there are few studies regarding the
      appropriate use of these drugs for pediatric AD and even less data comparing them. The
      current observational study will observe the effect of these therapies on children with
      moderate to severe atopic dermatitis as they are treated. These drugs being observed will be
      cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of moderate, severe, or very severe atopic dermatitis meeting the Hanifin
             and Rajka criteria

          -  Needs systemic therapy (e.g. cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or
             methotrexate) for severe atopic dermatitis

          -  Subject has severe or recalcitrant disease interrupting daily life as evidenced by
             fulfilling 2 or more of the following 4 criteria:

               -  Failure of multimodal therapy including emollients/barrier repair, topical
                  anti-inflammatory agents (medium to high potency topical corticosteroids, and/or
                  low-potency or topical calcineurin inhibitors if facial/intertriginous areas),
                  and antihistamines

                  phototherapy

             dyscrasias, or central nervous system disorders, such as uncontrolled seizures or
             peripheral neuropathy, or taking systemic medications that could interact adversely
             with the study medicine (e.g. erythromycin use with cyclosporine).

             poses a concern for subject safety while participating on the study.
