  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective randomised study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      ologen CM (Collagen matrix) and Mitomycin-C (MMC) as adjuncts to filtration surgery in
      uncontrolled treated glaucoma cases, the efficacy being the primary objective and the safety
      being the secondary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;ologen Â® CM&quot; is a biodegradable collagen matrix. To prevent episcleral fibrosis and
      subconjunctival scarring thay may result in the surgical failure in trabeculectomy, its
      sporous matrix modulates the migrations and proliferations of fibroblasts to create a
      vascular and long-lasting bleb without the adverse effects, such as avascular thin bleb wall,
      bleb leak, hypotony, and inflammations, potentially caused by the regeneration suppression
      effects upon the use of cytotoxic agents as anti-fibrotic agents, such as MMC (Mitomycin-C)in
      the study.

      Results of ologen CM studies have been published at conferences and published in
      peer-reviewed journals; ologen CM is approved in Europe as an aid for tissue repair, and by
      the FDA in the US as an adjunct in wound management(K080868). In general, over 6,000 ologen
      CM have been implanted worldwide during the past two years with good results and excellent
      safety profile.

      The clinical trial is a phase-IV post-marketing FDA approved device study designed as
      open-label, randomised, parallel, and comparative. 128 patients at 8 sites are anticipated to
      be recruited according to the enrollment criteria, while randomisation will be assigned by a
      sealed envelope system after the patient has signed consent. Trabeculectomy is performed
      thereafter with either MMC or ologen CM applications as described in the protocol with
      postoperative parameters to be measured and analysed with non-parametric tests(Chi-square,
      Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney tests) as well as Kaplan-Meier survival models.

    <description>&quot;Complete success&quot; is consider for IOP less than 21mmHg(inclusive) with no glaucoma medications and with more than 20% reduction(inclusive) from baseline IOP.
Definition of success rate is calculated in percentage by the number of complete success patients over the total sample size.
&quot;Qualified success&quot; that meets the postoperative IOP requirements with postoperative glaucoma medicaitons and &quot;Failure&quot; of meeting the IOP requirements are the other efficacy parameters.
In the specified time frame, patients will also visit for record at day 1, 7, 14, 30, 90, 180 days, 12, 18, and 24 months.</description>

    <description>Place ologen CM on the top of the loosely-sutured scleral flap under conjunctiva before suturing. It is recommended to suture the scleral flap with 1 or 2 stiches loosely for the convenience of future suture lysis and to coordinate with the tamponading effect of ologen CM to create a fluctuating scleral flap that prevents bleb wound adhesion and modulates aqueous humor outflow for ideal IOP control without leakage.</description>

    <description>After outlining and creating a superficial scleral flap, a cellulose sponge soaked with MMC(0.4mg/mL) is applied for up to 3 mins according to physician's routine method of application. The area treated is copiously irrigated with balanced isotonic solution. Alternatively, 15mcg of MMC may be injected intra-Tenon's at the end of the procedure. Patients receiving mitomycin will be billed as per operating room practice.</description>
