             examination

          -  female subjects of childbearing potential, who test negative for pregnancy at
             screening. Male subjects/female subjects of childbearing potential/female subjects who
             have been sterilized by tubal ligation and their partners will be required to use a
             condom (male condom or female condom) used in conjunction with spermicidal gel, foam,
             cream, film, or suppository from the time of screening (female subjects) or dosing
             (male subjects) until 3 months after the last dose of investigational product. Male
             subjects with female partners of childbearing potential and female subjects of
             childbearing potential will be requested to use an additional highly effective form of
             contraception from the first dosing occasion until 3 months after the last dose of
             investigational product. The additional method of contraception can be any of the
             following: diaphragm or cervical vault cap used in conjunction with spermicidal gel,
             foam, cream, film, or suppository; male sterilization, with the appropriate post
             vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate, or for female
             subjects the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject;
             true abstinence (this must be due to subject's lifestyle choice; placement of an
