    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Part A is to determine the safety and tolerability of natalizumab
      administered over 24 weeks in Japanese participants with relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis (MS). The endpoints for this will include assessment of adverse evetns (AEs),
      changes in laboratory evaluations, vital signs, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
      scores, and changes in physical and neurological examination findings. The secondary
      objectives of Part A are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of natalizumab.

      The primary objective of Part B is to determine if natalizumab, when compared to placebo, is
      effective in treating Japanese participants with relapsing-remitting MS, as measured by new
      active lesions on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans over 24 weeks. New active
      lesions are the sum of the gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and any new or newly-enlarging
      T2-hyperintense lesions that do not enhance. The primary endpoint is the rate of development
      of new active lesions over 24 weeks.

      Secondary objectives of Part B are to determine over 24 weeks whether natalizumab, when
      compared to placebo, is effective in reducing the frequency of clinical exacerbations,
      reducing the number of Gd+ lesions, reducing the number of new or newly-enlarging
      T2-hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans, increasing the proportion of relapse-free
      participants, and improving outcomes on visual analog scale (VAS) assessing the participant's
      global impression of his/her well-being. Additional objectives are to assess the safety and
      tolerability, the incidence of serum antibodies to natalizumab and the PK profile of
      natalizumab.

      This multicenter study has 2 parts and is designed to provide data in Japanese participants,
      as required for registration of natalizumab (BG00002) in Japan. Part A will consist of an
      open-label cohort of 12 participants who will receive 300 mg natalizumab intravenously (IV)
      every 4 weeks over a 6-month treatment period. Part B will consist of a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled cohort of approximately 90 participants randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to
      receive IV infusions of placebo or 300 mg BG00002 every 4 weeks over a 6-month period.

          <title>Part A: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
          <description>AE=any untoward medical occurrence that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious AE (SAE)=any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; in the view of the Investigator, was a life threatening event; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may have jeopardized the participant or may have required intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Events were categorized as related or not related; severity was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.</description>
