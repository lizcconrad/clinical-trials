    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cross-over study including 10 stable hemodialysis patients with chronic
      kidney disease stage 5. The cross-over study lasts 2 weeks with the study dialysis sessions
      at midweek.

      During one session, the patient will be dialyzed during 4 hours with high volume post
      dilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) with an FX800 hemodialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care) and a
      blood flow of 300mL/min, dialysate flow of 500mL/min, and substitution flow of 75mL/min.

      During the other midweek session, the patient will be dialyzed during 8 hours with high flux
      hemodialysis (HD) with an FX80 hemodialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care) and a blood flow of
      200mL/min and a dialysate flow of 500mL/min.

      The HDF and HD sessions will be randomized. Blood samples will be drawn pre and post dialysis
      from the arterial blood line, and after 30min after dialysis start, a blood sample will be
      drawn from the inlet and outlet line.

      At the dialysate outlet line, partial dialysate collection is performed at the outlet line.

      Blood and dialysate samples will be analyzed for a broad range of retention solutes like
      small and water soluble solutes, middle molecules, and protein bound solutes.

      These data will be further used to calculate solute removal and evaluate any differences
      between the solute removal during high volume post dilution HDF and high flux HD.
