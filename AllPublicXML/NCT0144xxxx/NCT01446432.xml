    <textblock>
      A study to validate two newly developed questionnaires for Dupuytren's Disease. The objective
      is to develop a patient specific outcomes tool for Dupuytren's Disease. While there are
      standard and validated questionnaire instruments used to measure health related quality of
      life and function, they do not address patient specific issues. The investigators will also
      pilot a treatment/disease specific satisfaction questionnaire for Xiaflex use for Dupuytren's
      Disease.
