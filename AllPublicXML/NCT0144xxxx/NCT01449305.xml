      To evaluate the mean change in menstrual pain intensity during menstrual cycles from baseline
      after wearing Nanoone Woman Underwear in women with primary dysmenorrhea
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severity of dysmenorrhea pain experienced by subjects will be evaluated on a VAS, ranging
      from zero (no pain) to ten (very severe pain). Subjects will be asked to use the VAS scoring
      system to record, on a provided sheet, their experienced menstrual pain level daily during
      menstrual bleeding for a total of three consecutive menstrual cycles.

    <description>Chen Yi Enterprise, Co., Ltd. design a kind of negative ion materials can supply delocalized electron, and add fiber inside, make clothes to wear in the body, no external power or battery, only depend on infrared body photon hit of thermoelectric effect or heart compression pulse, blood flow of piezoelectric, therefore can sustained sufficient amount of effective negative ion, to eliminate positive ions in vivo, or make oxygen free radical to obtain the lack electrons. Decrease active free radical and get non toxic effect in short time.</description>
