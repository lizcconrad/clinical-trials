  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sirukumab as adjunctive treatment to
      antidepressant therapy (monoaminergic antidepressant) where sirukumab (administered as a 50
      milligram (mg) subcutaneous (SC) injection at Day 1, Day 28 and Day 56 during the 12- week
      double-blind treatment period) is compared to adjunctive placebo based on the change from
      baseline to 12-week endpoint in depressive symptoms as measured by the total score on the
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), in participants diagnosed with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD) who have had a suboptimal response to the current standard oral antidepressant
      therapy and have a screening high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) &gt;=0.300 milligram
      per deciliters (mg/dL) (International System of Units (SI) 3.00 mg/L). A cohort of subjects
      with hsCRP &lt;0.300 milligram per deciliter will also be enrolled to allow a better
      understanding of the relationship between CRP and clinical changes.

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of sirukumab as adjunctive treatment to
      a monoaminergic antidepressant in adults with major depressive disorder. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either placebo or sirukumab 50 milligram (mg) at a ratio of 1:1
      at Day 1, 28 and 56. Participants will primarily be assessed for change from baseline in
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) score at Week 12. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upto Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS17 is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in participants diagnosed with depression with a score range of 0 to 52. It is the most widely used symptom severity measure for depression. Each of the 17 items is rated by the clinician on either a 3- or a 5-point scale. The higher the score, the more severe the depression.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure, is a core symptom of depression. The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a short, 14-item instrument to measure anhedonia, which has been shown to be valid and reliable in normal and clinical samples. Each of the 14 items has a set of four response categories: Definitely Agree (= 1), Agree (= 2), Disagree (= 3), and Definitely Disagree (= 4). A higher total score indicates higher levels of state anhedonia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function. The CGI evaluates the severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7. Higher score indicates more severity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD

          -  Must have a HDRS total score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 at screening and predose
             at Day 1, as recorded by the remote independent rater and must not demonstrate an
             improvement of &gt; 25 percent (%) on their HDRS total score from the screening to
             baseline visit

          -  Must be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital
             signs, clinical laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG performed at screening. If there are
             abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the subject's source documents and initialed by the
             investigator

          -  Participants with hypothyroidism who are on stable treatment for 3 months prior to
             screening are required to have thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine
             (FT4) obtained. If the TSH value is out of range, but FT4 is normal, such cases should
             be discussed directly with the medical monitor before the subject is enrolled. If the
             FT4 value is out of range, the participant is not eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other current Axis one psychiatric condition, including, but not limited to, MDD
             with current psychotic features, bipolar disorder (including lifetime diagnosis),
             obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, eating disorder (eg,
             bulimia, anorexia nervosa), or schizophrenia (lifetime). The MINI will be used to
             screen for comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. As noted above, subjects with a diagnosis
             of comorbid GAD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, ADHD,
             Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder with or without agoraphobia or
             Nicotine/Caffeine Dependence may be included, if the investigator considers MDD to be
             the primary diagnosis

          -  A history of alcohol or substance use disorder (abuse/dependence) within 6 months
             prior to screening (nicotine and caffeine dependence are not exclusionary)

          -  A current or recent (within the past year) history of clinically significant suicidal
             ideation (corresponding to a score of &gt;= 3 for ideation) or any suicidal behavior
             within the past year, as validated on the C-SSRS at screening or baseline. Subjects
             with a prior suicide attempt of any sort, or history of prior serious suicidal
             ideation/plan should be carefully screened for current suicidal ideation and only
             included at the discretion of the investigator

          -  More than 3 failed antidepressant treatments (of adequate dose and duration) in the
             current episode of depression (verified by the MGH-ATRQ)

          -  Length of current major depressive episode &gt; 60 months
