  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incontinence is a widespread problem in all health care setting. One of the main
      complications of incontinence is inflammation of the skin in the genital and anal region,
      also known as incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). IAD is a known risk factor of
      pressure ulcer development. Prevalence figures of IAD vary between 5.6% and 50%.

      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a 3-in-1 genital wipe versus
      standard care (traditional water and soap) for the prevention of IAD. The second aim is to
      perform a health economic evaluation of the 3-in-1 genital wipe versus standard care, and
      third to compare the cost of a 2-in-1 total body wash wipe versus standard care for total
      body wash. Other outcomes are the comfort and tolerance of both the nurses and participants.

      In this Randomized Controlled Trial, performed in 13 long-term care settings, the
      participants will undergo a 30 day study period. In the experimental intervention, the
      participants will be washed with body wash wipes and genital wipes. In the control group, the
      subjects will receive traditional care. IAD as well as Pressure Ulcer prevalence will be
      monitored. Subjective and objective time measurements will be performed.
