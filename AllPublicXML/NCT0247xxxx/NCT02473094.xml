      A phase II, randomized study of placebo versus metformin in association to chemotherapy with
      capecitabine and radiation in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced (T3-4N0M0 or
      TxN1-2M0) rectal carcinomas.

      NEOMETRE is a randomized, double blind trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability
      of metformin in association to chemoradiotherapy for the preoperative treatment of locally
      advanced (T3-4N0M0 or TxN1-2M0) rectal carcinomas.

      Patients eligible for this study will be submitted to neoadjuvant 3D radiotherapy with 50,4
      Gray (Gy) divided in 25 applications, in association to capecitabine, 825mg/m2 bid for five
      days every week. The participants will be randomized to daily metformin or placebo during the
      chemoradiotherapy period. The primary end-point is pathological complete response. The
      secondary end-points are recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall
      survival (OS), local recurrence rate, overall response rate, sphincter preservation rate,
      quality of life (QoL) and toxicity.
