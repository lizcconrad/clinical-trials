  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if co-administration of metformin and doxorubicin in
      breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy will reduce the number of
      patients who develop a significant change in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF).

      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II design pilot study in patients with breast cancer
      requiring neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be equally randomized
      to either receive metformin plus standard of care therapy or standard of care therapy alone.
      Patients receiving metformin will continue drug until the doxorubicin-containing cycles are
      complete, unless unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient decides to withdraw from the
      study. Both arms of the study will undergo echocardiograms with contrast at baseline, upon
      completion of doxorubicin-containing cycles (within 28 days of completion), and at the
      one-year and seven-year time points. Additionally biomarker labs will be obtained to explore
      if there is a correlation between change in cardiac activity and the activity of metformin.
      If willing, all enrolled patients will provide a sample of whole blood for further
      exploratory analysis. Symptoms reported during the study will be correlated with know single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found during an exploratory genomic analysis.
