  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of engineers at Michigan State developed a novel waveform analysis technique (&quot;Long
      Time Interval Analysis&quot; [LTIA]) that attempts to estimate cardiac output non-invasively.
      Retrospective comparison of LTIA to invasive techniques (e.g. thermodilution) suggest
      acceptable agreement. Thus, a prospective trial of LTIA is warranted. This study compares
      LTIA to a validated measure of cardiac output - esophageal Doppler monitoring.
