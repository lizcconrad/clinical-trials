      This study evaluates whether whole blood transferred through the new POLFA needle assembly
      meets supernatant hemoglobin acceptability standards.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The POLFA needle is part of the set's PPD (personal protection device) sampling port assembly
      that facilitates safer blood transfer between the collection set (i.e., the diversion pouch)
      and a Vacutainer® for the purpose of viral testing or other testing of the whole blood. The
      POLFA needle assembly was developed as a means to reduce costs while maintaining
      functionality, quality and safety. Since the overall functionality of the POLFA needle was
      designed to be equal to the currently approved Kawasumi needle, a change to the overall
      device safety and use profile is neither anticipated nor intended.

      This trial will serve to generate data sufficient to demonstrate that blood transferred
      through the POLFA needle results in plasma hemoglobin levels below 100mg/dL.

    <description>Ensure that whole blood passed through the POLFA needle assembly (the investigational needle assembly or &quot;INA&quot;) has a supernatant hemoglobin within the acceptable range of &lt; 100mg/dL. In instances where resulting supernatant hemoglobin levels are &gt; 100 mg/dL for the INA, if supernatant hemoglobin levels are &gt; 100 mg/dL for the Kawasumi needle assembly (the control needle assembly or &quot;CNA&quot;), then there would be justification for removing these data from analyses.</description>
