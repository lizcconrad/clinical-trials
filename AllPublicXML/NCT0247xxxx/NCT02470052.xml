  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter,single-arm,open-label study designed to evaluate improvement of lung
      function and safety after treatment with OL-BF-001 for severe emphysema.

      OL-BF-001 consists of a bronchial valve, deployment catheter, loader and airway sizing kit. A
      bronchial valve is a small, umbrella-shaped, one-way valve that is placed inside the airways
      of one lung. It is used to redirect air from the less healthy to the more healthy parts of
      the lung. This helps to reduce over-inflation and may improve overall lung function and
      quality of life for people living with emphysema.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is treated by maximum medical management（ pharmacological therapy and
             nonpharmacological therapy ) for 3 months and over before screening testing and the
             same treatment will be conducted during the study period.

          -  Subject must have severe dyspnea which is defined as a mMRC ≥ 2.

          -  Subject's obstructive disease is severe as defined by following post-bronchodilator
             spirometry values: FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% and 20% of predicted ≤ FEV1 &lt; 50% of predicted

          -  Subject's hyperinflation is defined by: RV/TLC ≥ 40%

          -  Subject has severe emphysema and high heterogeneity defined as: a target lobe with ≥
             50% emphysema involvement and clearly different with the ipsilateral lobe, which is
             judged by visual assessment of thoracic CT. Lung perfusion scan is added to the
             assessment in principle.

          -  The target lobe and ipsilateral lobe will be separated with an intact fissure. An
