      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency of an adapted and &quot;alternate&quot;
      peritoneal dialysis scheme in terms of sodium extraction and purification compared to an
      adapted conventional peritoneal dialysis scheme.

    <description>The first day of the study, patients receive an adapted conventional peritoneal dialysis scheme: 2 cycles of ultrafiltration (stasis: 35 mn ; volume: 650cc/m²) and 2 cycles of purification (stasis: 110 mn ; volume 1200cc/m²).
The second day, patients receive an adapted and alternate scheme: 1 cycle of ultrafiltration (stasis: 35 mn ; volume: 650cc/m²) and 1 cycle of purification (stasis: 110 mn ; volume 1200cc/m²), the two cycles being repeated once.</description>
