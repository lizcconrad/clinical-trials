      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a pressure-wire-based index that is used during coronary
      angiography to assess the potential of a coronary stenosis to induce myocardial ischemia.
      Recent ESC guidelines referred to the usefulness of FFR extensively when noninvasive stress
      imaging is contraindicated, non-diagnostic, or unavailable. However, FFR requires additional
      manipulation with maximal and stable hyperemia by intravenous adenosine. More routine use of
      FFR for all angiographically significant stenoses would add considerable time, cost, and
      complexity to each PCI procedure and might also increase the risk of catheter-related
      complications such as coronary dissection and perforation. Although the guideline mentioned
      that FFR may not be useful in very high grade lesions (angiographically &gt;90%) which always
      have an FFR &lt;0.80, it have not been revealed yet proper criteria to predict FFR &lt;0.80
      obtained by angiographic parameters including degree of stenosis, lesion location and vessel
      size. It would be valuable to find more precise criteria available by conventional
      angiography for discrimination of functional stenosis in way to reduce the risk of additional
      procedure. For the purpose, the investigators will perform FFR in the lesions with
      significant stenosis (&gt;70% diameter stenosis by visual estimation) and compare the
      angiographic parameters and FFR values in the study.

    <description>Coronary lesions with FFR &lt;0.80 will be defined to be related with ischemia. Because all lesions in the study will be angiographically significant stenosis with DS &gt;70%, agreement of diagnosis between FFR-defined ischemia and angiographically significant stenosis will be obtained by the ratio of lesions with FFR &lt;0.80.</description>
