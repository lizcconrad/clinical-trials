      This is a multicenter prospective study that includes all patients with metastatic Renal Cell
      Cancer (RCC) pre- treated with VEGFR TKI in eight Italian cancer centers.

      Everolimus is formulated as tablets of 5-10 mg strength, blister-packed under aluminium foil
      in units of 10 tablets. Prednisone will be dispensed to patients at the dose of 5 mg twice
      daily (BID). Everolimus at dose of 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or two 5 mg tablets). Both drugs
      will be self-administered orally, continuously from Day 1 (Visit 2) until progression of
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation for any other reason.

      A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.

      Title Phase II study of oral PRednisone 5 mg bid plus EVerolimus in patients with metastatic
      renal cell cancer after failure of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (PREV study).

      Short Title/ Acronym PREV Protocol Code IRST189.04 Phase Phase 2 Study Design This is a
      multicenter prospective study that includes all patients with metastatic RCC pre- treated
      with VEGFR TKI in eight Italian cancer centers.

      Study Duration 2 years of recruitment and 1 year of follow-up Study Center(s) multi-center: 8
      centers involved

      Objectives Primary objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of prednisone 5 mg bid and everolimus 10 mg/day in
      RCC.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the activity and the clinical outcome of these patients.

      Exploratory objectives:

      To evaluate the influence of prednisone on trough concentration of everolimus and correlation
      with the incidence of side effects, in particular stomatitis and non-infectious pneumonitis.

      Infiammation markers such as pentraxin 3 (PTX3), IL-6, TGF-β and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio
      will be correlated with clinical outcome (ORR, PFS, OS).

      failed at least one VEGFR TKI.

           and duration of administration Everolimus is formulated as tablets of 5-10 mg strength,
           blister-packed under aluminium foil in units of 10 tablets. Prednisone will be dispensed
           to patients at the dose of 5 mg twice daily (BID). Everolimus at dose of 10 mg (one 10

           death or discontinuation for any other reason.

      Methodology This is a multicenter prospective study that includes all patients with
      metastatic RCC pre- treated with VEGFR TKI in eight Italian cancer centers.

      The study will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Secondary parameters will be analyzed
      exploratively for the intent-to-treat population.
