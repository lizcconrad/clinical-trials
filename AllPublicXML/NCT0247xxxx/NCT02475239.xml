    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
      is the canalith repositioning procedure or the Epley maneuver. Based on the present
      literature, there is controversy on the efficacy of post-maneuver postural restrictions.The
      aim of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the treatment
      efficacy of post-maneuver postural restriction with CRP alone in patients with posterior
      semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

      Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common cause of vertigo. Based on the
      present literature, there is controversy on the efficacy of post-maneuver postural
      restrictions.Some study designs were not randomized controlled trials. The present study
      offers an alternative way of postural restriction to maintain postural restriction as much as
      possible.
