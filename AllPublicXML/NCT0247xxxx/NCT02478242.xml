    <textblock>
      Randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nafamostat mesilate use during
      continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury patients at a high risk of
      bleeding.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to the nafamostat mesilate (NM) group or the no anticoagulant
      (NA) group. In patients assigned to the NM group, NM (20mg/h) was used for maintenance
      anticoagulation. Whereas, in patients assigned to the NA group, normal saline (2mL/h) was
      infused for continuous renal replacement therapy.
