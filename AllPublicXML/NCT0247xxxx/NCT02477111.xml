      INSIGHT is a postmarket clinical follow-up study in the European Union. The purpose of the
      study is to continue to evaluate the safety and effectiveness/performance of Incraft in
      subjects with abdominal aortic aneurysms requiring endovascular repair in routine clinical
      practice. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled and followed through 5-years
      postprocedure. Up to 25 sites in Europe may participate.
