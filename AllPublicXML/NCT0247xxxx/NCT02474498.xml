      To clinically evaluate the treatment of mandibular class II furcation defects with enamel
      matrix derivative (EMD) and/or a bone substitute graft make of beta tricalcium
      phosphate/hydroxyapatite (βTCP/HA). Forty-one patients, presenting a mandibular class II
      buccal furcation defect, probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 4 mm and bleeding on probing, will be
      included. They will be randomly assigned to the groups: 1- EMD (n = 13); 2- βTCP/HA (n = 14);
      3- EMD + βTCP/HA (n = 14). Relative gingival margin position (RGMP), relative vertical and
      horizontal attachment level (RVCAL and RHCAL) and PPD will be evaluated at baseline and 12
      months. The mean horizontal clinical attachment level gain will be considered the primary
      outcome variable.

    <description>The relative horizontal clinical attachment level (RHCAL) will be measured with the same type of probe (PCP-15 Periodontal Probe - Hu-Friedy - Chicago, IL, USA) as the distance between the deepest point reached by the probe when introduced horizontally into the furcation and the lower border of the stent. This parameter will be evaluated at one specific site at the buccal furcation entrance, determined by a groove made on an individually manufactured acrylic stent and recorded to the nearest 0.5mm.</description>

        <description>The relative horizontal clinical attachment level (RHCAL) will be measured with the same type of probe (PCP-15 Periodontal Probe - Hu-Friedy - Chicago, IL, USA) as the distance between the deepest point reached by the probe when introduced horizontally into the furcation and the lower border of the stent. This parameter will be evaluated at one specific site at the buccal furcation entrance, determined by a groove made on an individually manufactured acrylic stent and recorded to the nearest 0.5mm.</description>
