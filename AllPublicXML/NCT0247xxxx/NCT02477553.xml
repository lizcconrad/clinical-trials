  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experts believe that increasing the low uptake of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC)
      requires educating patients about all approved tests and helping them choose one that fits
      their preferences. As one motto puts it: &quot;The best test is the one that gets done.&quot; Screening
      tests range from more invasive and very sensitive for polyps and cancer (colonoscopy) to less
      invasive and less sensitive (e.g., fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)). But it is unclear how
      best to educate patients about the options and the tradeoffs involved. Some guidelines
      recommend that decision aids, a promising tool in this area, provide patients with detailed
      quantitative information, including baseline risk, risk reduction, and chance of negative
      outcomes. But this sort of &quot;comparative effectiveness&quot; data can confuse patients, especially
      those with limited mathematical ability. Previous studies have not measured the effect of
      providing quantitative information to patients with varying levels of ability or interest or
      asked them whether such data is essential for their decision-making.

      The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to determine the impact on patients who view
      a decision aid (DA) that includes quantitative information versus a DA without such data. The
      investigators will also seek to determine whether numeracy moderates the effect of
      quantitative information.
