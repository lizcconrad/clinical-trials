  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of tonsillectomy therapy on IgA nephropathy is still controversial.Few
      prospective,randomized investigations have examined how tonsillectomy affects the shortterm
      and longterm renal outcome of IgA nephropathy.This is A prospective,randomized ,controlled
      study to explore the longterm effect of tonsillectomy for patients with IgA nephropathy.
