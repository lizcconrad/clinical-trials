  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabotegravir (CAB) long-acting (LA) is a promising candidate for human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) due to its potent antiretroviral activity and
      infrequent dosing requirements. Currently, the CAB concentrations achieved in the anatomical
      sites associated with sexual HIV transmission following the proposed 600 milligram (mg)
      intramuscular (IM) PrEP dose are unknown. These data will enhance our understanding of CAB
      distribution to the anatomical mucosal tissue believed to be relevant to sexual HIV-1
      transmission and supplement the data to support future PrEP clinical trial development. The
      primary objective is to determine the PK concentrations of CAB following LA administration in
      plasma and in vaginal tissue (VT), cervical tissue (CT), and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) in
      healthy women and in rectal tissue (RT) and rectal fluid (RF) in healthy men and women
      following a single 600 mg IM dose. This will be a Phase 1, open label study in healthy
      subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics of CAB LA in the plasma and mucosal locations
      associated with sexual HIV-1 transmission: VT, CT, CVF, RT and RF. The study will consist of
      a screening period, a 28-day oral lead-in phase at a dose of 30 mg per day followed by a
      14-42 day washout period, and a single dose of CAB LA 600 mg as an IM (intragluteal)
      injection with compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for up to 12 weeks. Subjects will
      return for safety assessments and plasma PK sampling at Week 24 and Week 36 post-injection
      and undergo a follow-up/withdrawal visit at Week 52 post-injection.
