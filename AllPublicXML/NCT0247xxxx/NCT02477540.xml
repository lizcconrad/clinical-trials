      This clinical trial to study the Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Mesenchymal stem cells in
      critical limb ischemia.

    <textblock>
      If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before
      registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's
      suitability.

      A participant that satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria is assigned a test
      group(2-time injection group).

      Participants conduct cell therapy within 30 days after bone marrow aspiration, and will
      re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 30 days after first injection.

      Participants will make a total of 5 hospital visits after registration, and Safety and
      Efficacy will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit.
