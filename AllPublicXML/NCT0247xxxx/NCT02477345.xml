    <textblock>
      This protocol involves the compassionate use of intravenous fish oil infusion, Omegaven. The
      protocol involves infants and children with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease to
      enable the reversal of elevated serum liver enzymes and direct bilirubin (cholestasis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, patients dependent upon parenteral nutrition (PN) receive parenteral
      fat emulsions composed of soybean oils. Lipids are necessary in PN dependent patients due to
      their high caloric value and essential fatty acid content. Intravenous lipid emulsions have
      been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated liver disease. Phytosterols such as
      those contained in soybean oils are thought to have a deleterious effect on biliary
      secretion. Accumulation of lipids in the hepatic Kupffer cells may further impair liver
      function.

      Omega 6 fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid deficiency, it
      is thought that they are not cleared in a manner similar to enteral chylomicrons and
      therefore accumulate in the liver and resulting in steatotic liver injury (neonatal
      cholestasis). It is hypothesized that a fat emulsion comprised of omega 3 fatty acids (i.e.:
      fish oil), such as de novo lipogenesis, the reduction of arachidonic acid-derived
      inflammatory mediators, prevention of essential fatty acid deficiency through the presence of
      small amounts of arachidonic acid, and improved clearance of lipids from the serum. Animal
      studies have shown that IV fat emulsions such as fish oil that are high in eicosapentaenic
      and docosahexaenoic acid reduce impairment of bile flow which is seen in cholestasis caused
      by conventional fat emulsions. Furthermore, intravenous omega-e fatty acids are well
      tolerated and might reduce the hepatic dysfunction. By administering Omegaven in place of
      conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsion, the progression of PN-associated cholestasis
      can be prevented or reversed.

    <description>Omegaven will be initiated at a dose of 0.5 gram/Kg/day and is infused over 24 hours for 1-2 days, and then advanced to
1 gram/Kg/day. Omegaven will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter alone or in conjunction with parenteral nutrition. Omegaven will continue until weaned from PN. Monotherapy with Omegaven can continue as an additional source of calories after the dextrose/protein portion of PN is discontinued. Omegaven may be restarted within seven days of discontinuing therapy. After seven days, and meeting inclusion criteria, Omegaven can resume at the initial dose of 0.5 grams/Kg/day, advancing to 1 gm/kg/day.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects will be infants and children from birth to 5 years of age

          -  diagnosis of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) (defined as two
             consecutive direct bilirubin levels of 2 mg/dl or more) in a parenteral
             nutrition-dependent infant or child.

          -  subject must have utilized standard therapies to prevent the progression of the
             cholestasis including reduction/removal of copper and manganese from daily PN, trial
             of enteral feedings if possible, and the use of ursodiol and/or phenobarbital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients are excluded if they have other documented causes of chronic liver disease
             (i.e.: Hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, alpha-1-anti-trypsin
             deficiency),

          -  or already have signs of proven severe advanced liver disease including cirrhosis on
             biopsy, varices, ascites.

        Additional exclusion criteria:

          -  an active coagulopathy characterized by ongoing bleeding or by a requirement for
             clotting factor replacement (e.g. fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) to maintain
             homeostasis

          -  impaired lipid metabolism

          -  severe hyperlipidemia with or without pancreatitis

          -  unstable diabetes mellitus

          -  hyperglycemia

          -  stroke, embolism

          -  collapse and shock

          -  recent myocardial infarction (MI)

          -  cholestasis due to any reason other than parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis
             (PNAC)

          -  active new infection at time of initiation of Omegaven

          -  hemodynamic instability

          -  patient cannot be enrolled in any other clinical trial involving an investigational
             agent (unless approved by the designated physicians on the multidisciplinary team)
