  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multiple dosing (14 Â± 1 days), placebo-controlled,
      incomplete block crossover, multi-center study to assess efficacy and safety of 3 dose levels
      of AZD7594, given once daily by inhalation, in patients with mild to moderate asthma.

      This multi-center study will be conducted at multiple sites in Europe. It is planned that
      approximately 48 patients with mild to moderate asthma will be randomized into the study

    <description>The efficacy of AZD7594 was assessed in terms of change in nighttime awakenings in each treatment period.

    <description>The efficacy of AZD7594 was assessed in terms of change in daily symptom score from baseline to average of treatment period post dose (Day 1-14) in each treatment period. Severity scores for asthma symptoms were recorded twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening with the scoring system of 0-no asthma symptoms, 1-toleratable asthma symptoms, 2-discomfort asthma symptoms with normal activities (or with sleep) and 3-asthma symptoms with impaired normal activities (or to sleep).</description>

    <description>The efficacy of AZD7594 was assessed in terms of amount of asthma control days in each treatment period. An asthma control day was defined as a day with asthma symptom score = 0, a night with no awakenings due to asthma symptoms and a day with no use of rescue medication. A given calendar day was defined as an asthma control day if it fulfills the criteria for a symptom-free day and for a rescue medication-free day</description>

        <title>Efficacy of AZD7594 by Assessment of the Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (mPEF) Before Administration Over the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The efficacy of AZD7594 was assessed in terms of change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (mPEF) before administration of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in each treatment period. The first PEF measurement was on the evening of Visit 1. Every morning and every evening after Visit 1, patients were required to perform 3 maneuvers for PEF assessment. The highest value from among the 3 assessments was marked as mPEF with the date and time of the measurement. The final PEF assessment was done on the morning of Visit 11 (Day 15 of Treatment Period 3).</description>
        <time_frame>Every morning at pre-dose from Day 1 to Day 15</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of randomized study drug, were included in the FAS, following the principle of ITT. Participants were included in the analysis according to the treatment to which they were randomized.</population>

          <title>Efficacy of AZD7594 by Assessment of the Change From Baseline to Day 8 in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5</title>
          <description>The efficacy of AZD7594 was assessed in terms of change from baseline to Day 15 in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 in each treatment period. Five questions were asked and each question was scored on a scale of 0 to 6, where a lower score represents a more severe impairment/symptom. The ACQ-5 score at a given visit was defined as the average of the scores given for each of the questions, calculated as ACQ-5 score = Sum of 5 scores/5.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of randomized study drug, were included in the FAS, following the principle of ITT. Participants were included in the analysis according to the treatment to which they were randomized.</population>

        <title>Efficacy of AZD7594 by Assessment of Asthma Control Days</title>
        <description>The efficacy of AZD7594 was assessed in terms of amount of asthma control days in each treatment period. An asthma control day was defined as a day with asthma symptom score = 0, a night with no awakenings due to asthma symptoms and a day with no use of rescue medication. A given calendar day was defined as an asthma control day if it fulfills the criteria for a symptom-free day and for a rescue medication-free day</description>

        <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of randomized study drug, were included in the FAS, following the principle of ITT. Participants were included in the analysis according to the treatment to which they were randomized.</population>
