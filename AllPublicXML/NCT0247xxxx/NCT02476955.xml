      This is an open-label Phase 1b, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 092 administered in
      combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Arm) or in
      combination with paclitaxel alone (Paclitaxel Arm) in subjects with advanced, inoperable
      metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors, or in combination with anastrozole (Anastrozole
      Arm) in subjects with ovarian or endometrial cancer. Only subjects with endometrial cancer
