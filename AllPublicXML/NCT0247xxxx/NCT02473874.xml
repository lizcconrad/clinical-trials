  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain skin spectroscopic data from two imaging systems.

      Comparison groups:

        -  Skin Spect dermoscope

        -  Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researcher can compare the spectroscopic data from the two systems as well as the
      relative concentrations of melanin, oxy- and deoxy- hemoglobin calculated from the
      measurements.

      Skin Spect can measure larger area of skin, whereas Spatially modulated quantitative
      spectrometer is a point-based measurement.Therefore, larger nevi will require multiple
      Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer measurements for comparison with corresponding
      sub-regions of the larger Skin Spect measurements. Only sub-regions of the image data from
      Skin Spect that match the locations Spatially modulated quantitative spectrometer acquired
      data will be used in this correlation study.

      This researcher ensure that the spectral data collected by the two instruments are collected
      from the same spatial locations, should lesion heterogeneity be present.
