  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of IdeS in the transplantation setting. Each
      patient will receive one dose of IdeS. If the crossmatch test is negative at the time of
      transplantation, the patient will be transplanted with a kidney from a deceased or living
      donor. The starting dose will be 0.25 mg/kg BW, given as a single intravenous infusion prior
      to surgery.

      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the IgG degrading cysteine protease IdeS in
      the transplantation setting. Patients with DSAs will be treated with IdeS prior to
      transplantation. Each patient will receive one dose of IdeS. If the crossmatch test is
      negative after IdeS treatment, the patient will be transplanted with a kidney from a deceased
      or living donor. Two to four dose groups are planned. Each group will contain 2 patients with
      the possibility to extend the group to up to 4 patients per group if required for safety
      and/or efficacy evaluation. The starting dose will be 0.25 mg/kg BW, given as a single
      intravenous infusion prior to surgery with the possibility to increase the dose in higher
      dose groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with CKD and in dialysis with preformed anti-HLA antibodies
             (non-DSA, DSA or both), negative T-CDC CXM and at least one antibody MFI &gt; 3000

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy within 2 years excluding adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ and prostate cancer Gleason &lt;6 and
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &lt;10 ng/mL.

          -  Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV

          -  Clinical signs of ongoing infectious disease.

          -  Severe other conditions requiring treatment and close monitoring, e.g. cardiac failure
             &gt; New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade 3, unstable coronary disease or oxygen
             dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

          -  History of any other clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may either put the patient at increased risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the patient's ability to
             participate in the study

          -  Hypogammaglobulinemia defined as any values of P-total IgG less than 3 g/L

          -  History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as
             judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar
             chemical structure or class to IdeS (e. g streptokinase and/or staphylokinase)

          -  Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) or has participated in any other clinical study that included
             drug treatment within 4 months of the first administration of investigational product
             in this study.

          -  Patients consented and screened but not dosed in previous studies are not excluded
