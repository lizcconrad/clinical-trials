      Study the influence of transfusion related Patient Blood Management Program actions on
      transfusion-related outcome measures and cost.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the University Hospital of Zurich, an in-house designed monitoring and feedback system was
      introduced which electronically registers each transfusion of any allogeneic blood product,
      be it red blood cells, plasma or platelets as well as corresponding laboratory data. Results
      are reported quarterly to Department heads. The investigator analyzes whether the
      introduction of this monitoring and feedback system as part of a patient blood management
      Program has a significant influence on use of allogeneic blood product transfusions and
      transfusion-related costs, without compromising patient outcome.
