  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BIND-014 (docetaxel nanoparticles for injectable suspension) is being studied in patients
      with advanced urothelial carcinoma, cervical cancer, cholangiocarcinoma or carcinomas of the
      biliary tree and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Ferumoxytol imaging will also be investigated at US sites as an exploratory endpoint.
