  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate information to determine which operations and
      treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease or similar diseases of the stomach, esophagus
      or digestive tract are providing the most benefit including the long-term effects of
      treatment (or no treatment) and the progression of the disease over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in this registry will have a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease or a
      similar disease of the stomach, esophagus or digestive tract. Each patient undergoing
      anti-reflux surgery will be asked to participate in the registry to gather preoperative,
      intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. The data collected from the registry will be used
      to assess the outcome of various treatments, both standard and new: some specific areas of
      interest include the long-term effects of treatment (or no treatment), the progression of the
      disease over time, and the overall length of survival of the patient.
