      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on
      serum concentrations of Brain Natriuretic Peptide and C - reactive protein in patients with
      cardiovascular disease. Patients were divided randomly into two groups: control and
      experimental aerobic group. This study was done with two - stage blood sampling: at the
      beginning and at the end of the treatment phase. All subjects were requested to avoid any
      exercise at least 48 hours before blood sampling. To study Brain Natriuretic Peptide and C -
      reactive protein changes, 5 milliliters of blood were taken from patient's brachial vein.
      Blood samples for subsequent measurements were frozen immediately and transported to the
      Hormone Laboratory for serum separation. The experimental group did the aerobic exercise
      programs for 8 weeks for 3 sessions per week and the control group did not receive any
      training. After completion of training, the final blood samplings were performed. Exercise
      intensity according to the heart rate remained stable until the last week. Brain Natriuretic
      Peptide and C - reactive protein levels were measured by ELISA tests. All statistical
      analysis were done using SPSS software (version 16) and at the significance level of pâ‰¤ 0.05
