    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is an important problem in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery
      and associated with more complicated hospital course, increased hospital length of stay and
      total postoperative cost. A study shows that a low preoperative cerebral oximetry (rSO2) is
      associated with postoperative delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery. Another study showed
      that patients who underwent cardiac surgery with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity
      in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) preoperatively are at greater risk for postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that lower
      perioperative rSO2 and reduced preoperative mean flow velocity (MFV) of MCA are good
      predictors of the postoperative delirium in the patients undergoing the on-pump cardiac
      surgery.

    <description>The presence and severity of delirium were assessed with Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) once a day. The investigators plan to evaluate whether perioperative rSO2 and/or MFV of MCA can predict postoperative delirium in patients undergoing the on-pump cardiac surgery and to assess the predictive power of perioperative rSO2/MFV of MCA regarding postoperative delirium. Perioperative rSO2 was observed during surgery (an expected average of 4 hours) and MVF of MCA was measured just before the induction of general anesthesia.</description>
