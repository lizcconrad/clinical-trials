  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The substance ingenol mebutate (IM) is registered in Switzerland and many countries worldwide
      for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK). There is no data on the use of IM in organ
      transplant recipients, a population highly affected by AK and skin cancer at large. The
      investigators want to study the use of IM against AK in this high-risk group of patients and
      assess its safety. The investigators are hoping to prove that IM is safe to use in AK of
      organ transplant recipients, allowing its use in the clinical routine treatement of AK also
      in this subset of patients with AK.

      Ingenol mebutate gel, 0.05%, commercially supplied in a box of 2 single use, unit dose tubes
      for topical application for each 25cm2, four conjunctive 25cm2 areas (100cm2) will be
      treated. If the 100 cm2 area is not cleared at Day 57 (+/- 3 Days), a second treatment cycle
      will be initiated with commercially supplied drug in a box of 2 single use, unit dose tubes
      for topical application for each 25cm2 and four conjunctive 25cm2 areas (100cm2 ) will be
      treated. In total for the first cycle, 4 commercially supplied boxes (8 unit dose tubes) will
      be used, and for the second cycle an additional 4 commercially supplied boxes (8 unit dose
      tubes) will be used (in total 8 boxes, 16 unit dose tubes per patient).
