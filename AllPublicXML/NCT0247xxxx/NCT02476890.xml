    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of a single dose of gefapixant
      100 mg on cough reflex sensitivity to various challenge agents (capsaicin, citric acid,
      adenosine triphosphate [ATP], and distilled water) in healthy and chronic cough participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study had a Screening period to determine participant inclusion, two Baseline Visits, and
      two treatment periods with a minimum 48-hour washout between the treatment periods. At
      Baseline and during each treatment period, cough sensitivity was measured by standard
      clinical methodology incorporating four cough challenges. Daytime cough monitoring was
      performed at Baseline and during each of the two treatment periods (chronic cough
      participants only).

    <measure>Cough Reflex Sensitivity to Capsaicin in Participants Who Received Gefapixant 100 mg and Placebo (Period 1 &amp; Period 2 Combined)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of capsaicin inducing at least 2 coughs (C2) and at least 5 coughs (C5) was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose in healthy and chronic cough participants. The concentrations of capsaicin for cough challenge were 0.3 micromoles (µM), 1 µM, 3 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, 300 µM, and 1000 µM. The Measure Type is least-squares mean in natural log scale. The challenge agent was prepared by dilution of capsaicin with saline, and was administered by inhalation. A mixed effects model used natural log-transformed values for the lowest concentrations of inhaled solution required to evoke at least 2 (C2) or at least 5 (C5) coughs to estimate the average of C2 or C5 across 3 time points for each treatment group, and to compare treatment difference relative to placebo. When applying the mixed model repeated measure analysis, if there is a missing value for concentration, it was imputed as 1.5 times the maximum concentration (=150%).</description>

    <description>The concentration of citric acid inducing at least 2 coughs (C2) and at least 5 coughs (C5) was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose in healthy and chronic cough participants. The concentrations of citric acid for cough challenge were 1 millimoles (mM), 3 mM, 10 mM, 30 mM, 100 mM, 300 mM, 1 M, and 3 M. The Measure Type is least-squares mean in natural log scale. The challenge agent was prepared by dilution of citric acid with saline, and was administered by inhalation. A mixed effects model used natural log-transformed values for the lowest concentrations of inhaled solution required to evoke at least 2 (C2) or at least 5 (C5) coughs to estimate the average of C2 or C5 across 3 time points for each treatment group, and to compare treatment difference relative to placebo.

    <time_frame>Average of 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of distilled water inducing at least 2 coughs (C2) and at least 5 coughs (C5) was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose in healthy and chronic cough participants. The concentrations of distilled water for cough challenge were 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%. The Measure Type is least-squares mean in natural log scale. The number of coughs generated in 1 minute of exposure was recorded. The challenge agent was prepared by dilution of distilled water with saline, and was administered by inhalation. A mixed effects model used natural log-transformed values for the lowest concentrations of inhaled solution required to evoke at least 2 (C2) or at least 5 (C5) coughs to estimate the average of C2 or C5 across 3 time points for each treatment group, and to compare treatment difference relative to placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) After Cough Challenge Testing in Participants Who Received Gefapixant 100 mg and Placebo (Chronic Cough Participants Only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one hour after the final cough challenge on treatment days</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic cough participants completed a visual analogue scale (VAS) to record cough severity, prior to dosing on the treatment day in each treatment period, and one hour after the final cough challenge on the treatment days. This was a 100mm VAS of cough severity from 'No Cough' (0) up to 'Worst Cough' (100). Participants were instructed to draw a line on the scale to indicate how severe they felt their cough was during the previous 1 hour on the treatment days. A negative change from Baseline was considered to indicate improvement in cough severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and one hour after final cough challenge on treatment days</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic cough participants completed a VAS to record the severity of their urge to cough, prior to dosing on the treatment day in each treatment period, and one hour after the final cough challenge on the treatment days. Participants marked the 100mm VAS at the extremes as 'No urge-to-cough' (0) and 'Worst urge-to-cough' (100). Participants were instructed to draw a single vertical line on the scale to indicate how severe their urge to cough was during the previous 1 hour on the treatment days. A negative change from Baseline was considered to indicate improvement in urge to cough.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events During Study Treatment and Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 18</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary endpoint of the trial was the percentage of participants receiving gefapixant 100 mg and placebo who had at least 1 adverse event (AE) over 4 days of treatment (including washout periods) in addition to 14 days (+3 days) until a post-treatment follow-up visit. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug is also an AE. The percentage of participants in any treatment group with at least 1 AE was assessed.</description>

        <title>Cough Reflex Sensitivity to Capsaicin in Participants Who Received Gefapixant 100 mg and Placebo (Period 1 &amp; Period 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>The concentration of capsaicin inducing at least 2 coughs (C2) and at least 5 coughs (C5) was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose in healthy and chronic cough participants. The concentrations of capsaicin for cough challenge were 0.3 micromoles (µM), 1 µM, 3 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, 300 µM, and 1000 µM. The Measure Type is least-squares mean in natural log scale. The challenge agent was prepared by dilution of capsaicin with saline, and was administered by inhalation. A mixed effects model used natural log-transformed values for the lowest concentrations of inhaled solution required to evoke at least 2 (C2) or at least 5 (C5) coughs to estimate the average of C2 or C5 across 3 time points for each treatment group, and to compare treatment difference relative to placebo. When applying the mixed model repeated measure analysis, if there is a missing value for concentration, it was imputed as 1.5 times the maximum concentration (=150%).</description>

        <title>Cough Reflex Sensitivity to ATP in Participants Who Received Gefapixant 100 mg and Placebo (Period 1 &amp; Period 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>The concentration of ATP inducing at least 2 coughs (C2) and at least 5 coughs (C5) was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours post-dose in healthy and chronic cough participants. The concentrations of ATP for cough challenge were 0.1 mM, 0.3 mM, 1 mM, 3 mM, 10 mM, 30 mM, 100 mM, and 300 mM. The Measure Type is least-squares mean in natural log scale. The challenge agent was prepared by dilution of ATP with saline, and was administered by inhalation. A mixed effects model used natural log-transformed values for the lowest concentrations of inhaled solution required to evoke at least 2 (C2) or at least 5 (C5) coughs to estimate the average of C2 or C5 across 3 time points for each treatment group, and to compare treatment difference relative to placebo. When applying the mixed model repeated measure analysis, if there is a missing value for concentration, it was imputed as 1.5 times the maximum concentration (=150%).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) After Cough Challenge Testing in Participants Who Received Gefapixant 100 mg and Placebo (Chronic Cough Participants Only)</title>
        <description>Chronic cough participants completed a visual analogue scale (VAS) to record cough severity, prior to dosing on the treatment day in each treatment period, and one hour after the final cough challenge on the treatment days. This was a 100mm VAS of cough severity from ‘No Cough’ (0) up to ‘Worst Cough’ (100). Participants were instructed to draw a line on the scale to indicate how severe they felt their cough was during the previous 1 hour on the treatment days. A negative change from Baseline was considered to indicate improvement in cough severity.</description>

        <description>A secondary endpoint of the trial was the percentage of participants receiving gefapixant 100 mg and placebo who had at least 1 adverse event (AE) over 4 days of treatment (including washout periods) in addition to 14 days (+3 days) until a post-treatment follow-up visit. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

          <description>A secondary endpoint of the trial was the percentage of participants receiving gefapixant 100 mg and placebo who had at least 1 adverse event (AE) over 4 days of treatment (including washout periods) in addition to 14 days (+3 days) until a post-treatment follow-up visit. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug is also an AE. The percentage of participants in any treatment group with at least 1 AE was assessed.</description>
