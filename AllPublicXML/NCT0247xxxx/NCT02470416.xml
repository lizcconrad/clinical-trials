  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the prevalence of small bowel polyps in patients with sporadic
      Duodenal/Ampullary polyps. The investigators aim to investigate the prevalence of small bowel
      polyps in patients with sporadic (ie not related to FAP or PJS) duodenal/ampullary adenomas
      by performing small bowel capsule endoscopy and comparing the results to those acquired from
      a control cohort undergoing VCE for accepted indication at our centre.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigation for suspected SB tumors is an acceptable indication for VCE. SB polyps occur
      frequently in patients with FAP/PJS and in patients with FAP, they are significantly more
      common in patients with Duodenal/Ampullary polyps. Little is known about the prevalence of
      small bowel polyps in patients with sporadic Duodenal/Ampullary polyps.

      The primary hypothesis is that patients with sporadic (ie not related to FAP or PJS)
      duodenal/ampullary adenomas have a higher prevalence of small bowel polyps compared with
      patients undergoing VCE for various indications who have not had a duodenal polyp diagnosed
      or removed.

      Patients who have had a previous diagnosis and/or treatment of a duodenal/ampullary polyp at
      Westmead hospital will receive VCE examination. Control population will consist of age
      matched controls having VCE for OGIB/IDA at Westmead hospital. Patients will be required to
      have had a documented colonoscopy within the previous three years. If colonoscopy was not
      performed within this time frame, the patient will have a colonoscopy as part of the study
      protocol.
