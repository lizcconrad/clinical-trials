  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare tumors (2-4 cases/million/year) that originate from
      musculoaponeurotic structures. Although they are benign tumors with no metastatic potential,
      DT are considered as locally aggressive tumors, with local invasiveness and tissue
      destruction, leading to pain, and disability. Surgery remains the keystone of therapy, but is
      limited by the anatomical situation of extra-abdominal desmoid (EAD) tumors (chest wall, root
      members). In patients where surgery is considered, negative-margin resection (R0) is
      recommended, but this frequently results in cosmetic/functional impairment. Moreover,
      prognostic impact of R0 resections remains controversial. The outcome after initial surgery
      depends upon several factors such as age, tumor site, and tumor size as demonstrated by
      recent data from the French Sarcoma Group.

      Alternative therapies to DT surgery for front-line or recurrence include NSAID's,
      anti-estrogens alone or in combination, -interferon, chemotherapy, targeted therapies or
      radiation therapy. All of these medical approaches however may fail to achieve long-term
      disease control and a number of patients suffer from irreducible pain, and disability from
      tumor volume.

      Cryoablation is a promising technique that is suitable for patients experiencing
      extra-abdominal DT. The procedure is based on repeated cycles of freezing/passive thawing of
      the tumor, leading to cell death. The technique has many advantages, among which: the
      accurate control of iceball under real-time MRI or CT-scan monitoring (that is not possible
      with other techniques such as radiofrequency), the lack of mutilation, the possibility of
      repeating the procedure. The cryoablation procedure has proven to be beneficial for the
      treatment of various tumors (liver metastases, breast, kidney). Recently, percutaneous
      cryotherapy has been reported in the treatment of EAD tumors poorly suited to surgery, with
      promising results.

      In the light of these encouraging data, it is believed that patients with extra-abdominal DT
      not amenable to surgery unless unacceptable surgical sequel and progressing after at least
      two lines of adequate medical therapy (tamoxifen, NSAID or chemotherapy), could benefit from
      the cryoablation procedure. Tumor cryotherapy-induced regression should allow symptoms
      relief, prolonged progression-free survival and a better quality of life.

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Tumor deemed accessible for cryoablation procedure by the operator in the investigator
             center

          -  At least one measurable lesion (RECIST v1.1) using MRI (gadolinium injection
             mandatory)

          -  90 % of destruction of the tumor achievable in one procedure of cryoablation with a
