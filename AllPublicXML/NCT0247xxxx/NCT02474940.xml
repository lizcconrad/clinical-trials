  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often have pain and/or fatigue. Unfortunately, available
      treatments provide inadequate relief for the majority of these individuals. There remains an
      urgent need for additional treatment options for MS-related symptoms. The purpose of this
      study is to see if alternative treatments that involve self-hypnosis training, neurofeedback
      training and/or mindfulness meditation training, or a combination of some of these treatments
      can help decrease pain and fatigue in people with MS. A subject must have a diagnosis of MS,
      have chronic pain and/or fatigue, and be at least 18 years old to participate, among other
      criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals from the study's recruitment sources with an MS diagnosis will be contacted by
      research staff via telephone and invited to be screened for participation. In addition,
      individuals interested in participating may contact research staff upon learning about the
      study through a description listed on an approved website, flyer, or a referral. Research
      staff will use a recruitment script for purposes of screening subjects and explaining the
      study. In addition, the initial screening process will also include a 6-item cognitive
      screening and a psychological screening assessment done by a licensed clinician.

      Research staff will verify the MS diagnosis of prospective subjects who have not been
      'pre-verified' in one of three ways during the recruitment process:

        1. Research staff will attempt to determine whether a subject has a University of
           Washington Medical Center (UWMC) or Harborview Medical Center (HMC) medical record by
           conducting a simple search using a secure application.

           If research staff are unable to locate a medical record for the prospective subject, or
           if the individual contacts research staff after seeing the study description on an
           approved website or flyer, then one of two options will be pursued:

        2. Subjects will be asked during the initial screening process if staff may review their
           medical records if they have received services at the UWMC/HMC since their diagnosis;

        3. Subjects will be asked during the initial screening process if staff may contact a
           physician of their choice to verify their diagnosis if (a) they have not received
           services at the UWMC/HMC since their diagnosis; (b) they refuse to give staff permission
           to review their UWMC/HMC medical records; or (c) staff for some reason cannot find a
           UWMC/HMC medical record despite the subject attesting to being a patient at one time at
           the UWMC/HMC and giving staff permission to review his/her records.

      Only individuals whose diagnosis has been verified (either via medical record review prior
      to/during screening or through verification via the subject's physician depending on
      recruitment source) will proceed with the psychological screening assessment.

      Once a prospective subject has been screened as eligible and gotten their MS diagnosis
      verified, research staff will arrange a time and date for the prospective subject to
      participate in a telephone psychological screening assessment with one of the study's
      licensed clinicians. The study clinician will ask potential subjects some questions to assess
      the presence of active suicidal ideation or paranoid thoughts using an assessment sheet.
      Individuals who do have these types of thoughts will not be eligible for the study.
      Individuals will be referred to a mental health professional if he or she needs immediate
      attention.

      Research staff will then arrange a time with the subject to attend an in-person initial
      intake session. At the beginning of the initial intake session, research staff will review a
      consent form with the subject and answer any questions he/she may have. The subject will
      complete and sign the consent form if he/she would like to participate. If the subject
      decides to enroll in the study, he/she will then be asked to participate in a relaxation and
      hypnotic exercise, and provide basic demographic and contact information, as well as
      information about their MS diagnosis and pain and/or fatigue problem(s) he/she experiences.
      The initial intake session will last about 1.5 hours depending on the subject's answers.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of three
      treatment interventions. All three treatment interventions involve learning self-hypnosis
      techniques. During self-hypnosis, subjects learn to enter a state of focused attention, and
      then change how they experience pain and/or fatigue. Two of the three treatment interventions
      will also include mindfulness meditation or neurofeedback training. Investigators are
      interested in comparing the three different approaches to treating chronic pain and/or
      fatigue.

      A research staff member will also contact each subject four times by telephone during his/her
      participation in the study to complete three short interviews or assessments, 3-5 minutes
      long, and one longer assessment, about 30-40 minutes long, in a period of one week. These
      assessments will be completed one week prior to the treatment period, about halfway through
      the treatment period, after the completion of treatment, and 1-month after the subject
      completes treatment. The three shorter assessments will include questions about pain
      intensity. The fourth longer assessment will include questions about such things as how the
      subject thinks about pain and fatigue, treatments for pain and/or fatigue the subject has
      received, medications or drugs the subject has used, and any depressive symptoms the subject
      may have experienced.

    <description>Intervention #1 consists of 11 treatment sessions over 6-12 weeks (1-2 sessions/week on average). Sessions 1-6 will involve neurofeedback training. During neurofeedback training, sensors will be placed on a subject's head and ears, and s/he will be able to hear sounds on a computer that correspond to his/her brainwaves. The subject will learn how to change his/her brainwaves by changing the sounds heard. Session 7 will be a face-to-face self-hypnosis session. During self-hypnosis training, subjects will learn to enter a state of focused attention, and then change how he/she experiences pain and/or fatigue. In sessions 8-11, subjects will listen to an audio recording of a self-hypnosis training session. Subjects will complete one neurofeedback training session immediately before each of these four hypnosis sessions. A relaxation and hypnotic exercise will also be done during two of the 11 sessions.</description>

    <description>Intervention #2 consists of 11 treatment sessions over 6-12 weeks (1-2 sessions/week on average). Sessions 1-6 will involve mindfulness meditation training. During mindfulness training, subjects will be asked to focus their attention on an object of awareness, such as their breath. Subjects will then be asked to focus on their feelings/thoughts during the training. Session 7 will be a face-to-face self-hypnosis session. During self-hypnosis training, subjects will learn to enter a state of focused attention, and then change how he/she experiences pain and/or fatigue. In sessions 8-11, subjects will listen to an audio recording of a self-hypnosis training session. Subjects will complete one mindfulness meditation training session immediately before each of these four hypnosis sessions. A relaxation and hypnotic exercise will be done during two of the 11 sessions.

    <description>Intervention #3 consists of five treatment sessions of self-hypnosis training during the treatment phase of the study (1-2 sessions/week on average). The treatment phase of the study will last about 6-12 weeks. During the first 4-5 weeks, subjects in Intervention #3 will not be asked by study researchers to do anything. At the end of this waiting period, subjects will complete a set of telephone interviews. Subjects will then attend one face-to-face self-hypnosis training session. During self-hypnosis training, subjects will learn to enter a state of focused attention, and then change how he/she experiences pain and/or fatigue. In the last four sessions, subjects will listen to an audio recording of a self-hypnosis training session. A relaxation and hypnotic exercise will also be done during two of the five sessions.</description>
