      This study will assess the safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime avibactam
      and metronidazole versus meropenem in paediatric population (from 3 months to less than 18
      years of age )with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs)

    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, multinational, single blind, randomised and active controlled trial of
      intravenous ceftazidime avibactam in combination with metronidazole versus meropenem.
      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie,
      9 doses) before having the option to switch to an oral therapy. The decision to switch to
      oral therapy is entirely at the Investigator's discretion, if the patient has good or
      sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.Patients will
      be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study, and blood samples will be taken for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. The duration of each patient's participation in the study
      will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 days after start of study treatment (defined
      as the time point at which first dose of study treatment is administered) at which time there
      will be a late follow up (LFU) assessment visit. The LFU is to be performed 20 to 35 days
      after the last dose of any treatment.The assessments at the test of cure (TOC) visit should
      be performed in person 8 to 15 days after last dose of any study drug (IV or oral). The
      maximum duration of IV study drug or oral switch therapy is up to Day 15.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be ≥3 calendar months to &lt;18 years of age. Patients aged ≥3 calendar months to &lt;1
             year must have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks).

          2. Written informed consent from parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative(s),
             and informed assent from patient (if age appropriate according to local regulations)

          3. If female and has reached menarche, or has reached Tanner stage 3 development (even if
             not having reached menarche) (refer to Appendix E for further details on Tanner
             staging), the patient is authorised to participate in this clinical study if the
             following criteria are met:

        At screening:

        (i) Patient reports sexual abstinence for the prior 3 months or reports use of at least 1
        of the acceptable methods of contraception, including an intrauterine device (with copper
        banded coil), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (eg, Mirena®), or regular
        medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera®); or (b) Patient agrees to initiate sexual
        abstinence from the time of screening until 7 days after end of treatment with study drug;
        and (ii) Patient is advised to avoid conception from the time of screening until 7 days
        after receipt of study drug and agrees not to attempt pregnancy from the time of screening
        until 7 days after end of treatment with study drug; and (iii) Patient is provided
        guidelines regarding continuation of abstinence, initiation of abstinence, or about allowed
        contraception; and (iv) Patient has a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
        test just prior to study entry. Since serum tests may miss an early pregnancy, relevant
        menstrual history and sexual history, including methods of contraception, should be
        considered. Note: if the result of the serum β-hCG test cannot be obtained prior to dosing
        of investigational product, a patient may be enrolled on the basis of a negative urine
        pregnancy test, though a serum β-hCG test result must still be obtained.

        4. Must, based on the judgment of the Investigator, require hospitalisation initially and
        antibacterial therapy for 7 to 15 days in addition to surgical intervention for the
        treatment of the current cIAI 5. Require surgical intervention (eg, laparotomy,
        laparoscopic surgery or percutaneous drainage) to manage the cIAI 6. Must have clinical
        evidence of cIAI as follows: (i) Pre-operative enrolment inclusion:

          1. Requires surgical intervention that is expected to be completed within 24 hours of
             enrolment Laparotomy, laparoscopy, or percutaneous drainage

             Abdominal pain and/or tenderness Localised or diffuse abdominal wall rigidity
             Abdominal mass

          4. Intention to send specimens from the surgical intervention for culture

          5. (Optional) Supportive radiologic findings of intra-abdominal infection, such as
             perforated intraperitoneal abscess detected on: Computed tomography (CT) scan or
             Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Ultrasound (ii) Intra-operative/postoperative
             enrolment inclusion(in cases of postoperative enrolment, must be within 24 hours after
             the time of incision)::

             perforation occurs

          4. Traumatic perforation of the intestines, only if operated on &gt;12 hours after
             perforation occurs

          5. Secondary peritonitis (but not spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associated with
             cirrhosis and chronic ascites)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             drug, except in proven resistant organisms and/or worsening of the clinical condition
             for more than 24 hours. More than 2 consecutive doses are not permitted if the
             individual doses are expected to give &gt;12 hours' cover (ie, giving a total cover of
             &gt;24 hours.) For patients enrolled after a surgical procedure, only 1 dose of non study
