      To evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on hepatic blood flow (HBF) and hepatic arterial
      buffer response (HABR) in infants with obstructive jaundice by Doppler ultrasound.Twenty-five
      infants with biliary atresia (1-3 months-of-age) scheduled for a Kasai procedure were
      enrolled. portal vein blood flow (PBF), hepatic arterial blood flow (HABF) and hepatic blood
      flow (HBF) were measured by Doppler ultrasound before induction, and after inhalation of 2
      and 3% sevoflurane.

      Children suffering from hepatobiliary disease also have an hepatic arterial buffer response
      (HABR) with reduced portal vein blood flow (PBF) and compensatory increases in hepatic
      arterial blood flow (HABF) which can help maintain hepatic blood flow (HBF). For infants with
      obstructive hepatobiliary disease, reduced HBF may affect drug metabolism and increase the
      risk of respiratory depression during analgesia, which can be life-threatening.

    <description>Twenty-five infants diagnosed with Biliary Atresia and undergoing surgery were included in the study (age range 1-3 months). Inclusion criteria were persistent yellow skin or sclera, pale stool (in severe cases, clay-like), and hepatomegaly; increased serum bilirubin (progressively or no decline after increase), increased total bilirubin (TBil) dominated by increased direct bilirubin (DBil) (&gt;60%); elevated liver enzymes; ultrasound confirmation of poor gallbladder filling and signs of liver fibrosis; with radionuclide imaging confirmation of obstructed biliary excretion. Infants were excluded if they had concomitant cardiovascular or abdominal organ malformations.</description>
