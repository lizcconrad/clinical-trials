    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in
      HIV-infected adults who are virologically suppressed and who are on antiretroviral therapy
      (ART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ruxolitinib is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      myelofibrosis, a disorder in which bone marrow is replaced by scar (fibrosis) tissue. Many of
      the cytokines affected by myelofibrosis are also affected by HIV. Because of this,
      ruxolitinib may also be a possible treatment for HIV. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in HIV-infected adults who are on ART and
      who are virologically suppressed. Researchers will evaluate the effect ruxolitinib has on
      inflammation and immune activation.

      This study will enroll HIV-infected adults who are on select ART regimens and who have viral
      suppression. ART will not be provided by the study; participants will continue to receive ART
      from their own health care providers. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either ruxolitinib (Arm A) or no study treatment (Arm B). Participants in Arm A will receive
      ruxolitinib twice a day for 5 weeks. All participants will attend study visits at entry (Day
      0) and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12. These visits will include physical examinations,
      clinical assessments, blood collection, adherence assessments, oral swab collection, and
      pregnancy testing for female participants. At Weeks 1 and 4, participants in Arm A will take
      part in pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, which will involve having blood drawn several times
      over 6 to 8 hours.

             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, or historical plasma HIV-1
             RNA viral load. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol.

             hospitalization within 60 days prior to entry

          -  Vaccinations (other than influenza) less than or equal to 45 days prior to the study

          -  Use of immunomodulators (e.g., interleukins, interferons, cyclosporine), systemic
             cytotoxic chemotherapy or investigational therapy less than or equal to 60 days prior

          -  Any current diagnosis or past history of a significant cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, neurological, neuropsychiatric,
             psychiatric, or other serious illness that, in the opinion of the investigator*, could
             constitute a risk when taking investigational product or could interfere with the
             interpretation of data or affect the participant's ability to participate in the
             study. Diagnoses that would lead to exclusion include, but are not limited to the
             following:

               -  CDC category C AIDS-indicator conditions

               -  NOTE A: Except HIV encephalopathy, HIV wasting, esophageal candidiasis, or
                  pneumocystis pneumonia without dissemination.

               -  NOTE B: List available: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00018871.htm

               -  Herpes zoster (dermatomal or non-dermatomal).

               -  NOTE C: A history of prior chickenpox is not exclusionary.

                  Sustained Virologic Response, which is an undetectable HCV-RNA at 12 weeks or
                  more after completing treatment measured by a sensitive, qualitative, or
                  quantitative HCV-RNA assay)

               -  Disseminated fungal infection of any type or duration that is not limited to
                  cutaneous or mucocutaneous surfaces

               -  A medical disorder that predisposes to bleeding

               -  *NOTE: If a site investigator is unsure of whether a history of a significant
                  medical or psychiatric condition should lead to participant exclusion, the
                  investigator should err on the side of safety if s/he believes that an active or
                  clinically resolved disorder may put the participant at risk from participation
                  in the study, influence the results of the study, or affect the participant's
                  ability to participate. If still uncertain, then the site should contact the
                  protocol team (actg.corea5336@fstrf.org) to assist in a determination.

          -  Change in the ART regimen within 12 weeks, inclusive, prior to study entry or intended
             modification of ART during the study. NOTE: Modifications of ART doses during the 12
             weeks prior to study entry are permitted. In addition, the change in formulation
             (e.g., from standard formulation to fixed-dose combination) is allowed within 12 weeks
             prior to study entry. A within class single drug substitution (e.g., switch from
             nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to darunavir) is allowed within 12 weeks
             prior to study entry, with the exception of a switch between any other NRTI to/from
             abacavir. No other changes in ART within the 12 weeks prior to study entry are
             permitted. However, participants need to be receiving (and tolerating) an allowable
             (for study purposes) ART regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  History of untreated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosed by tuberculin skin
             test or interferon gamma release assay. LTBI treatment would consist of 9 months of
             isoniazid or an equivalent therapy completed at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.
