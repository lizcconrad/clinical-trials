  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an arginine enriched oral nutritional supplement
      in the prevention of wound complications in the the wounds of patients post lower limb
      revascularization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical incisions are associated with a number of possible complications. The reported
      incidence of surgical site infections at the groin after vascular procedures is between 3%
      and 30%. This incidence is up to five times higher than the expected incidence of infection
      in clean cases. Risk factors for postoperative surgical site infection in patients undergoing
      vascular surgery may include age, co-morbidities, use of prosthetic grafts and repeat
      operations.

      A systematic review in 2011 concluded that arginine supplemented diets among perioperative
      patients were associated with a reduced rate of surgical infection and reduced overall length
      of hospital stay.

      The study aims are to determine if taking an oral nutritional supplement reduces the rate of
      wound complications post lower limb revascularization.

    <description>Patients randomised to the oral nutritional supplement group will continue their normal diet. In addition, this group will commence taking oral nutritional supplement twice daily 5 days prior to surgery and continued for 4 weeks post surgery. Intake of nutritional drink will be suspended during their fasting period prior to surgery and will commence once surgery is completed and group are able to tolerate food post surgery. Wound examination will take place at 1 and at 4 weeks post surgery by the tissue viability nurse specialist who will be blinded to the treatment. Patient adherence to the study protocol with the nutritional supplement regimen will be recorded daily by the patient for four the four weeks the supplement is provided.</description>
