  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Sensi-StopTM strips (Procter &amp;
      Gamble™) on the relief of dentinal hypersensitivity. In other words, do Sensi-StopTM strips
      (Procter &amp; Gamble™) reduce or eliminate cold sensitivity in teeth? In addition, the
      investigators will evaluate whether there is a difference in the Sensi-StopTM strip (Procter
      &amp; Gamble™) effectiveness when the product is placed by a dental professional compared to
      self-placement by the person with sensitive teeth. This product is not experimental.

      There are two groups in this research study: 1) The Self Applied group, and 2) the
      Professionally Applied group.

      Once it is determined that interested individuals qualify to participate in the study and
      have determined that they want to participate, the group that participants are in will be
      determined. The study has been designed to ensure that 66% of the study participants receives
      strips that contain the active ingredient and 33% of the subjects receive strips without the
      active ingredient. This means that there is a 1 out of 3 chance that participants will be
      assigned to receive the strip(s) without the active desensitizing ingredient. At the end of
      your 8-week participation, if it turns out that participants received the strips without the
      active ingredient, they will be offered a sample pack with two strips that contain the active
      desensitizing ingredient for them to use at home.

    <description>An analysis of covariance model was used to compare mean reduction in sensitivity scores (SAS and VRS) between groups at each post-treatment time point. A linear mixed effect model with group, time and baseline score as fixed effects and a random subject effect was used to compare the sensitivity outcomes between groups across time. The effect of location was also examined using this model.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presents in good general health with no allergies to commercial dental
             products and are currently not using any desensitizing agents.

          -  If participants are using desensitizing agent the participant must agree to not use
             any desensitizing agents in the 4 weeks leading up to the baseline data collection
             appointment and during the following 8 week length of the study.

          -  Patients with a history of having used Sensi-Stop Strips (Procter &amp; Gamble™) in the
             past will not be eligible to participate because it will not be possible to maintain
             blindness to the treatment that they receive.

          -  Patients will also have at least the following baseline measurements:

             i. Schiff Air Scale = equal to or greater than 1

        ii. Verbal Rating Scale = equal to or greater than 1

        iii. Recession= 1mm or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any dental pathology resulting in pain that could confound the study findings would
             render the patient ineligible: e.g. advanced dental decay, pulpitis, fractured teeth,
             fractured restorations, chipped teeth, cracked teeth, severe gingival inflammation,
             post-restorative sensitivity, marginal leakage, severe periodontal disease, as
             characterized by purulent exudate, generalized mobility, and/or severe recession.

          -  Also, if potential study subjects are not willing to agree to avoid the use of
             desensitizing and/or whitening products they will not be enrolled.

          -  Adults lacking in the ability to give consent will also be excluded.

        <title>Schiff Air Test: Mean Reduction in Sensitivity Between Groups</title>
        <description>An analysis of covariance model was used to compare mean reduction in sensitivity scores (SAS and VRS) between groups at each post-treatment time point. A linear mixed effect model with group, time and baseline score as fixed effects and a random subject effect was used to compare the sensitivity outcomes between groups across time. The effect of location was also examined using this model.

SAS V9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for analysis. The sample size of 20 participants per group was based on having 90% power to detect a one standard deviation difference between the DO-strip groups and the placebo group means using ANOVA with a 0.05 level of significance.</groups_desc>

          <description>Subjects will be randomized to either receive the Prof applied oxalate Crest Sensi-Stop strip (Procter &amp; Gamble™). The oxalate strip contains 3% dipotassium oxalate desensitizing gel. The placebo strip is blank. The strips will be placed by a licensed dental professional and will be in place for 10 minutes. Subjects will be instructed to not rinse their mouth, drink, eat or brush their teeth for 30 minutes after completion of the treatment.

          <title>Self-applied Oxalate</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to the Active Comparator Group will have the following intervention: Intervention: self-applied oxalate (Crest Sensi-Stop strip Procter &amp; Gamble™), which contains 3% dipotassium oxalate desensitizing gel. The strip will be placed by the participant, following the manufacturer's directions. The strip will be left in place for 10 minutes. Subjects will be instructed to not rinse their mouth, drink, eat or brush their teeth for 30 minutes after completion of the treatment.
Self applied oxalate: Subjects will apply the strips (Procter &amp; Gamble™), that contain the active ingredient, by themselves following the manufacturer's instructions.</description>
