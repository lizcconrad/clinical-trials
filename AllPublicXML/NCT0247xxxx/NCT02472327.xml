  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction after an unplanned cesarean section was studied and in the previous
      study it was noted that there were common themes that lead to patient dissatisfaction. The
      four common themes were: lack of trust regarding the indications for surgery, communication
      issues, loss of control, and fear during the situation. The purpose of this second phase of
      this study is to try and improve patient dissatisfaction by offering additional emotional
      support prior to the c/s with the hope of decreasing the trust issues toward physicians,
      decreasing the communication barriers, and decreasing the fear and loss of control. The
      additional emotional support that will be received prior to the cesarean section will be
      scripted based upon the findings of the investigators' prior study - the patient will be
      asked four questions and each question addresses the four themes that were noted in the
      previous study.

    <textblock>
      All patients admitted to the Labor and Delivery unit at Albany Medical College who are in
      labor or being evaluated for possible indicated delivery will receive information regarding
      the study. Those who consent to participation, if they are then determined to need a cesarean
      birth will be randomized into two groups. The first group will receive pre-operative
      counseling by the obstetrics resident who will be performing the cesarean, the second group
      will receive usual care. The counseling sheet was determined based upon the findings of a
      previous study done at this institution, and addresses four themes that were recurrent
      aspects of patient dissatisfaction after cesarean birth: poor communication, trust of
      physicians, loss of control, and fear of surgery.

      Two weeks after the cesarean section, patients participating in the study are called on the
      phone by one of the investigators. A patient satisfaction survey, using a Likert scale is
      administered. This investigator is blinded as to whether the patient has received the
      additional counseling or not. Comparison of these scores will be used to determine whether
      pre-operative counseling can reduce dissatisfaction in patients undergoing unplanned cesarean
      sections.
