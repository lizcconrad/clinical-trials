  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial is planned to study the effects of cannabis on dystonia and spasticity in
      children with neurological diseases. The clinical trial will include 40 children divided into
      two groups: children with spasticity and dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and children with
      spasticity and dystonia due to genetic neurodegenerative diseases. Each group will be
      randomly divided into two arms and will receive Avidekel cannabis oil 6-to-1 ratio of CBD to
      THC or enriched Avidekel cannabis oil 20-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC. During the study, various
      variables will be collected including: medication intake, spasticity, dystonia score, pain
      scale, restlessness scale, quality of life measures, safety tests, side effects, and an
      addiction test. The investigators hypothesize that cannabis consumption will reduce dystonia
      and spasticity in children with motor disability related to genetic neurodegenerative
      diseases and cerebral palsy and as a result improve motor function, non-motor functions and
      quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of two cannabis oils containing the main
      cannabinoid Δ9 -THC and CBD ratio of 1 to 6 and 1 to 20 (respectively), on spastic movement
      disorder and dystonia.

      40 children will be enrolled in this study and will be divided into 2 groups:

        1. Children with spasticity and dystonia due to cerebral palsy

        2. Children with spasticity and dystonia due to genetic neurodegenerative diseases

      Each group will be randomly divided into two groups:

      I. Active comparator: 6-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC oil II. Active comparator: 20-to-1 ratio of
      CBD to THC oil

      During the study the following variables will be collected:

        -  Consumption of drugs \ medication intake

        -  Spasticity grade measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale

        -  Dystonia grade measured using the Barry Albright Dystonia Scale

        -  Patient's subjective report about the severity of his/her spasticity and/or dystonia

        -  Pain scale

        -  Restlessness scale

        -  Quality of life measures: function, sleep, mood , appetite , weight

        -  Safety tests: liver function, renal function, blood tests (complete blood chemistry),
           blood pressure, pulse, ECG

        -  Side effects

        -  Addiction test

      The purposes of the study:

        1. Efficiency - examining the effect of cannabis on dystonia and spasticity.

        2. Examining the most effective cannabinoid ratio for the relief of dystonia and
           spasticity. (Δ9 -THC and CBD ratio of 1 to 6 or 1 to 20, respectively).

        3. Examining the effect of cannabis on quality of life measures (such as medication intake,
           mood, appetite, sleep).

        4. Safety: examination of side effects and unwanted effects of cannabis and its
           limitations.

      Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that cannabis consumption will reduce
      dystonia and spasticity symptoms in children with motor disability related to genetic
      neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral palsy and as a result improves motor function,
      non-motor function and quality of life.
