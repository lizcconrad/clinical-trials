      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) massage in
      arterial and venous circulation of the upper limb ipsilateral of women submitted after
      axillary lymphadenectomy breast cancer. Will be evaluated 30 volunteers aged between 40 and
      60 years, divided into 2 equal groups, submitted at MLD: Group 1 - volunteers who underwent
      surgery for breast cancer that have lymphedema, subject to manual lymphatic drainage without
      upper limb elevation; Group 2 - volunteers who underwent surgery for breast cancer that have
      lymphedema, subject to manual lymphatic drainage with the upper limb elevation to 30º. Data
      will be collected by ultrasound Doppler in vein and brachial artery before, after MLD,
      immediately after, and 30 minutes after therapeutic treatment, with and without elevation of
      30°, cross over delimitation, being made a therapy session for therapeutic use with and
      without elevation, with interval period (washout) for seven days. The order of treatment
      protocols will be randomized by simple raffle for each volunteer. The data within and between
      groups will be evaluated by a statistical test t student or ANOVA. Otherwise it will be used
      Kruskal-Wallis followed test by Dunn. Data processing will be performed by software and fixed
      the critical level of 5% (p&lt;0,05).
