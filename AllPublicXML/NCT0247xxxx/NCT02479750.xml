    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance of ColdZyme® mouth spray on prevention of common cold
      symptoms on experimentally induced rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection in healthy
      volunteers. Half of participants will receive ColdZyme® mouth spray while the other half will
      receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      88 subjects will be inoculated with rhinovirus 16 via the nasal route. The subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to ColdZyme® or placebo. Treatment (6 doses per day) will be applied for 11
      days from the day of inoculation. The subjects will visit the investigational clinic on 6
      occasions. During these visits the subjects will leave nasal (lavage) and pharyngeal (swab)
      samples for quantification of virus replication. All subjects will have a diary for scoring
      of cold symptoms.
