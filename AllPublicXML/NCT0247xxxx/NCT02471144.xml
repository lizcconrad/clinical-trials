    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (etanercept
      in single blinded arm) study in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to less than 18 years with
      severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Approximately 160 subjects aged 6 years to &lt;18 years will be
      enrolled, of which at least 30 will be 6 years to &lt;12 years old. It is expected that subjects
      will be enrolled at approximately 70 study sites worldwide.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (etanercept
      in single blinded arm) study in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to less than 18 years with
      severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Approximately 160 subjects aged 6 years to &lt;18 years will be
      enrolled, of which at least 30 will be 6 years to &lt;12 years old. It is expected that subjects
      will be enrolled at approximately 70 study sites worldwide.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of secukinumab versus placebo
      at Week 12, based on both PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response rates in children and
      adolescents aged 6 to less than 18 years with severe chronic plaque psoriasis who had
      inadequate control of symptoms with topical treatment, or failed to respond to or tolerate
      previous systemic treatment and/or UV therapy.

      The study will assess the long term safety and tolerability of secukinumab in this pediatric
      age group and will describe the efficacy and safety of secukinumab compared to etanercept.
      This study will provide efficacy and safety data to support the extension of label of
      secukinumab to include children and adolescents (6 years to &lt;18 years) with severe chronic
      plaque psoriasis

      Two age subgroups will be studied in a staggered approach within this clinical study: 12 to
      less than 18 years of age, and 6 to less than 12 years of age . Enrolment of children aged 6
      to less than 12 years will begin after a favorable recommendation by an independent external
      Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) who will review data of approximately 80 adolescents.
      Adolescents will continue to be recruited while the data from the first 80 subjects are being
      collected and analyzed.

      Subjects will be randomized using a 1:1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: secukinumab
      low dose, secukinumab high dose, etanercept or placebo. Subjects randomized to secukinumab
      treatment arms (high dose and low dose) will receive dose based on the weight category (&lt;25
      kg, 25 to &lt;50kg, ≥50 kg).

      The study consists of 5 periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), induction (of 12 weeks),
      maintenance (of 40 weeks), extension treatment epoch (open-label of 184 weeks) and post-
      treatment follow-up epoch (of 16 weeks).

      The primary objectiove of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of secukinumab (low and
      high dose) in pediatric subjects with severe chronic plaque psoriasis with respect to both
      PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (co-primary endpoints) at Week 12, compared to
      placebo

    <description>The CDLQI measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological disorders who are less than 18 years of age and it has been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The CDLQI is a simple, validated, self-administered 10-item questionnaire. The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., symptoms and feeling, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep and treatment). The questions are based on the preceding week to permit accurate recall. For the CDLQI, each question will be answered on a 4-point Likert scale scored from 0 to 3. Seven scores will be derived from the CDLQI: the total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <description>The CHAQ questionnaire is only done for children who in addition to psoriasis are also suffering from psoriatic arthirtis. The questionnaire is completed by parent or legal quardian. It consists of multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and other &quot;activities&quot;. The person completing the questionnaire chooses from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' to 'unable to do'. Additionnaly two visual analog scales (overal well being and pain of patient) must be performed.</description>
