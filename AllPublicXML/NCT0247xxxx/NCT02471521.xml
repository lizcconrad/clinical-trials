  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find an optimal inspiratory pressure to provide adequate
      tidal volume and prevent gastric insufflation in pediatric patients.

      The children under 5 years old are randomly assigned to muscle relaxation group and
      non-relaxation group. For muscle relaxation group, routine anesthesia induction is performed
      with muscle relaxant and mask ventilation is started by pressure-controlled mechanical
      ventilation. Gastric auscultation and abdominal ultrasonography are performed simultaneously
      during mask ventilation to detect inflow of air. Initial inspiratory airway pressure is 10
      cmH2O and increased gradually by 2 cmH2O until gastric insufflation is detected by either of
      two methods. Tracheal intubation is done after detection of gas.

      For non-relaxation group, mask ventilation is performed in a same manner, without muscle
      relaxant. After detection of gas by any of the two methods, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg is
      administered and tracheal intubation is performed.

      Respiratory rates are 25 per minutes in infants and 20 in children over 1 years old. Tidal
      volume and oxygen saturation are recorded during study period.
