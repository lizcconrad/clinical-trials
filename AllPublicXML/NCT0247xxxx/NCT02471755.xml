      This was a RCT pilot study to assess the efficacy of Electro-acupuncture for menopausal
      transition participants.90 patients were randomly assigned to electro-acupuncture or sham
      electro-acupuncture group with a ratio of 1:1.During the whole process,all participants,
      evaluators and statisticians apart from acupuncturists remained strictly blinded.The changes
      of average 24 h hot flash scores of week8 from baseline was set as primary outcome. With
      statistical power of 90%, and a two-sided Î± at 0.05, as well as a drop-out rate less than
      20%, sample size was estimated at 90 participants. Data analysis was based on ITT principles,
      and 89 participants were included in data analysis(1 participant didn't want to
      participate).According to methods of LOCF, missing data were imputed to fill any gaps
      according to the last visit. For comparison between baseline and treatment (average 24h hot
      flash scores, MRS, hormone levels), data was tested by the t test or nonparametric test; for
      comparison between two independent samples, data were tested with t test, nonparametric test
      or X2 test. P&lt;0.05 was regarded as statistically significance.

    <description>Every day during the 4th, 8th, 20th, and 32nd weeks, symptoms and specific times of hot flashes were recorded in hot flash diaries by the participants.Data from weeks 4, 20 and 32 were recorded as the second time frame.According to the severity categories suggested by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), hot flashes were assessed as mild, moderate, or severe. Hot flash scores are calculated as (hot flash frequency x severity)/7, with severity scores ranging from 1=mild 2=moderate to 3=severe.</description>

    <description>MRS(Menopause Rating Scale) was designed to measure MT symptoms and to explore the influences on life qualities in a standardized way. In MRS, symptoms such as impaired memory, depression, insomnia, sweating, hot flashes, nervousness, joints complaints, lack of concentration were evaluated and calculated in numbers to describe the situation of patient. Scores on MRS range from 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>The bilateral acupoints of EX-CA1, ST25, SP6 and RN4 were selected for the treatment program.After regular disinfection,adhesive pads were placed on surface of all these acupoints. For RN4, EX-CA1, ST25, needles (0.30*75mm) were inserted into the points vertically throughout the pads, skin, fat tissue, and abdominal muscles until the participant had feeling of pricking. For SP6, needles were inserted into the acupoint to a depth of 1 cun,accompanied by manipulation of lifting, thrusting, and twisting 3 times. Electronic stimulator was connected to EX-CA1 and ST25 with dilatational wave, 10/50HZ, 0.1 to 1.0mA. The current intensity was adjusted to abdomen shivering without pain. Treatment lasted for 30 minutes and acupuncture manipulation for RN4 and SP6 were performed every 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>Non-acupoints approximate to RN4, ST25, EX-CA1 and SP6 were selected bilaterally, and adhesive pads were placed on the surface of selected non-acupoints' location. Blunt needles were inserted into the pads and to touch, rather than penetrate the surface of skin. Meanwhile, like EA group, manipulations of lifting, thrusting and twisting on non-acupoint approximate to RN4 and SP6 were performed 3 times. Sham Electronic stimulator was applied to the non-acupoint approximate to EX-CA1 and ST25, providing the outward appearance of the procedure in EA group but with no current intensity actually applied. Any other interventions were rigorously maintained the same as in the EA group.</description>

        <description>Every day during the 4th, 8th, 20th, and 32nd weeks, symptoms and specific times of hot flashes were recorded in hot flash diaries by the participants.Data from weeks 4, 20 and 32 were recorded as the second time frame.According to the severity categories suggested by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), hot flashes were assessed as mild, moderate, or severe. Hot flash scores are calculated as (hot flash frequency x severity)/7, with severity scores ranging from 1=mild 2=moderate to 3=severe.</description>

            <description>Eelectro-acupuncture: The bilateral acupoints of EX-CA1, ST25, SP6 and RN4 were selected for the treatment program.After regular disinfection,adhesive pads were placed on surface of all these acupoints. For RN4, EX-CA1, ST25, needles (0.30*75mm) were inserted into the points vertically throughout the pads, skin, fat tissue, and abdominal muscles until the participant had feeling of pricking. For SP6, needles were inserted into the acupoint to a depth of 1 cun,accompanied by manipulation of lifting, thrusting, and twisting 3 times. Electronic stimulator was connected to EX-CA1 and ST25 with dilatational wave, 10/50HZ, 0.1 to 1.0mA. The current intensity was adjusted to abdomen shivering without pain. Treatment lasted for 30 minutes and acupuncture manipulation for RN4 and SP6 were performed every 10 minutes.</description>

Blunt needles were inserted into the pads and to touch, rather than penetrate the surface of skin. Meanwhile, like EA group, manipulations of lifting, thrusting and twisting on non-acupoint approximate to RN4 and SP6 were performed 3 times. Sham Electronic stimulator was applied to the non-acupoint approximate to EX-CA1 and ST25, providing the outward appearance of the procedure in EA group but with no current intensity actually applied. Any other interventions were rigorously maintained the same as in the EA group.</description>

        <title>Change of MRS (Menopause Rating Scale) From Baseline</title>
        <description>MRS(Menopause Rating Scale) was designed to measure MT symptoms and to explore the influences on life qualities in a standardized way. In MRS, symptoms such as impaired memory, depression, insomnia, sweating, hot flashes, nervousness, joints complaints, lack of concentration were evaluated and calculated in numbers to describe the situation of patient. Scores on MRS range from 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

For RN4, EX-CA1, ST25, needles (0.30*75mm) were inserted into the points vertically throughout the pads, skin, fat tissue, and abdominal muscles until the participant had feeling of pricking. For SP6, needles were inserted into the acupoint to a depth of 1 cun,accompanied by manipulation of lifting, thrusting, and twisting 3 times. Electronic stimulator was connected to EX-CA1 and ST25 with dilatational wave, 10/50HZ, 0.1 to 1.0mA. The current intensity was adjusted to abdomen shivering without pain. Treatment lasted for 30 minutes and acupuncture manipulation for RN4 and SP6 were performed every 10 minutes.</description>

        <description>Serum sample of participants was examined at the 2nd to 4th day of menstrual period; if the participant was not in menstrual period, Serum sample would be tested in coming cycle length; for participants in menopause period, Serum sample was examined at the end of the week of 8th and 20th.</description>

            <description>Eelectro-acupuncture: The bilateral acupoints of EX-CA1, ST25, SP6 and RN4 were selected for the treatment program.After regular disinfection,adhesive pads were placed on surface of all these acupoints. For RN4, EX-CA1, ST25, needles (0.30*75mm) were inserted into the points vertically throughout the pads, skin, fat tissue, and abdominal muscles until the participant had feeling of pricking. For SP6, needles were inserted into the acupoint to a depth of 1 cun,accompanied by manipulation of lifting, thrusting, and twisting 3 times. Electronic stimulator was connected to EX-CA1 and ST25 with dilatational wave, 10/50HZ, 0.1 to 1.0mA. The current intensity was adjusted to abdomen shivering without pain. Treatment lasted for 30 minutes and acupuncture manipulation for RN4 and SP6 were performed every 10 minutes.</description>

            <description>Sham Eelectro-acupuncture: Non-acupoints approximate to RN4, ST25, EX-CA1 and SP6 were selected bilaterally, and adhesive pads were placed on the surface of selected non-acupointsâ location. Blunt needles were inserted into the pads and to touch, rather than penetrate the surface of skin. Meanwhile, like EA group, manipulations of lifting, thrusting and twisting on non-acupoint approximate to RN4 and SP6 were performed 3 times. Sham Electronic stimulator was applied to the non-acupoint approximate to EX-CA1 and ST25, providing the outward appearance of the procedure in EA group but with no current intensity actually applied. Any other interventions were rigorously maintained the same as in the EA group.</description>
