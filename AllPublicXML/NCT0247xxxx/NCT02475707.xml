    <textblock>
      This research study uses special blood cells called multiple tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA)-specific T cells (a new experimental therapy) to treat patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which has come back, or may come back, or has not gone away
      after standard treatment, including an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      The investigators have previously used this sort of therapy to treat Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas that are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes infectious
      mononucleosis (&quot;mono&quot; or the &quot;kissing disease&quot;), Epstein Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found in
      cancer cells of up to half of all patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This
      suggests that it may play a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are
      able to hide from the body's immune system and escape being killed. The investigators
      previously tested whether special white blood cells (called T cells) that were trained to
      kill EBV-infected cells could affect these tumors, and in many patients the investigators
      found that giving these trained T cells caused a complete or partial response.

      In several lymphomas and other types of cancers like ALL, the cancer cells do not have EBV.
      They do however express specific proteins that can be targeted in the same way. The
      investigators have been able to infuse such tumor-targeted cells into up to 10 patients with
      lymphoma who do not have EBV, and seen some complete responses. Importantly, the treatment
      appears to be safe. Therefore, the investigators now want to test whether the investigators
      can direct these special T cells against other types of cancers that carry similar proteins
      called tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These proteins are specific to the leukemia cell, so
      they either do not show up, or show up in low quantities, on normal human cells.

      The investigators will grow T cells from patients' stem cell donors in the laboratory in a
      way that will train them to recognize the tumor proteins WT1, PRAME and Survivin, which are
      expressed on most ALL cancer cells. The cells will be infused at least 30 days
      post-allogeneic stem cell transplant. In this study, the investigators want to see whether
      these cells will be able to recognize and kill leukemia cells that express these antigens.
      These donor-derived multiTAA-specific T cells are an investigational product not yet approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of donor-derived multiTAA-specific
      T cells for patients with ALL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make donor-derived multiTAA-specific T cells, the investigators will collect blood from
      the patient's stem cell donor, and mix the donor's T cells with small pieces of the tumor
      proteins WT1, PRAME and Survivin. These protein fragments stimulate the donor T cells to grow
      and react against these proteins in such a way that they will recognize and kill cancer cells
      that express these proteins. Once sufficient numbers of multiTAA-specific T cells have been
      made, the investigators test them to make sure they target the patient's cancer cells, but
      not their normal healthy cells.

      The multiTAA-specific T cells will be administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion over
      10 minutes. The patient's cancer will be assessed within 4 weeks prior to the T cell
      infusion, at 4-6 weeks, and again at 8-12 weeks after the infusion. If at least 4 weeks after
      the infusion there is no change or a reduction in the number of cancer cells measured in the
      bone marrow, or a decline in cancer-specific markers in the blood, patients may receive up to
      six (6) additional doses of the T cells at least 4 weeks apart. All of the treatments will be
      given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist Hospital or Texas
      Children's Hospital.

      For at least 4 weeks after the infusion, patients may not receive any other anti-cancer
      treatments, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy, with the exception of drugs like
      dasatinib. Patients who do receive any other therapies will be taken off treatment, and will
      not be able to receive additional doses of T cells.

      This is a dose escalation study, which means that at the beginning, patients will be started
      on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of T cells. Once that dose level proves safe,
      the next group of patients will be started at the next highest dose. This process will
      continue until all 3 dose levels have been studied. If side-effects are too severe, the dose
      will be lowered or the T cell injections will be stopped.

      Before being treated, patients will undergo a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam.

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.

        -  Measurement of ALL (done by a bone marrow biopsy or blood tests).

        -  Pregnancy test, if patient is a female who can have children.

      Patients will undergo standard medical tests both during the T cell infusions and after:

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.

        -  Measurement of disease 4-6 weeks and 8-12 weeks after the T cell infusion (done by bone
           marrow biopsy or blood tests).

      Active participation in this study will last for approximately one (1) year. If the patient
      receives additional doses of the T cells as described above, their active participation will
      last until one (1) year after the last dose of T cells. We will then contact the patient once
      a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) in order to evaluate disease
      response long-term.
