  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, part of a larger research project (The Retornus Study), is aimed to evaluate new
      strategies to optimize rehabilitation outcomes in dysphagic stroke patients. Main objective
      is to assess effectiveness of neuromuscular electroestimulation (NMES) in combination with
      respiratory muscle training (RMT) in the treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia in subacute
      stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is present in a significant proportion of subacute stroke patients (up to 85%,
      depending on the series) and is associated with an increase in medical complications such as
      bronchoaspirative pneumoniae which is responsible for approximately half of the deaths that
      occur in these patients. Besides, the risk of pneumonia in patients with dysphagia is three
      times higher compared to those patients without. Since there is no drug able to restore the
      swallowing and respiratory muscle function, neurological rehabilitation apperars to be as the
      mainstay of treatment of these disorders.

      Respiratory muscle weakness is common after stroke, but how it contributes in the development
      of bronchoaspiration pneumonia is not well determined. In acute phases of stroke, the
      mechanism seems to be more related to an impaired central drive than the reduction of
      strength in respiratory muscle.

      Otherwise, the NMES aims to improve muscle strength. The NMES accelerates swallowing recovery
      since it induces brain reorganitzation after stroke through sensory and motor stimulation of
      peripheral nerves, mainly in swallowing aerea.

    <description>Videofluoroscopy swallow assessment with the 8-point Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS): PAS score of 1 indicates a normal test, scores from 2 to 5 indicate passage of material into the larynx that does not pass below the vocal folds (penetration) and scores from 6 to 8 indicate passage of material below the level of vocal folds (aspiration)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal respiratory muscle strength is assessed through maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (PImax and PEmax, respectively) measured at the mouth. To determine respiratory pressures, patients were urged to perform a maximum inspiration from residual volume against an occluded airway and a maximum expiratory effort from total lung capacity.</description>
