  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, open, prospective, non-interventional, multicenter trial for previously
      treated adult participants with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). Eligible
      participants with FL will receive 6-8 infusions of induction standard regimen of rituximab
      plus chemotherapy. Participants with complete or partial remission at end of induction will
      be assigned to maintenance therapy with rituximab once every 3 months for a maximum of 2
      years or until relapse. The choice of the treatment regimen will be established on a per
      center basis, according to the standard in use in the country and in the center, and each
      center will use the same regimen through the study. Participants will be followed up for
      safety and efficacy evaluation in accordance with routine practice.

    <description>Lymphoma response was assessed using Cheson criteria. Objective response was defined as having either complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR). Criteria for CR (target lesions): Nodes returned to normal (if greatest transverse diameter [GTD] greater than [&gt;] 15 millimeters [mm] before therapy, GTD now less than or equal to [≤] 15 mm; if GTD 11-15 mm and short axis [SA] &gt;10 mm before therapy, SA now ≤10 mm) and all (non-nodal) target lesions completely resolved. Criteria for CR (non-target lesions): All non-target lymph nodes returned to normal size, all extra-nodal lesions have completely resolved, liver and spleen have returned to normal size (if enlarged at baseline). Criteria for PR: Sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of target lesions decreased at least 50 percent (%) from baseline and spleen and liver nodules regressed by 50% in SPD or single lesion in GTD.</description>
