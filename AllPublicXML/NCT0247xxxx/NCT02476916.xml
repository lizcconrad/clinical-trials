    <textblock>
      Study AG348-C-003 is a multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      different dose levels of AG-348 in patients with PK deficiency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label, two arm, multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging study during
      which adult patients with PK deficiency will receive multiple doses of AG-348 for up to 24
      weeks (Core Period); eligible patients may enter an Extension Period to receive AG-348 for up
      to 4 additional years. Data will be reviewed on a regular basis and study design, dose and
      schedule will be adapted based on these reviews. The study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of multiple doses of AG-348, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
      profile of AG-348 and early indicators of clinical efficacy.

    <description>Participants with PK deficiency received AG-348, 50 milligrams (mg), twice daily for the Core Period (Week 24). At the Week 24 visit, Core Period participants who had safely tolerated AG-348 and demonstrated clinical activity in response to AG-348 were potentially eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment. Participants were assigned to initial doses (50 or 300mg) and were treated across a range of doses due to treatment emergent AEs and Hb levels exceeding mid-point of sex-adjusted ranges.</description>
