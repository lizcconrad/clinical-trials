  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn disease (CD) is an idiopathic, chronic, relapsing and remitting inflammatory condition
      of the gastrointestinal tract with a high risk for complications and need for surgical
      interventions, particularly in children. Immunomodulators and biologic therapies are
      effective at inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric CD, yet there is no proven
      strategy for reducing exposure to medications once sustained remission has been achieved.
      Diet has been proven to impact disease activity in CD and may allow for sustained drug-free
      remission. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether pediatric CD patients
      in long-standing remission remain in remission longer after stopping medications if they
      follow the Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED). The hypothesis is that subjects on the CDED
      will have longer time-to-relapse as opposed to those on an unrestricted diet.
