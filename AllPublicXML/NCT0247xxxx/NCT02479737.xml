  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative bleeding is a common consequence after heart surgery which can significantly
      impact outcomes and costs [Wynne R, Christensen MC, Dixon B]. When bleeding occurs, reliable
      postoperative blood evacuation of the pleural, mediastinal and pericardial spaces with chest
      tubes is imperative to facilitate pulmonary re-expansion and mediastinal decompression as the
      patient recovers. When postoperative blood evacuation is inadequate, retained blood
      complications can result (herein described as the Retained Blood Complications (RBC). RBC is
      the presence of post-operative pericardial and/or pleural fluid or blood that is diagnosed
      and may necessitate drainage in the acute or sub-acute setting. The need for treatment and
      interventions for these conditions represents an impediment to patient recovery and involves
      both resource and economic consumption for a heart program and the healthcare system at
      large.

      Clinically, Retained Blood Complications (RBC) can be recognized acutely or subacutely. When
      it presents acutely, it is usually fresh thrombus around the heart or lungs presenting as
      tamponade or hemothorax. When it presents subacutely, it results in bloody pleural or
      pericardial effusions. These effusions are often driven by the breakdown of remaining
      thrombus. Once RBC occurs, subsequent procedures may be needed to remedy it.

      A recent review of the literature indicated that additional procedures for RBC are
      demonstrated in approximately 15% to 20% of patients after heart surgery. In a prospectively
      collected United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 2010, RBC could be
      demonstrated in 17% of patients. In this analysis, mortality was doubled from 4% to 8%,
      length of stay was increased by 5 days, and average costs were 55% higher. Patients with RBC,
      therefore, represent an increased at risk population for complications and costs.

      Postoperative obstruction of conventional chest tubes with blood and other fibrinous material
      in the setting of postoperative bleeding contributes to RBC. (Shalli) In a recent study of
      postoperative cardiac surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic, 36% of patients were found to
      have evidence of chest tube obstruction . Active Clearance with PleuraFlow has been shown to
      prevent chest tube clogging, and reduce RBC.

      Complications from RBS are defined as those requiring re-operation or surgical interventions
      to evacuate blood, blood clot, bloody fluid, and air accumulation within the operative site
      after closure of the surgical wound. This is a prospective multicenter observational
      post-market study with a retrospective component. The study is open to up to five (5) German
      sites enrolling a consecutive cohort of cardiac surgery patients.

      There are two conditions for participation in this registry. First, sites are required to
      enter into the study database anonymized matched historical data elements from a cohort of
      cardiac surgery patients done over the preceding 12 to 24-month period (Phase 0). These
      retrospective data elements will be used as baseline information for the purpose of
      comparative analyses with the prospective data sets. Second, sites that have not been using
      the PleuraFlow System before enrolling patients to this study are required to participate in
      a roll-in phase (Phase 1). The purposes of the roll-in phase are to allow the users at
      participating sites to familiarize themselves with the product use and with ACT, to implement
      Clinical Use Protocols provided by ClearFlow, Inc. to all commercial users as part of product
      training, and to demonstrate consistency and compliance with the clinical use protocols.
