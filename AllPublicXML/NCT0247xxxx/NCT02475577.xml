  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test a hypothesis that the remote monitoring with text and email alerts sent
      to study subject and optional family/other caregiver (Intervention 1) will have a higher
      return on investment compared to remote monitoring with nurse researcher follow-up telephone
      communication to study subject (on Blue alerts) or study subject's healthcare professional
      (on Red alerts) (Intervention 2) and self-monitoring without intervention (Control).

      The objective of this remote monitoring study is to evaluate return on investment and
      end-user clinical outcomes associated with the use of self-monitoring peripherals and
      tablet/smartphone-based Welch Allyn HealthInterlink technology without intervention
      (Control), HealthInterlink remote monitoring with text and email alerts sent to study subject
      and optional family/other caregiver (Intervention 1), and HealthInterlink remote monitoring
      with nurse research assistant follow-up telephone communication to study subject (on Blue
      alerts) or study subject's healthcare professional (on Red alerts) (Intervention 2 added to
      Intervention 1).
