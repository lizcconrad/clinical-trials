  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that hemolytic diseases predispose patients to the development of
      pigment gallstones. Gallstones are noted in at least 5% of children under the age of 10
      years, increasing to 40-50% in the second to fifth decades. The co-inheritance of Gilbert's
      syndrome increases the risk of cholelithiasis four to five-fold.

      In patients with chronic hemolysis, total bile lipid concentration is decreased and the total
      bilirubin to total lipid ratio is increased. This suggests that the conjugating capacity of
      hepatocytes is surpassed by the excessive amount of bilirubin resulting from hemolysis.
      Increased bilirubin monoconjugate and unconjugated bilirubin can precipitate in bile and form
      complexes with inorganic ions, mostly calcium, and develop into stones.

      Patients with hemolytic disorders can also develop biliary sludge, a suspension of
      precipitated particulate matter in bile dispersed in a viscous, mucin-rich liquid phase . The
      chemical composition of the precipitates correlates well with the composition of the
      associated stone and sludge often stands as a harbinger of future stone development.

      There is strong data suggesting a benefit in treating cholelithiasis with UDCA and also in
      preventing gallstone development in various high risk scenarios.

      There are several proposed mechanisms for the positive effect of UDCA in primary prevention
      of pigment stones. Mucoglycoproteins are present in significant amounts in black pigment
      stones and contribute to the matrix of gallstones. UDCA suppresses the secretion of protein
      and decreases the levels of various proteins in bile . It has also been suggested that
      increased colonic bile salt may solubilize unconjugated bilirubin and may prevent calcium
      complexing.

      There is no published data at present on the role of UDCA in prevention and treatment of
      cholelithiasis in hemolytic diseases. The investigators hypothesise that UDCA can be of
      benefit to patients with hemolytic disorders in the primary prevention of pigment stones,
      possible resolution of biliary sludge and existent stones, and reduction of symptomatic
      episodes of cholelithiasis.

      The research protocol extends for up to 12 months, during which the participant will attend 3
      clinic visits at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre; one at study enrollment, one at 6 months and
      one at 12 months.

      All patients identified will have their medical records reviewed for previous clinical,
      biochemical or sonographic evidence of gallstones.

      Patients will undergo a baseline abdominal ultrasound to assess for biliary sludge,
      gallstones, or evidence of previous cholecystitis (eg. Thickened gallbladder wall).

      All patients will also have blood tested for liver biochemistry, complete blood count,
      hemolytic screen and fasting lipids.

      Participants will be commenced on UDCA 15mg/kg/day (maximum dose 900mg/day) in 2-3 divided
      doses for 12 months.

      Patients who are unable to tolerate tablet medication will be started on UDCA syrup at the
      same dose.

      Each of the in-house visits will include:

        1. An explicit history taking and review of patient's notes, including review of symptoms,
           blood tests and previous ultrasounds, other medical conditions and medications.

        2. Physical examination - including measuring splenic size, assessing for right upper
           quadrant abdominal tenderness

        3. Blood tests

             1. Hemoglobin, WBC

             2. Liver biochemistry: ALT, AST, GGT, ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase), Bilirubin
                (conjugated and unconjugated), Albumin

             3. Hemolytic screen: LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocytes

             4. Fasting lipids: LDL, HDL, Triglycerides

      Repeat abdominal ultrasound will be performed at 12 months. The US will specifically relate
      to the following features in comparison to the baseline US:

        1. Presence of biliary sludge

        2. Presence of gallstone: i.Size ii.Number

        3. Presence of bile duct dilatation

        4. Presence of gall bladder wall thickening
