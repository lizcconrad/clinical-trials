  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kappa-opioid receptors mediate the sensation of itch in animals and humans. Asimadoline is an
      orally active, selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist and has demonstrated efficacy in
      several preclinical pruritus models. The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of asimadoline in patients with pruritus
      associated with atopic dermatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asimadoline has been administered to over 1900 human subjects or patients in clinical trials
      and exhibits an acceptable safety profile. Due to its high selectivity for the kappa-opioid
      receptor, asimadoline does not produce mu-opioid like side-effects. Results from preclinical
      models indicate asimadoline significantly reduces the frequency of scratching induced by
      pruritic agents. This double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study is designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of asimadoline in patients with pruritus
      associated with atopic dermatitis.
