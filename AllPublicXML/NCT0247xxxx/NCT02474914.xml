  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard operation for treatment of patients with benign
      and malignant pancreatic and periampullary diseases. Despite improved surgical technique and
      postoperative care, the mortality rate after PD is high reaching up to 30%, due to high
      incidence of postoperative complications . Pancreatic fistula (PF) is the one of the most
      frequent complications of PD and the major contributor to postoperative morbidity The aim of
      this study to evaluate the effect of the perioperative octreotide use after PD for prevention
      of the postoperative pancreatic fistula. The secondary outcomes are overall postoperative
      complications, mortality and the cost benefit relationship of the use of the perioperative
      octreotide.

      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial for perioperative use of
      octreotide in patients after PD for pancreatic and periampullary tumours from May 2014 to
      April 2017 in Gastroenterology surgical center, Mansoura University, Egypt.

      The primary outcome of the study is the effect of perioperative use of octreotide on the rate
      of development of postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients after PD for pancreatic and
      periampullary tumours. The secondary outcome is postoperative overall complications,
      mortality, duration of the hospital length of stay and cost-benefit relationship of
      perioperative use of octreotide.

      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either the octreotide or the placebo group. The
      randomization process will be done using closed envelop method and will be withdrawn by a
      nurse after pancreaticoduodenectomy . Patients in the octreotide group will receive
      sandostatin 100ug SC every 8 hours daily staring from the day of operation to the
      postoperative day 7. Patients in the placebo group will receive saline administered in a
      similar manner.

    <description>POPF was defined by International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) as any volume of drained fluid on or after postoperative day (POD) 3 with amylase content greater than 3 times the serum amylase activity . POPF was graded into Grade A, B, and C according to the clinical course</description>

    <description>Delayed gastric emptying was defined as output from a nasogastric tube of greater than 500 ml per day that persisted beyond 10th POD, the failure to maintain oral intake by 14th POD, or reinsertion of a nasogastric tube. Biliary leak was defined as the presence of bile in the drainage fluid that persists to 4th POD</description>
