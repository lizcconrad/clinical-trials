  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the pharmacokinetic profile (i.e. the way the product is
      processed by the body) of a proprietary curcumin formulation compared to an unformulated
      curcumin product. Subjects will take a single dose of either the proprietary formulation or
      comparator product and the blood levels of curcumin and curcumin metabolites will be measured
      over a period of 48 hours.
