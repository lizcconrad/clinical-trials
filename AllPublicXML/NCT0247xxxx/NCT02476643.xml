      This study aims to test, if a two-week integrative therapy in an internal medicine ward will
      improve symptoms, disability and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      or irritable bowel syndrome.a It shall further be tested, if those changes are associated
      with attitudes and experiences towards complementary and alternative medicine, anxiety,
      depression and stress perception as well as body awareness and responsiveness.
