      The purpose of this study is to compare the use of chlorhexidine-gel-impregnated dressing and
      the transparent polyurethane film dressing as coverage of the site of insertion of central
      venous catheter, in the evaluation of catheter colonization in critically ill adults
      patients.

    <measure>Catheter Colonization</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from placement until the withdraw of the central venous catheter, an expected average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>With aseptic technique, the central venous catheter will be withdrawn and a 5 centimeters distal portion of the catheter will be cut and conditioned in sterile test tube and sent to the microbiology laboratory. It will be considered a Catheter Colonization a significant growth of one or more microorganism in a semiquantitative culture of the catheter tip. It is according to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and management of Intravascular Catheter- Related Infection: 2009 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America</description>

    <measure>Microbiological Exit site Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from placement until the withdraw of central venous catheter, an expected average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>With aseptic technique, a swab will be collected before removal of central venous catheter, the swab will be moistened with sterile saline and rolled for about 2 cm around the exit site. The material will be conditioned in sterile test tube and sent to the microbiology laboratory. It will be considered a Microbiological Exit Site Infection the exudate at catheter exit site yields a microorganism.
