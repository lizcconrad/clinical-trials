      AbsorbISR is a randomized, controlled trial, single center, prospective, not blinded to
      evaluate two strategies of in stent restenosis treatment: Implantation of drug eluting
      bioresorbable stent scaffold Absorb® vs. balloon angioplasty with drug eluting balloon
      Sequent Please®.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is randomized-controlled trial of Absorb® Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) vs.
      Sequent Please® drug coated balloon in an all-comers population with in-stent-restenosis
      (ISR). The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion and the investigators intend to
      include 150 patients.

      All patients presenting with ISR and requiring percutaneous coronary intervention will be
      eligible to be included in this study. This will include patients with stable angina and
      those presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of the Absorb®
      bioresorbable scaffold compared to the Sequent Please® Drug Coated Balloon when treating
      patients with In-Stent-Restenosis regards to primary endpoint - angiographic late lumen loss
      at 9 month follow-up.

  <why_stopped>
    Information of other studies with Abseb bioresorbable scaffolds showed a higher thrombotic risk
    than before, the risk for the Patients is estimated too high
