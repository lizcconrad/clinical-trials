    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-063. TAK-063 is being tested to treat
      people who have schizophrenia. This study will look at the different symptoms associated with
      schizophrenia including cognitive symptoms, personal and social functioning and functional
      capacity (ability to perform tasks associated with real, everyday life such as household
      chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities) in
      people who take TAK-063.

      The study enrolled 164 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groupsâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-063 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets once daily at nighttime. All participants
      will initially receive TAK-063, 20 mg/day. The dose may be titrated down to 10 mg/day, if
      intolerable.

      The multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 6 weeks. Participants will be hospitalized until the Week 3
      visit. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic during the treatment and 1 visit during
      the follow-up.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician rated scale designed to assess global severity of illness. CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. A participant is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Score at Weeks 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>BACS is specifically designed to measure treatment- related improvements in cognition and includes alternate forms. The battery of tests in the BACS includes brief assessments of reasoning and problem solving, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory, and motor speed. The primary measure from each test of the BACS is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1. A composite score was calculated by averaging all of the 6 standardized primary measures from the BACS, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. The composite z-score indicates how much higher or lower the participant's cognition is compared to a healthy person. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) Score at Weeks 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The BNSS is a13-item instrument designed for use in clinical trials and other studies that measures 5 domains of negative symptoms: blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition. All the items in the BNSS are rated on a 7-point (0-6) scale, with anchor points generally ranging from the symptom's being absent (0) to severe (6). A scale total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; total score range of 0 to 78, where higher score indicates higher severity of negative symptoms. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score at Weeks 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale is a clinician-reported outcome instrument that was developed to evaluate social and personal functioning. It measures 4 domains of social functioning: socially useful activities including work and study, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. The clinician assigns an initial 6-degree of severity to each area (absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe or very severe). The final result is a single assessment of social functioning ranging from 0 (no autonomy) to 100 (excellent functioning). Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment - Brief Version (UPSA-B) at Week 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSA-B evaluates the abilities of individuals to perform everyday tasks that are considered necessary for independent functioning in the community. The UPSA-B uses role playing situations to evaluate skills in 5 areas: household chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities. Subscale scores range from 0 to 20 points, and total scores range from 0 to 100 points; higher scores reflect better performance. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 6</title>
        <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Positive subscale consists of 7 items which assesses the positive symptoms with subscale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity. Negative subscale consists of 7 items which assesses the negative symptoms with subscale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity. General psychopathology subscale consists of 16 items which assesses the general symptoms of schizophrenia with subscale score ranging from 16 to 96, where higher score indicates greater severity. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Clinical responders based on the PANSS total score is defined as at least 30% improvement from baseline in the total score. PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S is a clinician rated scale designed to assess global severity of illness. CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. A participant is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression Scale â€“ Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6</title>
        <description>The CGI-I assesses the participantâ€™s improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess the participantâ€™s condition relative to baseline on a 7-point scale. CGI-I scale assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening) on a 7-point scale: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. Least square mean and standard error values were calculated using a MMRM.</description>

        <description>Responder based on CGI-I is defined as a rating of much improved or very much improved. The CGI-I assesses the participantâ€™s improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess the participantâ€™s condition relative to baseline on a 7-point scale: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Score at Weeks 3 and 6</title>
        <description>BACS is specifically designed to measure treatment- related improvements in cognition and includes alternate forms. The battery of tests in the BACS includes brief assessments of reasoning and problem solving, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory, and motor speed. The primary measure from each test of the BACS is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1. A composite score was calculated by averaging all of the 6 standardized primary measures from the BACS, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. The composite z-score indicates how much higher or lower the participantâ€™s cognition is compared to a healthy person. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM.</description>

        <description>The BNSS is a13-item instrument designed for use in clinical trials and other studies that measures 5 domains of negative symptoms: blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition. All the items in the BNSS are rated on a 7-point (0â€“6) scale, with anchor points generally ranging from the symptomâ€™s being absent (0) to severe (6). A scale total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; total score range of 0 to 78, where higher score indicates higher severity of negative symptoms. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The PSP scale is a clinician-reported outcome instrument that was developed to evaluate social and personal functioning. It measures 4 domains of social functioning: socially useful activities including work and study, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. The clinician assigns an initial 6-degree of severity to each area (absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe or very severe). The final result is a single assessment of social functioning ranging from 0 (no autonomy) to 100 (excellent functioning). Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment â€“ Brief Version (UPSA-B) at Week 3 and 6</title>
        <description>The UPSA-B evaluates the abilities of individuals to perform everyday tasks that are considered necessary for independent functioning in the community. The UPSA-B uses role playing situations to evaluate skills in 5 areas: household chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities. Subscale scores range from 0 to 20 points, and total scores range from 0 to 100 points; higher scores reflect better performance. Least square mean and standard error values were determined using a MMRM. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
