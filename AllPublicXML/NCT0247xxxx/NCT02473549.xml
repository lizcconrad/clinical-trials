  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals are often left with problems moving their arm and hand, months to even years
      after a stroke. Recent progress in research suggests the application of non-invasive brain
      stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), in conjunction with
      rehabilitation exercises can further improve a person's ability to move after stroke.
      However, the problem is that this doesn't work for everyone, and researchers do not know why.
      One reason may be that TDCS is currently applied using a one-size-fits-all approach.
      Researchers apply the same type of TDCS to everyone, assuming the stroke affects everyone in
      the same way. But, researchers know this is not the case. For example, each person will
      likely have different amounts of damage to brain regions that control movements. A better
      understanding of how the stroke uniquely affects a person's brain will help us to know which
      is the correct type of TDCS to apply for that person. Therefore, the objective of this
      research is to determine whether the amount of damage to brain regions that control movements
      can predict which type of TDCS will be more effective to help a person improve their ability
      to move. Participants will undergo 1 session of magnetic resonance imaging, and three
      sessions of TDCS.
