  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if dimethyl fumarate (DMF) causes changes
      in the abundance and diversity of commensal microbiota. The secondary objectives of this
      study are as follows: To identify if there are differences in the gut microbiota composition
      between patients that do or do not develop gastro intestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), both
      pre- and post DMF treatment and to examine if the resolution of GI AEs in DMF treated
      patients is reflected in the gut microbiota.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gut microbiota composition between DMF treated participants that do or do not develop GI AEs as measured by an increase in the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Week 2, Week 12 and/or upon occurrence of GI symptoms outside of designated time points</time_frame>
    <description>GSRS is a self-reported questionnaire regarding GI symptoms comprising 15 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale. The 15 items can be grouped in 5 dimensions 1) abdominal pain (abdominal pain, gastric hunger pain, and nausea) 2) reflux (heartburn and acid regurgitation) 3) indigestion (borborygmus, bloating, eructation, and increased flatus) 4) diarrhea (diarrhea, loose stools, and urgency) and 5) constipation (constipation, hard stools, incomplete evacuation). A GI AE will be defined as an at least 2 point (&gt;=2) increase from baseline in total score of any of the 5 dimensions in the GSRS.</description>
