  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mayo Clinic psychiatric pharmacogenomic team has developed a pharmacogenomic algorithm
      that has been designed to improve the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant medications
      by providing guidance in medication selection and appropriate dosing. This algorithm has been
      incorporated into a new genotyping interpretative report. This report is now available from
      AssureRx. The pharmacogenomic algorithm is based on genotyping both copies of four
      informative genes. These four genes are: 1) the Cytochrome P450 2D6 gene; 2) the Cytochrome
      P450 2C19 gene; 3) the Serotonin Transporter gene (SLC6A4); and 4) the Serotonin 2A receptor
      gene (5HTR2A). Though this algorithm is not yet part of the universal standard of care, Mayo
      clinicians have found it helpful in guiding treatment decisions at Mayo Clinic Rochester.

      The proposed pilot study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of the interpretive
      report in an outpatient behavioral health clinic in St. Paul, Minnesota. While the ultimate
      goal of this project is to show an improvement in patient outcomes, this pilot study will be
      used to evaluate the feasibility of introducing the pharmacogenomic algorithm to a new
      setting that does not routinely use the algorithm. Secondary outcome data will be collected
      to generate meaningful estimates of the magnitude of potential treatment effects. The study
      will consist of two phases, each enrolling 2530 subjects. In Phase 1, consecutive patients
      will be prospectively monitored to observe standard practice. Patients will be given the
      option to receive genotyping and those that agree will have blood drawn. However, the results
      of the genotyping and algorithm will not be released until all phase 1 patients have
      completed study visits.. Subsequently, in Phase 2, also enrolling 3025 subjects, the results
      of the genotyping and algorithm will be made available immediately for additional consecutive
      prospectively monitored patients. Patients will be prospectively monitored in the same
      fashion as Phase 1. The results of the study will be used to perform preliminary analyses and
      subsequent fully powered multi-site trials will be planned based on the results of this
      study.
