  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rebound acid hypersecretion (RAHS), defined as an increase in gastric acid secretion above
      pre-treatment levels after PPIs therapy is observed within two weeks after withdrawal of
      treatment and could theoretically lead to acid-related symptoms such as heartburn, acid
      regurgitation, or dyspepsia that might result in resumption of therapy. A plausible
      physiologic theory for the rebound phenomenon suggests that long-term, elevated gastric pH
      caused by blockage of the proton-pumps stimulates compensatory gastrin release.
      Interestingly, Reimer et al. demonstrated the occurrence of RAHS in healthy volunteers who
      had received eight weeks of esomperazole. The clinical symptoms occured in a different
      prevalence compared with placebo treated patients at ten weeks after withdrawal and until the
      end of the study (twelve weeks). Twenty to twenty-two percent of patients displayed symptoms
      ten or twelve weeks after having discontinued PPIs while they occured in 1.7-7% of
      placebo-treated patients. Efforts should be pursued to restrict PPI therapy use to patients
      likely to benefit from it.

      In this context, we propose to investigate the benefit of a progressive decrease in doses of
      esomeprazole compared to a sudden discontinuation. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with 156 patients treated by esomeprazole 40mg since four weeks
      least, randomized to one week of placebo or one week of esomeprazole 20mg. We want to compare
      the prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms between patients with progressive
      discontinuation (one week of esomeprazole, 20mg, then discontinuation) or those with sudden
      discontinuation of esomeprazole 40mg.

    <description>The five-item PASS test is a valid tool for the evaluation of persistent acid-related symptoms in patients receiving PPI therapy. It demonstrates good content validity, test-retest reliability, responsiveness and construct validity in both English and French forms. The PASS test is a simple, clinically applicable tool for the identification of patients with persistent acid-related symptoms during therapy and the assessment of their responses to a change in therapy.
The investigators will modifiy the first question for the study. While, it is usually asked: &quot; Are you taking prescription medication for any of the following stomach problems/symptoms:… &quot; ; in the study, the investigators will ask : &quot; Do you have any of the following stomach problems/symptoms : … &quot;.
