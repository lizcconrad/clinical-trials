  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial in patients with AR.
      After a one-week run-in period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to the Tian Jiu
      group, placebo-control group and waitlist-control group. The TJ and placebo-control groups
      will undergo a 4-week treatment with one session per week and one 4-week post-treatment
      follow-up. Participants in the waitlist-control group will not receive any treatment during
      the first 4 weeks but will be required to be assessed. The total study period will be nine
      weeks.
