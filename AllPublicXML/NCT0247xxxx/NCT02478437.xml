  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine whether cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) on the
      medial branch nerves of the lumbar facet joint is effective for the treatment of low back
      pain. CRFA blocks the nerves that carry pain signals from joints in the lower back such that
      the brain does not receive the message that the low back is in pain. This technique is
      commonly performed by burning these nerves rather freezing them, but it is suspected that
      freezing them results in better pain relief. The CRFA blocks has been shown to effectively
      treat sacroiliac joint pain (a joint in the pelvis), which is another reason that it is
      suspected that CRFA will be effective when treating pain related to facet joints in the low
      back. We are performing this study in order to determine if that is the case.
