  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative potency of multiple oral doses of LUM001
      and SHP626 administered for 7 days as assessed by fecal bile acid excretion in overweight and
      obese adult subjects. This study is designed to address the relative potency question for the
      first time in the same.

             evidence of any active or chronic disease (see Section 7.2.2.1 for details and
             exceptions) following the completion of a detailed medical and surgical history, a
             complete physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, hematology, blood chemistry,

             (140 lbs at the first screening visit). This inclusion criterion will only be assessed
             at the first screening visit.

          7. All clinical laboratory parameters are within normal laboratory limit or not found to
             be clinically significant by the principal investigator.

          8. Ability to swallow a dose(s) of investigational product(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any hematological, hepatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal,
             neurological, or psychiatric disease, gall bladder removal, or current or recurrent
             disease that could affect the action, absorption, or disposition of the
             investigational product, or clinical or laboratory assessments.

          2. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
             that may require treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study,
             or any condition that presents undue risk from the investigational product or
             procedures.

          3. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product(s),
             closely-related compounds, or any of the stated ingredients.

          4. Significant illness, as judged by the investigator, within 2 weeks prior to the first
             dose of investigational product.

          5. Known history of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year.

          6. Donation of blood or blood products (eg, plasma or platelets) within 60 days prior to
             receiving the first dose of investigational product.

          7. Within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product:

               -  Have used an investigational product (if elimination half-life is &lt;6 days,
                  otherwise 5 half-lives).

               -  Have been enrolled in a clinical study (including vaccine studies) that, in the
                  investigator's opinion, may impact this Shire-sponsored study.

               -  Have had any substantial changes in eating habits or exercise routine, as
                  assessed by the investigator

          8. Confirmed resting systolic blood pressure &gt;145 mmHg or &lt;89 mmHg, and diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;95 mmHg or &lt;59 mmHg.

          9. Twelve-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;460 milliseconds for male subjects or &gt;470
             milliseconds for female subjects at screening. If QTc exceeds 460 milliseconds for
             males or 470 milliseconds for females, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the
             average of the 3 QTc values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility

         10. A positive screen for drugs of abuse at screening or at Day -3 (check-in).

         11. Male subjects who consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week or 3 units per day.
             Female subjects who consume more than 14 units of alcohol per week or 2 units per day.

             alcohol).

         12. A positive HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             antibody screen.

         13. Use of tobacco (eg, smoking or chewing) or other nicotine-containing products (eg,
             gum, patch) in any form. Ex-users must report that they have stopped using tobacco for
             at least 30 days prior to receiving the first dose of investigational product.

         14. Routine consumption of more than 2 units of caffeine per day or subjects who
             experience caffeine withdrawal headaches. (One caffeine unit is contained in the

             12 oz cup of tea, and three 1 oz [85 g] chocolate bars. Decaffeinated coffee, tea, and
             cola are not considered to contain caffeine.)

         15. Prior screen failure, randomization, participation, or enrollment in this study. If a
             subject has successfully completed a study using LUM001 or SHP626, they may
             participate in this study providing at least 30 days has passed since their last dose

             required during the study.

         18. Colonoscopy, barium enema, or other tests that require a bowel cleansing within 4
             weeks prior to the first dose of investigational product.

         19. Subjects who report typically having less than 3 bowel movements per week or greater
             than 3 bowel movements per day.

         20. Use of antibiotics within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product.
