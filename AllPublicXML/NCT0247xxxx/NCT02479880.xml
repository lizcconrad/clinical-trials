  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the long term (ie, 96 weeks of follow
      up) bone safety profile of open-label tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) treatment
      in CHB-infected adolescents. This includes prospectively evaluating and comparing the bone
      mineral density (BMD) change between CHB-infected adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years of age treated
      with tenofovir DF in European treatment centers who are assigned to one of two schedules for
      renal and bone laboratory monitoring and BMD measurement.
