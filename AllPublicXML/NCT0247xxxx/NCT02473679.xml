  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest occurs frequently and the outcome after out-of-hospital resuscitation is often
      fatal. Disturbing is that more than half of the surviving patients suffer from permanent
      impairment of cognitive functions, such attention, memory and executive functioning. With all
      the efforts to achieve a high quality initial resuscitation management the time delay between
      cardiac arrest and the beginning the initial resuscitation maneuver is the main reason for
      the still poor outcome. To shorten this fatal time delay, current efforts of national and
      supranational health authorities aime at the non-medically trained lay person, who should
      carry out basic life support directly on the scene supported by the use of public available
      semi-automatic defibrillators (AED).

      It is a combined retrospective and prospective observational single center study. Data of all
      Out of Hospital patients suffered a cardiac arrest in Zurich city will be collected according
      to the Utstein criteria. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of trained police
      forces in the resuscitation outcome.
