      A novel interactive exoskeleton robotic system with embedded force and motion sensors will be
      developed to facilitate walking of stroke patients with hemiparesis. The robot will
      synchronise with the gait pattern of the stroke patient to provide assistance in ankle
      dorsiflexion during swing phase. It is hypothesised that the robot can facilitate stable and
      longer walking distance for stroke patients with drop foot problem. It can be applied on
      unilateral side, which is suitable for stroke patients with hemiparesis. The whole system
      design is lightweight, compact, comfortable, and user-friendly in hospital or at home
      settings.

      In this clinical trial, participated stroke patients will be divided into two groups: Robotic
      group and Sham group. Stroke patients in both groups will participate in a 20-session gait
      training program, which includes overground walking and stair climbing exercises. Robotic
      group will walk with the powered Ankle Robot, which provide ankle dorsiflexion support during
      swing phase of walking; Sham group will walk with the Ankle Robot with very low assistance
      level, which provide only tactile feedback but no ankle support in order to evaluate the
      placebo effect. A series of clinical assessments will be carried out to assess the functional
      recovery in stroke patients before and after the gait training program.

    <description>Stroke patients will enrol in a 20-session gait training program for at least two sessions per week. In each session, the stroke patient will walk overground continuously for 2 * 10 minutes and walk up/down a staircase (about 10 steps per flight) for 10 minutes, rest will be provided in between each round of walking or stair climbing. This training can promote gait recovery and physical fitness.
They will wear the Ankle Robot during the gait training. The motor will synchronise with the paretic-side gait pattern to provide dorsiflexion moment during swing phase, and free the ankle joint when the sole is loaded.</description>
