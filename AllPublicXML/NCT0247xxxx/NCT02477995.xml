  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus are seriously infectious diseases in children. Since using
      of the adsorption diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis (DTwP), it greatly reduced
      incidence of the three kinds of diseases. But the thallus of pertussis in the vaccine may
      cause more side reactions after vaccination. Since 2000, the basic immunization DTwP vaccine
      has been replaced by adsorption tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine in American.
      In 1995, DTaP was successfully developed in China, and have been used in EPI at present.
      Because of effective immunity and little side reaction, DTaP has been widely recognized and
      accepted by the parents.

    <textblock>
      Pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus are seriously infectious diseases for children. The world
      health organization (WHO) included the adsorption diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis
      (DTwP) into the expanded program on immunization (EPI), as a basic immunization. Since using
      the DTwP, it greatly reduced incidence of the three kinds of diseases. Thousands of children
      have been saved since its application. Although the DTwP was productively in against
      pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, thallus of pertussis in the vaccine could cause more side
      reactions after vaccination. Many individuals did not want to be vaccinated. However, there
      was two large epidemics of pertussis during the period of 1977-1979 and 1981-1983. Since
      2000, the basic immunization DTwP vaccine has been replaced by adsorption
      tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) vaccine in American. In 1995, DTaP was
      successful developed in the investigators' country, and is used in EPI at present. Because of
      effective immunity and causing little side reaction, DTaP has been widely recognized and
      accepted by the parents. This clinical trial is planning to evaluate the immunogenicity and
      safety of DTaP in 3-5 months infants .
