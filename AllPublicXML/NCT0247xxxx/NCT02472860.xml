  <brief_summary>

      The investigators will conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of a computerized
      intervention targeting cognition in 30 teens with autism spectrum disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the limited options for treatments to improve the core symptoms of autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD), strategies that could target secondary features of the condition and improve
      quality of life for affected individuals are critical. Neuroplasticity-based cognitive
      training has been found to improve cognition in youth with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) and in adults with schizophrenia. In this trial, the investigators are
      seeking to extend the relevance of computerized cognitive training to youth with ASD. Given
      the literature, the investigators hypothesize that computerized cognitive training will
      produce gains in untrained cognitive tasks and behavioral ratings of executive functions in
      youth with ASD. The investigators will assess aspects of attention and executive functions in
      30 affected youth and randomize them 1:1 to either neuroplasticity based cognitive tests or
      enjoyable age-appropriate computer games not intended to improve cognition. Cognition will be
      assessed again after 15 hours of training over 6 weeks and then again at a three month follow
      up.
