      Recent breakthroughs in antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention provide new opportunities to
      rethink HIV prevention and treatment strategies, especially for key populations such as
      Female Sex Workers (FSWs). Antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention of HIV transmission has the
      potential to have a profound population-level impact on the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
      Several recently completed randomized controlled trials of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis
      (PrEP) have shown efficacy at reducing HIV acquisition in high-risk populations. How to
      translate these trial results into population-level effects is the next critical step. PrEP
      &quot;demonstration&quot; projects, in collaboration with local stakeholders and at sites of routine
      care for high-risk populations provide an opportunity to move promising research results into
      actual public health benefits. With these key features in mind, the investigators propose an
      HIV PrEP demonstration project in FSW in Dakar, Senegal, West Africa. The objective of the
      proposed demonstration project with Tenofovir DF/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) among Female Sex
      Workers (FSW) in Dakar Senegal is to build a sustainable HIV PrEP program for FSW in Dakar,
      Senegal while demonstrating the feasibility of providing daily oral PrEP with Truvada
      (TDF/FTC) for 12 months to the enrolled FSW at Ministry of Heath run clinics (Pikine, Mbao,
      Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers). Critical milestones for this demonstration project
      with be feasibility, uptake, acceptability, use of TDF/FTC PrEP and programmatic retention of
      FSWs in Dakar MoH clinics. The investigators have assembled an expert team from RARS,The
      University of Washington, and Westat that have had greater than 2 decades of collaboration on
      HIV related projects in FSWs in Senegal. The investigators expect the results of this project
      will show that Senegal provides a unique opportunity to assess acceptability, feasibility,
      uptake and effectiveness of oral HIV PrEP at reducing HIV transmission in a high-risk FSW
      population.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a two-phase study, consisting of the following:

      PHASE I - The feasibility evaluation for this study will take several forms.

        -  Observations - Field-based assessment of service delivery at each of the five sites;

        -  In-depth interviews - With policymakers, program managers, and service providers, as
           well as other community members and leaders; and

        -  Focus groups with registered and unregistered female sex workers (FSW). PHASE II - This
           will be a prospective demonstration study of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with
           Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/TDF) for FSW with 12 months of follow
           up and a 3-month accrual period. A total of 267 FSW will be enrolled.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Build a sustainable HIV PrEP program for FSW in Dakar, Senegal.

        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of providing daily oral PrEP with FTC/TDF for 12 months to
           FSW at Ministry of Health (MoH)-run clinics in Pikine, Mbao, Rufisque and Diamniadio
           Health Centers) in Dakar.

      POPULATION &amp; SAMPLE SIZE

      PHASE I:

        -  10 Key Informants: Policymakers, program managers, and service providers, as well as
           other community members and leaders.

        -  Focus Group Participants: 8 Registered and 8 Unregistered HIV-negative FSW age 18 or
           older.

      PHASE II:

      • 267 HIV-negative FSW age 18 or older recruited from four public health centers in Dakar:
      Pikine, Mbao, Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers.

      PROTOCOL EVALUATIONS

        -  PHASE I: Qualitative data from observations, key informant interviews, and focus groups
           will be collected, analyzed and used to inform the implementation of Phase II.

        -  PHASE II: Quantitative data will be collected using behavioral measures and clinical and
           laboratory evaluations. Data from electronic monitoring will also be collected.

      STUDY DURATION 24 months

      REGIMEN Daily oral PrEP with FTC/TDF for 12 months
