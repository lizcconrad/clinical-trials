      Objective of study is to explore expression of stress-related genes and inflammation in
      placentas and umbilical cord blood for women participating in group prenatal care compared
      with women receiving individual prenatal care.

      This study aims to evaluate levels of inflammatory markers and genetic indicators of stress
      an inflammation in the placentas and umbilical cord blood in pregnancies that undergo group
      prenatal care as compared to traditional prenatal care. The investigators know that women
      receiving group prenatal care have fewer spontaneous preterm deliveries. What is not known is
      the mechanism behind this difference. By collecting umbilical cord blood samples and
      placentas of 40 women at the time of delivery, the investigators hope to study expression of
      stress-related genes and levels of inflammatory markers at the maternal-fetal interface.
