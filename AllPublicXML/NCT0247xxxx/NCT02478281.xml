      This is an open-label, single-center, one-arm, safety, tolerability, and PK study in healthy
      male and female volunteers of Methylene Blue Injection, USP. Following an overnight fast,
      twelve healthy adult male and female volunteers will receive a single dose of study drug at a
      dose of 1 mg/kg solution per kg given intravenously over a period of 5 minutes followed by
      serial venous blood sampling at 0.042, 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,
      16, 36, 48, and 72 hours postdose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male or female volunteers, 18-60 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Weigh at least 52 kg for males and 45 kg for females and within the normal range
             according to accepted normal values of the Body Mass Index (BMI) chart 18.5-29.9 kg/m²
             inclusive.

          -  Medically healthy with no clinically significant laboratory profiles, vital signs, or
             ECG's; as deemed by the PI.

          -  For females of childbearing potential: either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14
             days prior to the first dose and throughout the study or be using acceptable birth
             control methods. Female subjects who claim to be sexually inactive, but become
             sexually active during the course of the study must agree to use a barrier method
             (e.g. condom, diaphragm)with spermicide from the time of the start of sexual activity
             through at least 30 days following dosing. In addition, female subjects of
             childbearing potential will be advised to remain sexually inactive or to keep the same
             birth control method for at least 30 days following dosing.

          -  Females of non-childbearing potential must have undergone one of the following
             sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to Day 1:

               -  Hysteroscopic tubal ligation (with a copy of the confirmation test) and be using
                  a barrier method (condom or diaphragm) and spermicide throughout the study;

               -  Bilateral tubal ligation and be using a barrier method (condom or diaphragm) and
                  spermicide throughout the study;

               -  Hysterectomy;

               -  Bilateral oophorectomy or be postmenopausal with amenorrhea for at least 1 year

                  Females on hormone replacement therapy may be deemed eligible for participation
                  in the study even if their FSH levels &lt; 40 mIU/mL, if they are able to provide
                  documentation of FSH levels 40 mIU/mL before initiation of hormone replacement
                  therapy.

          -  Males must use condom with spermicide when engaged in sexual activity and must agree
             to refrain from sperm donation from check-in through 90 days postdose.

          -  Have been on a special diet (for whatever reason) within the 28 days prior to study
             drug dosing, and throughout the study.
