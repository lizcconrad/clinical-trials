  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the value of infusing BHB in type 1 diabetic subjects
      during experimentally induced hypoglycemic episode in conjunction with testing of cognitive
      function. This will lay the basis for subsequent trials exploring the novel use of
      therapeutic doses of oral ketone formulations that are currently under commercial
      development, which could serve as adjunct therapies to protect the brain from hypoglycemia in
      type 1 diabetic subjects experiencing recurrent hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy controls as well as type 1 diabetic subjects will undergo a
      hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp with concomitant BHB or saline (control) infusion in
      random order. During each experimental condition the participants will complete a battery of
      validated cognitive tests that are sensitive to the cognitive impairment typically caused by
      hypoglycemia.

    <description>Subjects will undergo a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp with a target glucose level of 55mg/dl. Once a stable glycemic state is reached, subjects will receive a bolus-continuous infusion beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) or infusion of a comparable volume of normal saline (placebo) to control for possible volume effects for the remainder of the study. Throughout the BHB or saline infusion cognitive function will be tested via a standardized testing battery.</description>
