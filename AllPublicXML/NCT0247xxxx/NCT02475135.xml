  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of
      Emtricitabine (FTC) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) when administered as a fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) with darunavir (DRV) and cobicistat (COBI)
      (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) relative to
      administration as an FDC with Elvitegravir (EVG) and COBI
      (Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), under fed conditions in
      healthy subjects (Panel 1); evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and relative
      bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF when administered as an FDC (D/C/F/TAF) or as
      separate agents (D+C+FTC/TAF), under fed conditions in healthy subjects (Panel 2) and to
      evaluate the impact of food (fasting or high-fat breakfast) on the single-dose
      pharmacokinetics of DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF when administered as an FDC (D/C/F/TAF) in
      healthy subjects (Panel 3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, 3-panel, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy
      subjects. Healthy subjects will be divided over 3 panels (Panel 1, 2 and 3). Subjects will be
      randomized within each panel. In each panel, during 2 subsequent sessions, each subject will
      receive 2 treatments (Treatments A and B in Panel 1, Treatments C and D in Panel 2, and
      Treatments E and F in Panel 3). Each treatment is defined as follows: Treatment A: single
      oral dose of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 milligram (mg) as FDC tablet under fed conditions
      (standardized regular breakfast); Treatment B: single oral dose of E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10
      mg as FDC tablet under fed conditions; Treatment C: single oral dose of D/C/F/TAF
      800/150/200/10 mg as FDC tablet under fed conditions; Treatment D: single oral dose of DRV as
      800-mg tablet, FTC/TAF as 200/10 mg tablet and COBI 150 mg tablet under fed conditions.
      Treatment E: single oral dose of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg as FDC tablet, under fasted
      condition and Treatment F: single oral dose of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg tablet, with a
      standardized high-fat breakfast. Each treatment will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 days. Primarily pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed. Subjects' safety will be
      assessed throughout.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be a non-smoker for at least 3 months prior to selection

          -  Subject must have a body mass index (BMI, weight in kg divided by the square of height
             in meters) of 18.5 to 30.0 kg/m^2, extremes included

          -  Subject must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital
             signs, and 12-lead ECG performed at screening. If the results are outside the normal
             reference ranges, the subject may be included only if they are not listed under the
             exclusion criteria and if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from
             normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the
             subject's source documents and initialed by the Investigator

          -  Subject must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             screening. If the results of the biochemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are
             outside the normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only if the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal are not listed in the exclusion criteria, and
             the Investigator judges they are not clinically significant. This determination must
             be recorded in the subject's source documents and initialed by the Investigator

          -  Subject must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

             screening

          -  Subject has hepatitis A, B, or C infection (confirmed by a positive hepatitis A
             antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM), hepatitis B surface antigen, and/or hepatitis C virus
             antibody, respectively) at screening

          -  Subject has currently significant and active diarrhea, nausea, or constipation that in
             the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability

          -  Subject has any history of renal insufficiency

          -  Subject has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to DRV, COBI (GS-9350),
             EVG (Panel 1 only), FTC, TAF or their excipients
