      This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of
      MDX (1400 mg daily) for 10 weeks compared with placebo in adults with ADHD.

      The study will be comprised of Screening, Washout (if required), Treatment (total of 10
      weeks) and Follow-up periods. Approximately 750 patients will be enrolled and undergo initial
      eligibility assessments.

      -  A 10-week randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of
           MDX (1400 mg daily) for 10 weeks compared with placebo in adults with ADHD.

        -  The study will be comprised of Screening, Washout (if required), Treatment (total of 10
           weeks) and Follow-up periods. Approximately 750 patients will be enrolled and undergo
           initial eligibility assessments.

        -  Subjects requiring a washout will undergo a Washout period where ADHD medication is
           discontinued (21 days for atomoxetine, 14 days for other ADHD medications). These
           subjects will have an Interim Visit (off drug) on or about Day -10 (Day -10 to Day -3)
           for CAARS-Inv assessment at the end of the Washout period.

        -  Subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo/MDX for a total treatment duration of up
           to ten weeks.

      There will be a one week Follow-up period after the last dose of study treatment or early
      termination.

             has previously participated in a trial with MDX.

         12. Subject has any condition that, in the principal investigator's opinion, would place
             the subject at risk or influence the conduct of the study or interpretation of
             results, including (but not limited to) abnormally low intellectual capacity as judged
             by the investigator.

         13. Subject cannot fully comprehend the implications of the protocol, cannot comply with
