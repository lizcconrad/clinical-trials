  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has set a plan to replace
      trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) with bivalent OPV (bOPV) plus inactivated polio vaccine
      (IPV) in routine immunization globally, to be instituted in 2015-2016. At the community
      level, the impact of the change from tOPV + IPV to bOPV + IPV on Sabin virus fecal-oral
      transmission (duration of circulation, degree of genetic reversion) and the persistence of
      environmental contamination are unknown. Also unknown is the impact of the change from tOPV
      to bOPV on community circulation of Sabin 2 after a special immunization (SI) activity with
      monovalent oral poliovirus type 2 (mOPV2). Finally it is unknown at the level of an
      individual child if type 2 fecal shedding will be limited by cross-protection from oral
      vaccination with Sabin type 1 and 3.

      The investigators propose to measure at a community level transmission of Sabin 2 virus in
      Bangladesh, a low income country, where fecal-oral transmission and environmental exposures
      are high, comparing transmission in the setting of vaccination with tOPV+IPV vs. bOPV+IPV.
      The study will be conducted in 67 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, using a cluster-randomized
      study design. Villages in Matlab will be randomly assigned to receive as part of routine
      immunization (RI) activities: (1) tOPV (6,10,14 weeks) plus IPV at 14 weeks; (2) bOPV (6,10,
      14 weeks) plus IPV at 14 weeks; or (3) bOPV (6,10, 14 weeks) plus IPV at 14 and 18 weeks.
      Community and environmental surveillance for Sabin 2 virus will be conducted in each village
      over the 9 month period of these RI activities. In addition, a SI activity with mOPV2 will
      occur 9 months into the study to model an outbreak response. For the 6 months following the
      mOPV2 challenge, the impact of the different vaccination regimens on Sabin 2 transmission in
      the community will be determined, as well as individual level protection (as measured by
      fecal shedding from days 7-70 after mOPV2 challenge).
