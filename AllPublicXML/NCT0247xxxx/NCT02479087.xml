  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the role of a FVIII/VWF complex concentrate (Emoclot)
      in successfully inducing immune tolerance (I.T.I.) in patients with Haemophilia A with
      inhibitors, including patients at high risk of failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of factor VIII inhibitors occurs in approximately 30 to 40% of patients with
      severe Haemophilia A. The main negative clinical and cost consequence is the ineffectiveness
      of replacement therapy in patients with high-titer antibodies, who have a shorter life and
      greater morbidity than those who do not develop inhibitors. It is known from immunology that
      a regular and frequent exposure to the antigen of FVIII can induce tolerance of the immune
      system of the patient with inhibitors. This effect, called &quot;immune tolerance induction&quot; (ITI)
      is usually achieved after a prolonged exposure of the patient to FVIII, and is a common way
      of managing the condition of patients with inhibitors as well as the treatment of bleeding
      episodes with large amounts of hemostatic agents. In vitro and retrospective clinical studies
      suggest that FVIII/VWF complex concentrates may have less immunogenicity with respect to
      those plasma-derived concentrates purified with monoclonal antibodies (MABs), and recombinant
      DNA factor VIII concentrates (rFVIII), in both which the von Willebrand factor (VWF) is
      absent. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) showed to be effective in about 70% of Haemophiliacs
      with inhibitors. Poor prognosis factors have been identified by different registries: age ≥ 6
      years, ITI started &gt;1 year from inhibitor development, inhibitor peaks &gt;200 BU, inhibitor
      titer &gt;10 BU at the start of ITI and previously failed ITI. The results of clinical studies
      suggest that complex concentrates of VWF/FVIII can be effective in ITI, even in patients at
      high risk of failure. To explain these findings, a role for VWF (i.e. prolonged antigen
      exposure) has been hypothesized.

This implies that 9 months represents the minimum period of treatment and 33 months the maximum possible duration of ITI without success, OR patient withdrawal from the study for any reason.</description>

    <description>The drug will be delivered through intravenous slow infusion/injection. The starting dosage can vary between the minimum dosage of 50 IU/Kg 3 times a week up to a maximum of 200 IU/kg per day.
This starting dosage will be decided by the Principal Investigator according to patient's condition and other variables.
The initial dosage can be then adjusted on the base of response.</description>

    <description>The investigational treatment is with lyophilized plasma-derived Factor VIII. The product belongs to the factor VIII concentrates class, containing also VW Factor in an average ratio VW/VIII of &gt; 1: 4.5.
The product is as a powder and a solvent solution for continuous infusion of Factor VIII. The specific activity of Factor VIII is of approximately 80 IU/mg protein.
The number of units of FVIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are consistent with current WHO standards for products containing Factor VIII. The activity of Factor VIII in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (compared to normal human plasma) or in International Units (compared to the international standard for FVIII in plasma).</description>
