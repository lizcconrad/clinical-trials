      The purpose of this study is to collect serum samples to evaluate serologic assays and to
      establish proficiency panels for serologic assays used for assessment of post vaccination
      immune response after intramuscular (IM) vaccination with Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent
      virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine.

      The vaccine being tested in this study is called Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent Virus-Like
      Particle Vaccine (NoV Vaccine). The purpose of this study is to collect serum samples to
      evaluate serologic assays and to establish proficiency panels for serologic assays used for
      assessment of post vaccination immune response after intramuscular (IM) vaccination with the
      NoV vaccine. The validation and proficiency testing of the immunogenicity assays is required
      to support the NoV Vaccine development program. This study also looked at side effects in
      people who were administered a single dose of the NoV vaccine.

      The study enrolled 50 patients. All participants received one dose of the NoV vaccine via
      intramuscular injection.

      Participants were asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the
      injection site in a diary card for 7 days after receiving the vaccination.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was 183 days. Participants made 4 visits to the clinic, and were contacted by
      telephone 183 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Solicited Local (Injection Site) Adverse Events (AEs) by Maximum Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessment included collection of solicited local AEs for 7 days following vaccination (including the day of vaccination) by using diary cards. Solicited local injection site AEs are defined as pain, erythema (redness), induration and swelling. Pain is summarized as either none or any, where 'any' will be broken down into the following severity categories: mild, moderate, severe. Erythema, swelling and induration are recorded as yes or no, where the definition of 'yes' is any area ≥2.5 cm; and 'yes' is further broken down into the following severity categories: ≥2.5 cm - ≤5.0 cm (mild intensity), &gt;5.0 cm - ≤ 10.0 cm (moderate intensity), &gt;10.0 cm severe intensity). Injection site AEs are presented as the percentage of participants experiencing a reaction, by reaction type, overall and by severity, using the participant's worst reported severity grade. Only categories for which there was at least 1 participant are reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Solicited Systemic Adverse Events (AEs) by Maximum Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessment included collection of solicited systemic AEs for 7 days following vaccination (including the day of vaccination) by using diary cards. Solicited systemic AEs are defined as headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, vomiting and diarrhea and are summarized as either none or any, where 'any' will be broken down into the following severity categories: mild, moderate, severe. Solicited systemic AEs are presented as the percentage of participants experiencing a solicited systemic AE, by AE, overall and by severity, using the participant's worst reported severity grade. Only categories for which there was at least 1 participant are reported.</description>

    <description>Safety assessment included measurement of body temperature for 7 days following vaccination (including the day of vaccination) by using diary cards. Participants recorded the highest body temperature observed each day in a daily diary. The highest body temperature measurement per participant across Day 1 to Day 7 was categorized as fever present (≥100.4ºF, ≥38ºC) or fever absent (&lt;100.4ºF, &lt;38ºC).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) by Maximum Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 28</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Unsolicited AEs are any AEs that are not solicited local or systemic AEs, as defined by this study. Unsolicited AEs are presented as the percentage of participants experiencing at least one AE, overall and by severity, using the participant's worst reported severity grade. Only categories for which there was at least 1 participant are reported.</description>

        <description>Safety assessment included collection of solicited local AEs for 7 days following vaccination (including the day of vaccination) by using diary cards. Solicited local injection site AEs are defined as pain, erythema (redness), induration and swelling. Pain is summarized as either none or any, where ‘any’ will be broken down into the following severity categories: mild, moderate, severe. Erythema, swelling and induration are recorded as yes or no, where the definition of ‘yes’ is any area ≥2.5 cm; and ‘yes’ is further broken down into the following severity categories: ≥2.5 cm - ≤5.0 cm (mild intensity), &gt;5.0 cm - ≤ 10.0 cm (moderate intensity), &gt;10.0 cm severe intensity). Injection site AEs are presented as the percentage of participants experiencing a reaction, by reaction type, overall and by severity, using the participant’s worst reported severity grade. Only categories for which there was at least 1 participant are reported.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Unsolicited AEs are any AEs that are not solicited local or systemic AEs, as defined by this study. Unsolicited AEs are presented as the percentage of participants experiencing at least one AE, overall and by severity, using the participant’s worst reported severity grade. Only categories for which there was at least 1 participant are reported.</description>
