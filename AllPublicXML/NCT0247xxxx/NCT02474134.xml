      interferon beta-1b products, Betaferon and PF530, in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomised, two-treatment cross-over study in healthy adult subjects
      to compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PF530 and
      Betaferon. Half of the subjects will be randomised to receive PF530 first and Betaferon
      second, and the other half will be randomised to receive the drugs in reverse sequence. Each
      study participant will complete two 7-day study periods (Period 1 and Period 2), separated by
      a 14-day washout period. In Part I of the study, 12 subjects will be enrolled for an initial
      assessment. In Part II, up to 36 additional subjects may be enrolled.
