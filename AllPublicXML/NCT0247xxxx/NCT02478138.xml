  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical lymph node involvement, in head and cancer neck patients, is one of the most
      important prognostic factors. Currently patients undergo neck dissection removing some or all
      nodes and neck involvement is retrospectively determined. Sentinel lymph node (SLN)
      identification and biopsy has become clinical practise in other areas including breast, skin,
      and gastric cancer. The gold standard for detecting metastatic lymph nodes is pathological
      analysis, but the lack of an accurate or clinically accepted way to identify sentinel lymph
      nodes in the cervical region has motivated the usage of indocyanine green (ICG) and
      near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) imaging (Pinpoint, Novadaq, Waterloo). A prospective
      clinical trial using a commercially available NIR system and ICG injection around the tumour
      site will evaluate the ability to detect and biopsy sentinel lymph nodes in head and neck
      cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical systems for fluorescence imaging using ICG have recently been published with
      reported SLN identification rates of 94-100% in breast and colorectal cancers. The
      traditional radioisotope method enables navigation to the site of skin incision by
      measurement of radiation uptake, whereas the ICG fluorescence method can precisely identify
      the site of skin incision by tracing the lymphatic vessels across the skin and without
      radiation exposure. Systematic reviews have shown that the incidence of false negative SLN
      biopsy is high in head and neck applications. Therefore, the fluorescence SLN method, can
      potentially provide more precise information regarding which lymph nodes should be removed.
      As the ICG fluorescence technique can identify the basin that includes not only SLNs but also
      para-SLNs where the lymphatic vessels drain, the average number of lymph nodes removed also
      tends to increase. In preliminary studies, the ICG technique achieves a high identification
      rate comparable to that of the radioactive method. There has been to date, however, only
      limited studies of this technique in the area of oral cancer lymph node mapping. In our study
      we propose to evaluate the potential application of ICG in the mapping and detection of SLN
      in cancers of the head and neck in comparison with the radioactive agent method. We
      hypothesize that NIR-guided SLNB could present a new, safe and sensitive alternative or
      addition to the conventional SLN procedure.
