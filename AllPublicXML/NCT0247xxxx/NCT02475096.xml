  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot-study aims to evaluate the effect size and feasibility of internet-delivered
      cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for children (age 8-12 years) with pain-predominant
      functional gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal
      pain and functional dyspepsia according to the Rome III criteria). The main component
      investigated in this study is exposure for gastrointestinal symptoms and for feared stimuli
      and situations. Children will participate along with one of their parents in the treatment.
      The parents will also receive specific modules with information on how to support their child
      in the treatment.

    <measure>Faces Pain Rating Scale. (FACES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 10 weeks, baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain intensity measured with a self-rating scale daily during 2 weeks at baseline and daily during 2 weeks after 9 months for analysis of effect.The Faces Pain Scale is a self-report measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain. Faces have four faces representing least pain and most pain on equal intervals on a scale from 0-10. Its validity is supported by a strong positive correlation (r=0.93, N=76) with a visual analogue scale (VAS) measure in children aged 5-12 years. The metric for scoring (0-10) conforms closely to a linear interval scale.</description>

    <description>Children and parents will receive 10 weekly modules of internet-delivered CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy). Parents will also receive 10 weekly specific modules for parents. Main components in the modules directed at children and parents are exposure for symptoms, feared stimuli and situations. The parents modules contain information on how they can support their children in the treatment and is based on social learning theory. Therapist support is provided through written messages within the secure platform. Therapists are trained CBT-psychologists.</description>

    <intervention_name>Internet-delivered CBT</intervention_name>
    <description>The treatment is based on an internet-delivered CBT-treatment for adults with IBS and on the adapted version for adolescents with functional gastrointestinal disorders. The protocol has been tested in an open face-to-face CBT study of children aged 8-12 years (n=20) with promising results.
Main component in the treatment is exposure for symptoms. The purpose of the treatment is to reduce fearful and anxious responses to symptoms and lessen avoidance of symptoms in the child, and to teach the parents how parental behavior can influence symptoms in children as well as how to support exposure. Detailed behaviour analysis is made for each individual and instruction is given on how to gradually expose to symptoms to lessen fear for symptoms and widen the behavioral repertoire.</description>

          -  Children between 8-12 years (until their 13th birthday) who have been diagnosed with
             any of the diagnoses irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia or functional
             abdominal pain according to the Rome III criteria.

          -  Any psychopharmacological medication should be stable since 1 month.

          -  Parents and children need to master Swedish, have access to a computer with internet
             access, and be willing to participate in 10 weeks of treatment with homework.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Simultaneous presence of serious somatic disease and / or if the child meets the
             criteria for other organic disease which better explains the symptoms.

          -  Psychiatric or social problems that are considered serious and in need of a more
             intense treatment than ICBT leads to exclusion. Children with higher school
             absenteeism than 40% will not be included. Neither will children who have an ongoing
             psychological treatment be included,
