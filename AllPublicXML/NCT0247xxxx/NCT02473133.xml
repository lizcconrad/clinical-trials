  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced stage III non-small cell lung cancer, the probability of
      local control remains low (about 17% at 1 year). Concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the
      standard treatment. An increase in total radiotherapy dose (from 66 to 74 Gray) has been
      proposed to improve local control, with contradictory results.

      Relevant FDG-PET scan images can be acquired during radio-chemotherapy, with a demonstrated
      prognostic impact and recently in a multicentre prospective study. A significant reduction in
      FDG uptake / volume (metabolic response) suggests that the radiotherapy target volume could
      be reduced during radiotherapy possibly improving organs at risk tolerance. Conversely, a
      lack of metabolic response may justify treatment intensification before the end of
      radiotherapy. The investigators hypothesis is to investigate the individual tumour
      heterogeneity on FDG-PET during radio-chemotherapy to reduce the volume to a biological
      target that could receive a higher total dose (personalized dose redistribution).

      The investigators objective is to determine whether tumour radiotherapy dose escalated up to
      74 Gy in 6.6 weeks can improve the disease Local Regional Control rate at 15 months (1 year
      after completion of RCT) by adapting radiotherapy target volume to the metabolic response as
      assessed on FDG-PET/CT performed at 42 Gy of concomitant radio-chemotherapy in stage III
      non-small cells lung cancer and warrant more extensive phase III study.

      Eligible patients will be allocated to one of 2 treatment groups:

        -  Arm A: Patients in the experimental arm will receive an individualized radiotherapy
           prescription up to a total dose of 74 Gy given in 6.6 weeks if they have a positive
           FDG-PET at 42Gy.

        -  Arm B: Patients in the standard arm will receive a single prescription of 66 Gy in 33
           fractions in 6.6 weeks, with 2 Gy fractions given once daily, 5 days a week, without
           target volume reduction or adaptation (whatever the FDG-PET result).

      In both arms, all patients will undergo 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (based platinum
      salts) and a curative radio-chemotherapy. In both arms all fields must be treated daily.
