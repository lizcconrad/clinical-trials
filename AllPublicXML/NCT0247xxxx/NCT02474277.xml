      The aims are to identify predictive indicators of hospitalized elderly medical patients' need
      for rehabilitation and to validate (known group validity) the Chair Stand Test

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the emergency department the assessment of acutely admitted elderly medical patients' need
      for rehabilitation is difficult as it has to been performed within 48 hours. Is it possible
      to use the the Chair Stand Test in combination with admission complaints and identified risk
      factors to predict the need for rehabilitation? An investigating of the Chair Stand Test is
      needed, as its validity with hospitalized patients is undocumented.
