      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of PV isolation with
      continued antiarrhythmic drug treatment (PVI+ADT) to PV isolation without continued ADT
      (PVI-ADT) in patients undergoing treatment for symptomatic recurrent AF.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that underwent PV isolation for paroxysmal or non-longstanding persistent AF and are
      free of arrhythmia at the end of the 3-month blanking period while taking ADT. Eligible
      subjects who sign the study informed consent form will be randomized into one of two study
      arms:

      PVI+ADT Group: continue ADT through 9 months follow-up PVI-ADT Group: no ADT through 9 months
      follow up

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patient has continued (IC or III) ADT throughout the 3-month blanking

          -  patient is free of symptomatic and asymptomatic AF (as evidenced by 1-day Holter) at
             the 3-month visit

          -  drug-resistant (at least one class IC or III) symptomatic AF was the primary
             indication for prior PV isolation

          -  in the three months prior to PVI, at least one episode of symptomatic or asymptomatic
             AF

          -  PV isolation was performed according to the standards set forward by the Task Force
             Document (sedation or general anesthesia)

          -  PV isolation was the only target for ablation (except for cavotricuspid (CTI) ablation
             if documented AFL)

          -  PV isolation was performed by point-by-point irrigated radio frequency (RF) guided by
             contact-force (Biosense) (10-30gr-continuous lesion)

          -  PV isolation (i.e. entry block) was verified in each vein after a waiting time and
             adenosine (with continued RF if acute reconnection)

          -  Signed Patient Informed Consent Form.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

             history is considered unreliable) or breastfeeding

          -  Acute illness or active systemic infection or sepsis

          -  Unstable angina

          -  Uncontrolled heart failure

          -  Myocardial infarction within the previous two (2) months

          -  History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities

          -  Contraindication to anticoagulation therapy (ie, heparin or warfarin)

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months

          -  Enrollment in any other study evaluating another device or drug

          -  Presence of intramural thrombus, tumor or other abnormality that precludes catheter
             introduction

          -  Patients not taking any class IC or III ADT at 3 months after PV isolation

          -  No documentation of entry block at initial PV isolation - no waiting time or
             adenosine.

          -  Additional linear ablation or defractionation during the initial procedure (except for
             CTI ablation for documented or induced cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent flutter).
