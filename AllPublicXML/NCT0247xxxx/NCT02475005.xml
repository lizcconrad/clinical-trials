  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a new app to help adolescents with
      chronic or reoccurring headaches self manage pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headaches dramatically affect adolescents' overall functioning and quality of life. We have
      developed a highly engaging mobile-based program that will help adolescents to make
      connections between behaviors and symptoms, and to ultimately improve functioning and quality
      of life. The mobile-based program will provide a state of the art pain tracker, a variety of
      coping strategies, and information about self-management of symptoms. This app will offer a
      maximally engaging way to help adolescents track their pain, make connections between
      lifestyle and pain, and learn key self-management skills.

      The study involves the participant being randomized into either the experimental group, where
      he/she will be using this mobile application to track their headache symptoms, or the control
      group, where he/she will receive headache treatment as usual; the control group will not be
      using an app for this study. The intervention will last for two months.

      Participants will be assessed at baseline, at 2-months post baseline, at 3-months post
      baseline, and at 6-months post baseline. All participants will be asked to complete online
      questionnaires about their headaches. We plan to enroll 144 adolescent participants with
      headaches, as well as one caregiver (meaning a parent/guardian) for each adolescent.
