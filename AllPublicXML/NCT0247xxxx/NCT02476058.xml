  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-42847922 in
      participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center (when more than one hospital works on a medical research study),
      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither the
      researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving) and
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study. This
      study will consist of an eligibility screening examination (between 28 days and 1 day prior
      to the first dose administration), a parallel group treatment phase of 10 days or 4 weeks,
      and a follow-up period of 2 weeks including 2 follow-up visits. The duration of study will be
      12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either JNJ-42847922,
      Diphenhydramine or Placebo. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Day 2, 11, 29, 31, 42</time_frame>
    <description>The LSEQ comprises 10 self-rating 100 millimeter (mm)-line analogue questions regarding changes in the quality of sleep and early morning behavior, following any given intervention. Scores range between 0 and 100. Scores beneath 50 indicate better sleep.</description>

    <measure>Computerized Cognitive Test Battery: ISLT (Verbal Learning and Memory) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2 , 5, 6, 10 and 11</time_frame>
    <description>The ISLT is a measure of verbal learning and memory and uses a well-validated list-learning paradigm. The task is administered using a computer. High frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shopping list) are read to the participant by the test supervisor at the rate of one word every two seconds. Once the [12] words have been read, the participant is asked to recall as many of the words as he/she can as quickly as possible. The test supervisor uses a mouse or stylus to mark the words recalled by the participant on the computer screen. When the participant can recall no more words, the same list is read a second time. The test supervisor records the words recalled by the participant on this trial. This is then repeated a third time. The delayed recall condition requires the participant to recall the words from the list after a delay without having the list read again.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 to 2, 5 to 6 and 10 to 11</time_frame>
    <description>Objective assessment: A central scoring facility was used to derive the PSG sleep parameters Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS) from the epochs and stages collected via the polysomnography (PSG) recordings. Each epoch is 30 seconds. Latency to persistent sleep (LPS; minutes): time from lights out to the first of 20 consecutive epochs (10 minutes) of non-wake, as determined by PSG recordings.</description>

    <description>Objective assessment: A central scoring facility was used to derive the PSG sleep parameter of Total Sleep Time (TST) from the epochs and stages collected via the PSG recordings. The PSG parameters provided an objective assessment of the subject's sleep on a given night. Total sleep time was defined as the number of non-wake epochs from the beginning of recording to the end of recording divided by 2.</description>

    <measure>Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-clinician Rated 30 (IDSC30) Score and Structured Interview Guide for Hamilton Depression Scale (SIGH-D) (as combined SIGHD-IDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 11, 29, 31 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The SIGHD-IDS is a combined structured interview guide to complete both the structured interview guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale (SIGH-D) and the Inventory of depressive symptomatology (IDS-C30). The SIGH-D interview guide is based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17; Williams 1988). It contains 17 items pertaining to symptoms of depression experienced over the past week. Score range is from 0 to 52. The IDS-C30 is a standardized 30 item, clinician rated, scale to assess the severity of a participant's depressive symptoms. The scale uses the 9 symptom domains of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria to measure symptom severity. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum score of 84. The higher the score the more severe the symptoms of depression.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-16 (QIDS-SR16) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 11, 29, 31 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a participant reported measure designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. Participants provide responses to each item of this instrument with a 4-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 0-3 for each item. The 7-day period prior to assessment is the usual recall period for assessing symptom severity. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. Using a scale of severity of depression of none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, corresponding QIDS-SR16 total scores are none 1-5, mild 6-10, moderate 11-15, severe 16-20 and very severe 21-27.</description>
