      The Phoenix Post-Approval Registry is an prospective, multi-center, single arm registry,
      sponsored by Volcano Corporation, to evaluate the short and long term performance and
      clinical outcomes of the Phoenix Atherectomy System. The study includes consecutive patients
      treated with the Phoenix Atherectomy System in a post-market (commercial device use) setting.
      Patients will be followed under real-world conditions for up to 12 months after the index
      procedure.

      All patients with a planned endovascular revascularization procedure receiving treatment with
      the Phoenix Atherectomy System as all or part of their PAD treatment strategy may be
      included. Written informed consent must be obtained from each patient prior to enrollment in
      the study. Enrolled patients will undergo PAD treatment that includes Phoenix atherectomy,
      according to institutional or local standard of care. Data collection will include medical
      record review of procedures performed according to standard of care.
