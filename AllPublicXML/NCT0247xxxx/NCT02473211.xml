  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For those chronic hepatitis C patients, who are interferon-ineligible or intolerant, there is
      a burning need for the development of pan-oral interferon-free regimen. The investigators
      examine the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir, a NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor and
      daclatasvir, an NS5A replication complex inhibitor in Chinese treatment-experienced cirrhosis
      patients with chronic G1b infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese genotype 1b HCV treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients are recruited and treated
      with 12 weeks sofosbuvir 400 mg daily plus daclatasvir 60 mg daily. At baseline, liver
      stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography (FibroScan®) is used to assess liver
      fibrosis and the single nucleotide polymorphism ofinterferon-λ 3 (IL-28, rs12979860, C or T)
      and IFLN4 (ss469415590, TT or ΔG) is determined. Serial measurement of plasma HCV RNA levels
      are performed with the use of the COBAS TaqMan real-time assay (Roche version 2.0), at
      baseline, Day 2,4 and 7, week 2,4 and 12, post-treatment week 12. The primary efficacy end
      point is a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients chronically infected with HCV Genotype-1b;

          2. Documented evidence of relapse after completion of previous course of interferon-based
             regimen with or without ribavirin;

          3. HCV RNA level greater than 10,000 IU/ml at screening;

          4. Patients with compensated cirrhosis are permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or prior history: Clinically-significant illness (other than HCV) or any other
             major medical disorder that may interfere with treatment, assessment or compliance
             with the protocol; individuals currently under evaluation for a potentially
             clinically-significant illness (other than HCV) are also excluded;

          2. Screening ECG with clinically significant abnormalities;

          3. Laboratory results outside of acceptable ranges at screening;

          4. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
