    <textblock>
      Nipple areolar-complex (NAC) sparing mastectomy, extending the concept of skin-sparing
      mastectomy, allows to leave the nipple-areola complex intact and to provide a better cosmetic
      result. Large operable T2-T3 breast cancer (BC), treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, may
      theoretically appear suitable for this surgical option, alternative to conventional
      mastectomy or breast conserving surgery in case of unfavorable size of the breast, when a
      good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been achieved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January 2009 to May 2013, 422 BC patients were progressively accrued to NAC-sparing
      mastectomy, of which 361 invasive BC patients underwent NAC-sparing mastectomy as first
      treatment (NAC-group), whereas 61 T2-T3 invasive BC patients underwent surgery after primary
      chemotherapy (NAC-PC group). 151 BC patients underwent primary chemotherapy and conventional
      mastectomy (PC group) from 2004 to 2009, has been evaluated as comparative group respect to
      NAC-PC group.

      Using propensity score matching, local disease-free survival (LDFS) in NAC-PC patients was
      first compared with that in PC patients.

      The NAC-PC cohort was then compared to NAC patients in terms of LDFS using two different
      matching criteria, one with tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one with tumor size
      before neoadjuvant chemotherapy as balancing covariates.

        Both the population of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC-PC and PC
        groups) were T2-T3 N0-N1 breast cancer.

        The population of patients who underwent NAC-sparing mastectomy as primary therapy
        (NAC-group) were T1-T3 N0-1 M0 breast cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        T2-T3 N0-N1 breast cancer (NAC-PC and PC groups). T1-T3 N0-1 M0 breast cancer (NAC-group)
        In our series of NAC-sparing mastectomy patients, with or without treatment with
        neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, the selection of patients for NAC-sparing mastectomy has been
        made on the basis of the following criterions: tumor nodule without adherence to the skin,
        no nipple retraction, retroareolar main duct free for neoplastic tissue inside at frozen
        section examination. Furthermore, patients were considered still eligible for NAC-sparing
        mastectomy even if the tumor lies in close proximity (&lt;1 cm) to the NAC at physical and
        radiological examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (NAC-PC and PC groups). Exclusion criteria for the present study were all the other breast
        cancer patients, particularly T4 breast cancer with inflammatory or ulcerated breast cancer
        before chemotherapy and patients with synchronous distant metastases. Patients affected
        with other clinical diseases (i.e. cardiovascular diseases) conditioning the optimal
        therapeutic strategy were excluded.

        For NAC-sparing mastectomy, exclusion criterions were nipple retraction, Paget's disease,
        inflammatory changes of the breast and bloody discharge from the nipple. The study did not
        exclude women with prior breast augmentation, heavy smokers, obese patients.
