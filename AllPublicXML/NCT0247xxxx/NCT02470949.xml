      The scope of work outlined in this proposal will investigate experimentally manipulated
      social status on acute eating behavior, energy intake, and risk for obesity. This will be
      accomplished using a randomized, crossover design to place young adults in experimental high
      and low social status conditions. At visit 1, participants will complete baseline
      measurements, and then consume a standardized breakfast. In order to control for the
      influence of stress on eating behavior in both conditions, the participants will participate
      in the Stroop Test, a test known to induce stress in individuals, following breakfast. Using
      a computerized randomization scheme, each participant will be randomized to either the low or
      high social status condition (½ will receive high first; ½ will receive low first) and will
      receive the packet of rules and instructions for their respective condition. The participants
      will play Monopoly for up to 2 hours with another player they have not previously met. At the
      end of the game, the high social status player will be told that they won, and the low social
      status player will be told that they lost. The participants will participate in the Stroop
      Test again. Then the investigators will take the players into the Children's Eating
      Laboratory, where a buffet ad libitum lunch will be served in separate rooms. The
      participants will have 30 minutes to consume their lunch and plate waste will be measured to
      assess each participant's dietary intake. There will be a 4-week washout period and the
      second visit will be exactly like the first, except that they will participate in the
      alternate social status condition. The investigators will evaluate whether there was
      within-subject variation in dietary intakes based upon which social status condition they
      were placed in.
