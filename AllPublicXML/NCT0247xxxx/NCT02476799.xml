  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectus sheath block (RSB) is a kind of anterior abdominal wall block. It has postoperative
      analgesic effect for abdominal surgery with midline incision. Laparoscopic gynecologic
      surgery is accompanied by significant postoperative pain and usually IV-PCA is used to manage
      the pain.The purpose of this study is to investigate the analgesic effect of
      ultrasound-guided RSB to multi-port laparoscopic gynecologic surgery which has incision site
      at umbilical area. Patients will randomly assigned to two groups, RSB group and Control
      group. Each patients will assessed for time to first rescue analgesia, verbal numerical
      rating pain scores, number of rescue analgesic demands, and postoperatively opioids use by
      IV-PCA by a blinded investigator at 0, 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.

      Patients of RSB group will be performed ultrasound-guided bilateral RSB after induction of
      general anesthesia. The procedure will be performed bilaterally and 15 ml on each side, total
      30 ml of 0.25% ropivacaine will be injected. After the procedure, a surgery scheduled will be
      proceeded. Patient of Control group will be proceeded the surgery after induction of
      anesthesia. All patients will use total 100 ml of IV-PCA containing 800 µg of fentanyl with
      150 mg of ketorolac for 48 hours postoperatively. If a patient complains pain more intense
      than VNRS 4 or demands an analgesic drug, a rescue analgesic would be allowed.

    <description>Patients of RSB group will be performed ultrasound-guided bilateral RSB after induction of general anesthesia. After draping the needle insertion site, a 22-gauge, 50-mm needle will be inserted medial to the probe by the in-plane technique and advanced in a lateral direction on just lateral to umbilicus. 15 ml of 0.25% ropivacaine will be injected on the posterior border of rectus muscle. This procedure will be performed bilaterally and total 30 ml of 0.25% ropivacaine will be injected. After the surgery, a bandage will be attached on injection site where is same as the incision site of surgery. All patients will use total 100 ml of IV-PCA containing fentanyl and ketorolac for 48 hours postoperatively.</description>

    <description>Patients of Control group will be proceeded a surgery scheduled after induction of general anesthesia without any procedure such as placebo injection. After the surgery, a bandage will be attached on the incision site where is same as the block injection site of RSB group. All patients will use total 100 ml of IV-PCA containing fentanyl and ketorolac for 48 hours postoperatively.</description>
