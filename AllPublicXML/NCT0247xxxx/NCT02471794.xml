      The primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of implementing an evidence based
      patient engagement strategy, known as personalized health planning (PHP), in the context of a
      a shared medical appointment (SMA) for individuals with type II diabetes in a primary care
      setting.

      All data for the prospective portion of this study was done being collected in September
      2016. The retrospective chart review will collect data up until March of 2017 (six months
      after the last subject completed the prospective phase by attending their last SMA session).

    <description>The SMA group will be a standard shared diabetes medical appointment group consisting of up to 10 patients that utilizes the design and curriculum of the SMAs that are currently being held at the Duke Family Medicine Center.</description>

    <description>The PHP SMA group will combine personalized health planning with a modified version of the standard shared diabetes medical appointment. Modifications include: a self-assessment of health status, greater emphasis on a collaborative patient-provider health goal-setting process, a plan to meet goals, a mindfulness practice included in each session, and the creation of a 'personalized health plan' participant notebook for each individual to document health goals and track progress to review at each session. The participant notebook also includes educational handouts and worksheets to complement the educational curriculum.</description>

    <description>A retrospective chart review will be conducted once all participants (both SMA group and PHP SMA group) complete the intervention. The retrospective chart review will collect healthcare utilization data six months prior, during, and after each subject's participation in the SMA.</description>
