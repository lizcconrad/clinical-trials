    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators would like to describe FDG-PET/CT responses in patients who
      are receiving CART-19 immunotherapy for Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse Large B-cell
      Lymphoma (DLBCL), and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) as part of UPCC #13413. Subjects will
      undergo two FDG-PET/CTs. One performed within 6 weeks of CART-19 infusion and a repeat scan
      at about 1 month after infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects enrolled on the study UPCC 13413 Pilot Study Of Redirected Autologous T Cells
             Engineered To Contain Anti-Cd19 Attached To Tcr And 4-1bb Signaling Domains In
             Patients With Chemotherapy Resistant Or Refractory Cd19+ Lymphoma CART-19 autologous
             T-cell trial with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and FL. As this is a pilot study, we
             plan to enroll 4 subjects from the two disease types of interest.

               -  Subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age

               -  Subjects able to provide informed consent and agree to comply with study
                  procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subjects will be co-enrolled in this study and UPCC 13413 and therefore must comply
             with the UPCC 13413 Pilot Study Of Redirected Autologous T Cells Engineered To Contain
             Anti-Cd19 Attached To Tcr And 4-1bb Signaling Domains In Patients With Chemotherapy
             Resistant Or Refractory Cd19+ Lymphoma requirements pertaining to pregnancy,
             lactation, conception and contraception use throughout their participation in both
             studies.
