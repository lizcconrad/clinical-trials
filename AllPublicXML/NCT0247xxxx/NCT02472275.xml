    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of multitargeted tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor PLX3397 (PLX3397) when given together with radiation therapy and antihormone
      therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that is at intermediate or high risk of
      spreading. Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may also help the radiation
      therapy work better. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Androgens
      can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as leuprolide
      acetate, goserelin acetate, or degarelix, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the
      body. Giving multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 with radiation therapy and
      antihormone therapy may be a better treatment for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a phase I, dose escalation trial with a primary objective of establishing the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effects of radiation therapy (RT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and
      PLX3397 (at its MTD) on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the prostate biopsy after
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397.

      Patients receive multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) for 6 months, undergo radiation therapy for 2 months daily (Monday-Friday) beginning at
      month 3, and undergo ADT with leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, or degarelix injections
      in any month.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 20-30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
