    <textblock>
      The primary objective in this study is collecting post-marketing information on the safety.
      Thus, it includes information under the routine clinical practice on adverse events (AEs) and
      adverse drug reactions (ADRs) including expulsion and abnormal bleeding that occur within the
      first 12 months Mirena insertion.

      The secondary objective(s) in this study is/are collecting information on Mirena
      effectiveness, such as periodic blood loss and Quality of life (QOL), use of analgesic and
      dysmenorrhea pain as far as these are recorded under routine clinical practice.

      This local, non-interventional, multicenter, single-cohort study using primary data includes
      patients treated with Mirena for Heavy menstrual bleeding(HMB) and/or dysmenorrhea
      (contraception is not included).

      A total of 600 patients (valid for safety analysis) is planned to be enrolled in two years.
      No formal sample size estimation was conducted, it was determined based on feasibility.

      Target population is patients with HMB and/or dysmenorrhea diagnosis. The treatment should be
      performed based on the product label in Japan. The standard observation period will last for
      12 months from starting Mirena treatment.
