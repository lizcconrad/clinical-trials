      This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational study. Participants who
      received bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone(VMP) therapy for Multiple myeloma (MM) that was
      not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation will be enrolled in the study. The
      study will consist of Screening phase; VMP therapy phase (9cycles); Follow-up phase (2 years
      from the day when the first cycle was started). Participants visited each institution for
      evaluation for 2 years from the date of baseline evaluation and first VMP administration
      (duration of treatment, 9 cycles; follow-up visits, every 3 months after the end of the
      treatment). Participants receiving VMP therapy will be primarily evaluated for 2-year
      progression-free survival rate. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.
