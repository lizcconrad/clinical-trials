      PLUM evaluates the drug letrozole as a treatment for uterine fibroids. This study is a
      randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of oral letrozole among premenopausal women
      with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
      either oral letrozole 2.5mg/day for 6 months (Group A) or intermittent dosing with letrozole
      2.5mg/day and an identical placebo capsule (Group B).

These data will provide preliminary information on the safety of letrozole use beyond 3 months (Group A) and the rate of fibroid regrowth after letrozole is discontinued (Group B).</description>
