  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent disease that caused a lateral curvature
      on spine. Spine curvature increases in youths as puberty progresses. The recommended
      treatment for AIS is different depends on the spine deformity condition. For mild scoliosis
      (Cobb's angle ≤ 20°), only periodic observation is suggested. For scoliosis cases that the
      Cobb's angle ≤ 40°, a rigid brace treatment is recommended. A rigid brace that made by rigid
      plastic material restrict nearly all movements of the wearers, which caused irritation.
      Flexible brace is an alternative option, however, the efficiency of such treatment is
      questionable in terms of controlling the spine curvature progression.

      Biofeedback has proven to be effective for a number of physical, psychological and
      psychophysical problems. The basic aim of biofeedback therapy is to support a patient in
      realizing his/her self-ability to control specific psychophysiological processes.

      In this study, a biofeedback embedded tank-top with a specialized design for adolescents as a
      treatment option for AIS patients by monitoring the daily posture of the wearers.

      This project aims to combine the clinical experience with textiles and biofeedback mechanism
      to research and develop a biofeedback embedded tank-top for AIS. As a result, this will
      reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      In this study, the eligible subjects will be given tailor-made biofeedback tank-top to wear
      it 8 hours daily. Monitor, observation and additional posture training sessions will be
      provided during the 6 months wearing period. The effectiveness of the biofeedback tank-top
      will be evaluated by pre-and post- treatment ultrasonic imaging device (for measuring the
      angle of the spine), electromyography muscle signal assessment and clinical photographs
      assessment.

    <description>The design of biofeedback tank-top will incorporate sensors to record and monitor the posture of the wearer in real time basis. Alerts will be emitted to the wearer once &quot;poor&quot; posture is detected. The tank-top will be designed to fit the wearer's body and allow the sensor to be placed securely at the targeted position along the spine to minimize the noise from other factors than the wearers' posture and yet comfortable for long-term wearing.</description>
