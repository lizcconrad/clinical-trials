  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EarLens System is an assistive hearing device that is intended to provide amplification
      for the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing impairment. The purpose of the
      proposed study (Extended Investigation under the Continued Access Policy) is to continue to
      allow access to the investigational medical device with the collection of device utility and
      clinic process-flow data while the marketing application is under review at the FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to obtain observational data and as such no primary safety or efficacy
      endpoints or sample sizes are computed. Information gathered about device utility and clinic
      procedures from the physician, audiologist as well as subject questionnaires will be analyzed
      for the purpose of optimizing the process flow in different types of practice settings. A
      subset of relevant safety and efficacy measures from the Definitive Study (DEN150002) will be
      collected and adverse events will be tracked and reported per applicable regulations.

    <measure>Change in Hearing Stability Using Unaided Air Conduction Thresholds.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90-day.</time_frame>
    <description>Hearing sensitivity was monitored using earphones with the TMT (Tympanic Membrane Transducer) in place, but with the audio processor removed. Baseline and study end measurements were compared. A PTA4 (Pure Tone Average at 4 frequencies; 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) was computed both for baseline unaided hearing post-placement with TMT in place, and unaided hearing with TMT in place at the 90-day for each ear, then averaged across both ears for each subject. A determination of &quot;No Hearing Change&quot; for the subject was made if the calculated hearing changes of the subject population are 10dB or less.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Speech Understanding in Noise.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90-day.</time_frame>
    <description>The change in aided speech reception thresholds (SRTs) when compared to the baseline unaided condition was measured using a validated speech test, the HINT 90.
Change in aided HINT 90 SRTs when compared to the baseline unaided condition. SRTs will be measured using HINT materials with the signal (speech level presented from 0 degrees) adapted relative to the noise (presented from 90 degrees held fixed at 60 dB SPL) to determine the signal-to-noise ratio for reporting the whole sentence correct 50% of the time (Nilsson et al., 1994). An improvement in HINT score is indicated as a negative (-) dB value change. A more negative value indicating an improvement of understanding speech and noise. An improvement of -1dB is equivalent to a 10% improvement in understanding speech and noise and is likely of clinical benefit. HINT 90 will be measured twice and averaged to obtain the per subject HINT SRT. All subject data will be averaged to obtain the means.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Gain Over the Frequency Range From 2000 to 10,000 Hz.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90-day.</time_frame>
    <description>10 dB (decibel) change in the average pure tone thresholds for the subject population over the frequency range from 2000 to 10,000 Hz (2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000, and 10,000 Hz). Measurement to be used in analysis are the baseline unaided soundfield (SF) thresholds measured prior to device placement and the aided soundfield thresholds measured 90-day post placement. Analysis includes calculation of the unaided soundfield thresholds minus aided soundfield thresholds</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subject's Self-Perceived Ability to Communicate.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90-day.</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the subject's self-perceived ability to communicate with the use of the EarLens Device (CHD) when compared to baseline condition was measured using the validated Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire. The APHAB produces scores for 4 subscales: Ease of Communication (EC), Reverberation (RV), Background Noise (BN), and Aversiveness (AV), which all range from 0-99%. A global score is computed by averaging the EC, RV, and BN subscores. For an individual score (either unaided alone or aided alone), a higher number indicates poorer performance, or more difficulty experienced. For this outcome measure, the difference between the average of the global unaided and aided scores is computed to determine the reduction (if any) in self-perceived difficulty, so a larger number in this outcome measure indicates better performance, as more of the difficulty has been reduced from the unaided condition by going to the aided condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90-day.</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events will be recorded on case report forms and determinations will be made as to the whether the events are Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects and/or related to the investigational device or the procedure.</description>

        <title>Change in Hearing Stability Using Unaided Air Conduction Thresholds.</title>
        <description>Hearing sensitivity was monitored using earphones with the TMT (Tympanic Membrane Transducer) in place, but with the audio processor removed. Baseline and study end measurements were compared. A PTA4 (Pure Tone Average at 4 frequencies; 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) was computed both for baseline unaided hearing post-placement with TMT in place, and unaided hearing with TMT in place at the 90-day for each ear, then averaged across both ears for each subject. A determination of &quot;No Hearing Change&quot; for the subject was made if the calculated hearing changes of the subject population are 10dB or less.</description>

        <title>Change in Speech Understanding in Noise.</title>
        <description>The change in aided speech reception thresholds (SRTs) when compared to the baseline unaided condition was measured using a validated speech test, the HINT 90.
Change in aided HINT 90 SRTs when compared to the baseline unaided condition. SRTs will be measured using HINT materials with the signal (speech level presented from 0 degrees) adapted relative to the noise (presented from 90 degrees held fixed at 60 dB SPL) to determine the signal-to-noise ratio for reporting the whole sentence correct 50% of the time (Nilsson et al., 1994). An improvement in HINT score is indicated as a negative (-) dB value change. A more negative value indicating an improvement of understanding speech and noise. An improvement of -1dB is equivalent to a 10% improvement in understanding speech and noise and is likely of clinical benefit. HINT 90 will be measured twice and averaged to obtain the per subject HINT SRT. All subject data will be averaged to obtain the means.</description>

        <title>Change in Subject's Self-Perceived Ability to Communicate.</title>
        <description>The change in the subject's self-perceived ability to communicate with the use of the EarLens Device (CHD) when compared to baseline condition was measured using the validated Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire. The APHAB produces scores for 4 subscales: Ease of Communication (EC), Reverberation (RV), Background Noise (BN), and Aversiveness (AV), which all range from 0-99%. A global score is computed by averaging the EC, RV, and BN subscores. For an individual score (either unaided alone or aided alone), a higher number indicates poorer performance, or more difficulty experienced. For this outcome measure, the difference between the average of the global unaided and aided scores is computed to determine the reduction (if any) in self-perceived difficulty, so a larger number in this outcome measure indicates better performance, as more of the difficulty has been reduced from the unaided condition by going to the aided condition.</description>
