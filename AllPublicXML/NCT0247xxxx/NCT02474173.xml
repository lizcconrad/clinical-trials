    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose onalespib when given together with
      paclitaxel in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced).
      Onalespib works by blocking proper processing of proteins that are important for cancer
      growth. This results in inability of these proteins to work properly. Paclitaxel kills breast
      cancer cells by interfering with their ability to divide. Giving onalespib together with
      paclitaxel may be better in treating patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of onalespib (AT13387) in combination
      with paclitaxel in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      II. To determine the toxicity profile (based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events [CTCAE] version [v.]5.0) of the combination of AT13387 in combination with paclitaxel
      in patients with advanced TNBC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of AT13387 on pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in the study patient
      population.

      II. To determine the effect of paclitaxel on pharmacokinetics of AT13387 in the study patient
      population.

      III. To observe anti-tumor activity determining the overall response rate (partial response +
      complete response), response duration and progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib.

      SAFETY RUN-IN: Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day -7.

      TREATMENT: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1, 8, and 15. Patients also
      receive onalespib IV over 1 hour beginning on days 8 and 15 of course 1 and on days 1, 8, and
      15 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
