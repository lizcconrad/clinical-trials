  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present research will pilot-test a new state-of-the-art Internet-based intervention
      targeting adherence facilitation and optimization of medication use, and will be evaluated to
      assess its utility in facilitating adherence and optimization of medication use for acute
      migraine pharmacotherapy. This is not an interventional study and will instead be an
      observational assessment of the feasibility of an online program (a proof-of-concept study).
      The two principal objectives of this study include: (a) examination of the feasibility and
      user usage patterns of an Internet-based intervention designed to potentially enhance
      adherence to medication use recommendations, and (b) determination of the efficacy of the
      Internet-based intervention in potentially increasing knowledge of abortive medication-use
      guidelines and in improving adherence to those guidelines. To meet the objectives of this
      study, a website has been specifically developed including a series of supplemental
      text-based headache materials and a series of videos based social learning theory and
      modeling principles (as opposed to the stereotypical 'talking-heads' mode of information
      delivery).

      Objective 1. To examine the feasibility and user usage patterns/demand of an online
      intervention designed to enhance adherence and optimize abortive medication-use for
      migraineurs.

      Goal 1: To evaluate the practical utility of an Internet-based user environment to host an
      intervention designed to increase knowledge of and facilitate adherence and optimize abortive
      medication use.

      Hypothesis 1A: That an Internet-based user environment can be appropriately suited to deliver
      an adherence intervention that, in turn, could be made widely accessible and readily
      employed.

      Hypothesis 1B: That a high proportion of patients referred to the adherence facilitation Web
      site will actually visit and make use of the adherence intervention Web site.

      Hypothesis 1C: That once the Web-based intervention is initiated, a low attrition rate will
      be observed and the majority of patients will complete the intervention.

      Objective 2. To examine the efficacy of an online adherence facilitation and medication
      optimization intervention in increasing knowledge of optimal abortive medication-use.

      Goal 2: To conduct a pilot trial examining the efficacy of an adherence and medication
      optimization intervention for improving knowledge and medication-use behavior in a wide range
      of migraine sufferers.

      Hypothesis 2A: That patients who complete the Web-based intervention will demonstrate
      improved knowledge of optimal abortive medication strategies at post-treatment and this
      knowledge will be maintained at follow-up.

      Hypothesis 2B: That patients who complete the Web-based intervention will report improved
      abortive medication use strategies at post-treatment and this behavior change will be
      maintained at follow-up.

    <description>After providing informed consent, participants will complete a series of questionnaires related to their headaches and medication beliefs. After completion, they will have full access to an informational website including access to text-based supplemental materials pertaining to headache and headache treatment, and a series of videos designed specifically for this trial. Participants will be asked to watch seven videos of approximately four-minute length each and to complete a post-assessment question following the completion of each of the first 6 videos. The total time required to complete all study activities will be approximately one hour.</description>

        This study will enroll N = 300 participants. The proposed study is primarily powered to
        estimate the rate at which headache patients will likely seek out the Web site within a
        desired precision range (i.e., Hypothesis 1A). This sample size will allow the
        characterization of the various event rates within a precise range. For example, this
        sample size would allow a precision of +/- 5% around most event rates (i.e., use rates,
        attrition rates, etc.). Finally, even with a large attrition rate (i.e., 50%) the proposed
        sample size will allow the detection of even small changes (e.g., d = 0.20) in the
        adherence measures (assuming adequate reliability, and a modest correlation between
        measurement occasions).
