  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser photocoagulation and intravitreal anti-vascular growth factor injections are commonly
      used treatment options for individuals with diabetic macular edema. However, some patients
      continue to experience persistent diabetic macular edema and poor vision despite continued
      laser and/or anti-vegf therapy. Recent clinical trials suggest that due to inflammatory
      mediators dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7mg) may be a good alternative therapy for
      individuals unresponsive to laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-vascular growth
      factor injections. The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of
      using a dexamethasone steroid implant versus monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for
      research participants with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macular edema is a major cause of central vision loss in patients presenting with diabetic
      retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema (DME) occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the
      macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid makes the
      macula swell, blurring vision. Diabetic macular edema (DME) affects between 8% to 10% of 23.6
      million diabetic individuals in the United States. The prevalence of diabetic macular edema
      after 15 years of known diabetes is approximately 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes, 25%
      in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin, and 14% in patients with type 2
      diabetes who do not take insulin. Within two years of diagnosis, nearly half of individuals
      with DME will lose 2 or more lines of visual acuity (the smallest line you can read on a
      standardized vision chart held 20 feet away).

      Diabetic macular edema is typically treated with laser and/or intravitreal injections of
      drugs such as anti-VEGF agents. Anti-VEGF agents block a protein that slows the growth of the
      abnormal blood vessels. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation.
      Dexamethasone implant is a steroid implant injected into the eye to treat swelling that may
      occur when there is a blockage of certain blood vessels in your eyes. Both anti-VEGF agents
      and dexamethasone implant are approved by the FDA to treat DME.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of using a dexamethasone
      steroid implant versus monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for research participants
      with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME).

    <description>Subjects randomized to dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7mg) will receive the initial treatment at Month 3 (visit 4) and Month 6 (visit 7) and are eligible to receive one additional dose at Month 9 (visit 10), Month 10 (visit 11) or Month 11 (visit 12) for persistent or recurrent macular edema documented on SDOCT. If dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7mg) is administered at Month 10 (visit 11) or Month 11 (visit 12) an additional safety study visit will be required at one to two months following Month 12 (visit 13). The investigator can withhold treatment with dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7mg) beginning at Month 9 if there is complete resolution of diabetic macular edema document on SDOCT.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to continue on anti-vegf therapy will receive intravitreal anti-vegf injections at Month 3 (visit 4) Month 4 (visit 5) and Month 5 (visit 6). Beginning at Month 6 (visit 7), subjects who have received 6 intravitreal anti-vegf injections and continue to present with persistent diabetic macular edema defined as less than 10% reduction or any increase in CST compared to baseline values and CST is greater than 300 microns, will receive dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7mg) at Month 6 (visit 7) and Month 9 (visit 10). The follow-up period for all subjects will continue through 12 months from the baseline study visit.</description>
