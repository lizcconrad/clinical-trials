  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise
      capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with both peripheral vascular disease or
      COPD. Many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have reduced exercise capacity, The
      investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate consumption might increase incremental shuttle
      walk test (ISWT) distance in dilated cardiomyopathy subjects compared to a placebo beetroot
      juice.

      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise
      capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with both peripheral vascular disease or
      COPD. Many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have reduced exercise capacity, The
      investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate consumption might increase incremental shuttle
      walk test (ISWT) distance in dilated cardiomyopathy subjects compared to a placebo beetroot
      juice. This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Resting
      blood pressure, phlebotomy and ISWT will be performed. Following completion, each subject is
      randomized to consume beetroot juice or placebo. 3 hours later, the same assessments are
      repeated by the same people. After a 7d washout, the entire protocol is repeated with the
      crossover beverage.
