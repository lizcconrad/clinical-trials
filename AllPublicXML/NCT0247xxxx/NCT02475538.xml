    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the efficacy of electroacupuncture for tapering benzodiazepines in
      long-term users. All eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to (1)
      Electroacupuncture combined with gradual tapering; and (2) Placebo acupuncture combined with
      gradual tapering.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent randomized controlled studies support that acupuncture has beneficial effects for
      insomnia. Primary insomnia patients receiving electroacupuncture showed an increase in sleep
      diary-derived sleep efficiency from an average of 69.8% at baseline to 81.2% at 1-week
      post-treatment. A similar result was found in patients with residual insomnia associated with
      major depressive disorder.

      Acupuncture is efficacious in alleviating anxiety and insomnia symptoms; hence, it may help
      to reduce the impacts of withdrawal symptoms during benzodiazepine tapering. However, there
      has been no randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on
      benzodiazepine discontinuation.

    <description>Subjects in this group will be treated with electroacupuncture along with a gradual tapering schedule.
Benzodiazepines will be tapered off over four weeks. The expected reduction rate of benzodiazepines should be 25% in the first two weeks and 12.5% in 3-4 days in week 3 and week 4. If the participants cannot tolerate the effects after tapering according to our suggested plan, the dose can be kept unchanged or they can reduce the dose at a slower pace.
Subjects will receive electroacupuncture 2 times per week for 4 consecutive weeks. Electroacupuncture involves acupuncture needling at traditionally used acupoints according to Chinese medicine theory.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will be treated with placebo acupuncture along with a gradual tapering schedule.
Benzodiazepines will be tapered off over four weeks. The expected reduction rate of benzodiazepines should be 25% in the first two weeks and 12.5% in 3-4 days in week 3 and week 4. If the participants cannot tolerate the effects after tapering according to our suggested plan, the dose can be kept unchanged or they can reduce the dose at a slower pace.
The subjects will be receive placebo acupuncture 2 times per week for 4 consecutive weeks. Placebo acupuncture is a treatment that simulates the procedure of acupuncture treatment but may not have the effects of acupuncture.</description>

    <description>Gradual Tapering Benzodiazepines will be tapered off over four weeks. The subjects will be told by a blinded researcher to reduce their daily dose by 25% in the 1st and 2nd week. For the remaining 50%, subjects will be asked to reduce the dose by 12.5% each time for 3-4 days in the 3rd and 4th week. Subjects who are unable to taper according to the suggested plan can reduce dose at a slower pace.
Electroacupuncture The subjects will be treated with electroacupuncture at bilateral Sishencong (EX-HN1), Anmian, Shuaigu (GB8), Touwei (ST8), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Toulinqi (GB15), Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen (HT7), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Taichong (LV3), and unilateral Yintang (EX-HN3), Shenting (GV24), and Baihui (GV20). &quot;De qi&quot; is achieved if possible. The intensity of electric-stimulation will be adjusted up to a level the subject can tolerate without undue discomfort. The needles will be left for 30 min.</description>

    <description>Gradual Tapering The gradual tapering procedure will be the same as in the &quot;Electroacupuncture combined with gradual tapering&quot; group.
Placebo acupuncture Placebo needles designed by Streitberger will be used. The placebo needles are inserted to the site 1 inch beside the acupoints of the electroacupuncture group in order to avoid acupressure effect. The needles are held by surgical tape or hair pin to imitate the procedure of acupuncture. The needles are connected to an electric-stimulator with zero frequency and amplitude. The number, duration and frequency of treatment session will be the same as in the &quot;Electroacupuncture combined with gradual tapering&quot; group.</description>
