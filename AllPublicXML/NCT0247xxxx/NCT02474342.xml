    <measure>SPADI(Shoulder pain and disability index)Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant-Murley score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant score assesses pain, function, ROM, and strength. Pain is allotted a maximum of 15 points, activities of daily living (function)20 points, ROM 40 points, and strength 25 points. The component scores are summated to achieve a maximum possible total score of 100.</description>
