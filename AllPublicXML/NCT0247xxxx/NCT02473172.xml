    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of the assisted mode of mechanical ventilation on diaphragm
      efficiency in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. Participants will be
      randomized to the neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) mode or to the pressure support
      ventilation (PSV) mode.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During mechanical ventilation the ventilator applies positive pressure to the respiratory
      system. Often in the acute phase of critical illness patients are ventilated in the control
      mode (CMV), where the patient is completely passive. This quickly (within 48 hours) has been
      shown to induce diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction (Levine et al New England Journal of
      Medicine, 200; 358:1327-35). To preserve diaphragm function, guidelines suggest to shift as
      soon as possible to the assisted mode (the ventilator applies positive pressure to assist
      spontaneous inspiratory effort). The synchrony between patient and ventilator is critical in
      this context. PSV is the classical assisted mode and applies a constant pressure whatever the
      patient effort. NAVA is a newer mode based on the diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi)
      measurement. It assist patient effort proportionally to the EAdi and hence to patient's
      effort. The investigator hypothesis is that NAVA would improve diaphragm efficiency more
      efficiently than PSV.

    <description>Diaphragm neuro-ventilatory efficiency (NVE) to convert the electrical diaphragm activity (EAdi) into volume. NVE is impaired by controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and the assisted mode should serve to restore it. All the studied patents were ventilated for more than 48 hours in CMV, a period shown to be sufficient to induce diaphragm atrophy and therefore depress NVE. NVE is measured by the ratio between tidal volume (VT) and the EAdi peak (NVEpeak) or by the ratio between VT and the are under the EAdi signal. EAdi is obtained by the EAdi catheter, a nasogastric catheter equipped with electrodes (Maquet Critical Care, Solna, Sweden). EAdi is measured in microVolt. The Servo i ventilator (Maquet Critical Care, Solna Sweden) is equipped with a module able to amplify and show on a screen the EAdi trace and the corresponding value. Both the Servo i ventilator and the EAdi catheter are approved for clinical use.</description>

    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Diaphragm neuro-mechanical efficiency (NME) to convert the electrical diaphragm activity (EAdi) into negative pressure is impaired by controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). The assisted mode should serve to restore it. All the studied patents are ventilated for more than 48 hours in CMV, a period shown to be sufficient to induce diaphragm atrophy and hence depress NME.
NME is measured by simultaneously recording EAdi and airway opening pressure during an end-expiratory airway opening occlusion and expressed in centimeters of waters (cmH2O)/microVolt.</description>
