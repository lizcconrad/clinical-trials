    <textblock>
      This study investigates the influence of two different stretching techniques on the
      flexibility of the muscles that are in the posterior thigh, after a training period.

      The study will last for six weeks where the volunteers need to go to the lab twice for
      evaluation, and for four weeks, three times a week for the application of stretching
      training.

      Evaluation before and after the training period consists of applying hip and knee flexibility
      tests, evaluation of strength, muscle activation and muscle architecture. The Flexibility
      tests are: (1) Straight Leg Raise Flexibility Test (SLR), where the volunteer will be
      positioned supine on a stretcher. Then the appraiser will perform hip flexion keeping the
      knee extended and relaxed foot to the angle at which the person refer discomfort while the
      contralateral limb remain firmly leaning on the table; (2) Modified Passive knee extension
      (TEJ), where the volunteer will be positioned supine on a stretcher. The assessor shall
      determine the hip member to be rated at 90ยบ and perform knee extension to the angle at which
      the person refer discomfort. The contralateral limb remain firmly leaning on the table.

      For the evaluation of muscle strength the volunteer had sat on equipment, makes five
      repetitions of bending and straightening the knee to familiarize yourself with the equipment
      and after will make other five replicates doing maximum strength.

      To evaluate the electrical activity will be the depilation of the skin with a razor and
      cleaning with an alcohol swab after adhesive electrodes will be placed for collection of
      muscle activity, the electrodes do not emit shocks.

      The muscle architecture will be assessed via a ultrasound , to its use the use of a water
      soluble gel to improve the machine's skin contact is required.

      For the intervention, the stretching will be held in both legs, where the volunteer will
      remain lying on a stretcher with fixed trunk with velcro straps and the researcher will carry
      out the elongation raising the leg drawn to the moment of discomfort the volunteer will refer
      and will remain for 30 seconds (s) in case he belongs to passive static stretching group, if
      the stretching group of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, will be in the same
      position, but before the 30s of stretching, he you will have to push against during 6s to
      lower leg against the researcher.

      If he belongs to the control group, have only two trips to the laboratory for testing, will
      make an initial assessment and after four weeks will return to perform the tests again, in
      the period between assessments will not need to go to the lab because it does not make
      intervention elongation.

      It is possible that there discomfort during flexibility testing, strength testing and
      stretching training. After the tests can still experience muscle pain should disappear within
      48 hours. The risks of research are minimal, not exceeding those of a strength training
      session and stretching.

    <description>The training consists of a four-week program of passive stretching exercise with three times week/sessions with interval of 48 hours between them. Each session will consist of carrying out a single repetition of stretching exercise with 30s of duration, static or PNF, according to the group to which voluntary membership. The two lower members receive training but only the lower limb data drawn will be used for analysis.</description>
