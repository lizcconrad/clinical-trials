    <textblock>
      This randomized evaluation measured the impact of two levels of support for the integration
      of infant and postpartum maternal HIV testing with routine immunization services in Southern
      Zambia on the number of postpartum maternal HIV tests, infant HIV tests, and 1st dose
      diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT1) vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This evaluation assessed two levels of support for the integration of early infant and
      maternal HIV testing with existing routine immunization services in rural health facilities
      in Southern Zambia with the aim of determining whether infant and postpartum maternal HIV
      testing rates would increase without harming immunization uptake. The evaluation randomized
      60 health facilities to one of three study arms: 1) Control (status quo); 2) Simple
      Intervention; and 3) Comprehensive Intervention. The Simple Intervention included restocking
      of HIV test kits and reminding health facilities of existing HIV testing guidelines by
      government health officials. The Comprehensive Intervention included the Simple Intervention
      components, as well as community sensitization, hands-on operational support to integrate
      services and improve patient flow, and opt-out HIV testing for mothers and infants according
      to existing guidelines. The change in the average number of monthly HIV tests and
      immunizations (DPT1) between the intervention period and baseline were compared between
      treatment and control facilities.

    <description>District health officials met with facility staff to remind them of the current HIV testing policies for mothers and newborns in Zambia. Current policy states mothers with unknown or previously negative status should be tested every 3 months until the infant is 18 months of age. HIV-exposed newborns should be tested at 6 weeks and 6 months.</description>

    <description>Facility staff were instructed to examine the maternal HIV status on the under-five (U-5) or antenatal care (ANC) card for all infants attending their first U-5 visit and do the following:
If marked Confirmed Exposed (CE), the health care worker conducted the DBS test on the infant only.
If marked, Mother Status Unknown (MSU) or Confirmed Not Exposed (CNE) the mother or caregiver was asked if the mother had ever tested HIV-positive. If yes, a DBS was done on the infant only. If no, the mother was offered an HIV antibody test in an opt-out manner.</description>

    <description>The evaluation team worked with facility staff to identify efficient allocations of staff and tailor the order of services. A key component of the operational optimization was a new patient triaging approach that sorted patient U-5 cards into bins and used separate queues for three types of patients: 1) first visit infants (six weeks), 2) second visit or later infants who required immunizations and 3) infants who were scheduled to only receive growth monitoring.</description>

    <description>Health facility staff were instructed to communicate all aspects of the Comprehensive Intervention during ANC appointments, in-facility child birth deliveries, and postnatal care (PNC) visits. Additionally, at six week immunization visits, mothers and caregivers received group counseling on opt-out HIV screening service and the importance of regular HIV screening for mother and child health. Finally, the research team engaged Safe Motherhood Action Groups (SMAGs), community health workers (CHWs), and active neighborhood health committee members to further increase awareness in facility catchment areas. These community members completed low-touch community sensitization over changes that would be made to U-5 services.</description>
