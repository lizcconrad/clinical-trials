    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the efficacy of EMR compared to CSP in treatment of small
      colon polp (6~10mm).

      One aim of this study was to investigate the necessity of EMR on resection of small colon
      polyp.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With sized polyp from 6mm to less than 10mm, it has been classified by the previous studies
      as a &quot;small polyp&quot;.

      Their potential for advanced neoplasia is usually size-dependent, but some recent studies
      found that, even in diminutive and small polyps, the rate of advanced neoplasia is relatively
      high about 9%-10%.

      The investigators will prospectively investigate postprocedural outcomes, such as retrieval
      rate, procedural time, overall complication rate (Intraprocedural bleeding, postprocedural
      bleeding, and perforation) in colonoscopic polypectomy of small polyp between CSP and EMR.
