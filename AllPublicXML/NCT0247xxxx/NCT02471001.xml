  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, anaesthetic agents, Isoflurane used in heart surgery have shown some
      benefits to reduce the risk of heart muscle damage. Many research studies have been conducted
      to reveal the benefit relationship between Isoflurane and the risk of heart muscle injury
      during heart surgery. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the optimal level of
      Isoflurane concentration to confer the benefit of heart muscle-protective properties.
      Therefore, this study is conducted to answer that question by measuring the Isoflurane
      concentration in the blood vessels. It also assesses whether Isoflurane concentration in the
      blood is correlated to the oxygenator exhaust level of Isoflurane in the heart-lung machine.

      All patients who scheduled for an elective heart surgery in Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh
      using a heart-lung machine and the administration of ether-like anaesthetic, isoflurane will
      be recruited in this study. This is a pilot study to determine the concentration of
      isoflurane in heart muscle. Isaac and Michael (2005), Hill (1998), Julious (2005) have
      conducted survey/research to conclude that 30 sample sizes are adequate for a pilot study.
      Thus, investigators aim to recruit at least 30 sample sizes to allow data (standard
      deviation, mean etc.) used in sample size estimation for future studies.

      The medical and surgical care plans for participants remain as usual in this study. In a
      normal practise, surgeons will insert a catheter into the blood vessels coming from the heart
      to deliver solution to stop the contraction of heart for heart procedure. At this moment, two
      blood samples of about two-teaspoonful in volume will be collected from the in-placed
      catheters in vein and aorta. Then, the blood samples will be sent to lab to measure the
      concentration of isoflurane in vein and aorta. Also, the reading of exhausted isoflurane gas
      on heart-lung machine are routinely monitored and recorded.
