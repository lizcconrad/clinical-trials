      After successful screening, each subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the following
      six possible sequences, according a 1:1:1:1:1:1 randomization scheme:

      Sequence_1: Treatment A -&gt; Treatment B -&gt; Treatment C ; Sequence_2: Treatment A -&gt; Treatment
      C -&gt; Treatment B ; Sequence_3: Treatment B -&gt; Treatment A -&gt; Treatment C ; Sequence_4:
      Treatment B -&gt; Treatment C -&gt; Treatment A ; Sequence_5: Treatment C -&gt; Treatment A -&gt;
      Treatment B ; Sequence_6: Treatment C -&gt; Treatment B -&gt; Treatment A ;

      In study Period 1, Subjects will be administered MYL-1401H (Treatment A),
      EU-Neulasta(Treatment B) or US-Neulasta (Treatment C).

      After the 1st crossover, subjects will enter Study period 2 and will receive one of the
      remaining alternate treatments.

      After the 2nd crossover, subjects will enter Study period 3 and will receive the other
      alternate treatment.

      The washout between drug administrations is at least 4 weeks. Final follow-up visit is
      scheduled 4 weeks after the last study drug administration.
