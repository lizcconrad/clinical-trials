      This is a single center, open label, random comparison phase 2b study. The primary objective
      of this study is, by random comparison, to assess the anti-leukemia effect of allogeneic,
      donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells infused after HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) in patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the side effects of donor NK cell
      infusion, effects of donor NK cell infusion upon HCT outcomes, as well as effects upon
      post-HCT immune recovery.

      7.0.Treatment Plan

      7.1. For the study group of patients, donor NK cells will be generated from the hematopoietic
      cells. Donor NK cell will be produced in the GCP laboratory at Asan Institute of Life Science
      by a team of Stem Cell Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and
      Biotechnology.

      7.2. Patients will have a triple-lumen Hickman central-venous catheter (CVC) placed. Chest
      X-ray should be taken after CVC placement to confirm the location and the absence of hematoma
      formation or pneumothorax.

      7.3. Lumbar puncture will be done and preservative free methotrexate 10 mg/m2 (not to exceed
      15 mg total) will be given intrathecally.

      7.4. Menstruating women will be given norethindrone (Norlutate) 10 mg po daily.

      mg/kg/day iv daily on days -7 and -6. Patients who are older than 64 years of age or who have
      significant co-morbidities may receive Bu on day -7 only.

      7.5.2. Fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m2/day in D5W 100 ml iv over 30 minutes starting at 4 pm daily
      on days -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2.

      will be transplanted to the patients on the same day without further manipulation. At least
      2x106/kg of CD34+ cells should be collected on day 0. If not, additional collection may be
      scheduled under the discretion of attending physician. G-CSF is the most commonly
      administered agent to donors for cell-collection and there has been no documented long-term
      side effect document during last 25 years' use. However, the cell donors in the study will be
      monitored for possible side effect of G-CSF.

      Cancer Institute). GVHD will be diagnosed and graded by published criteria listed in Appendix
      III. TRM will be defined as any death occurring after the transplantation without leukemia
      progression.

      a previously documented CR. In patients with persistent leukemia after HCT, the day of
      leukemia progression was defined as the day on which leukemia blasts reappeared in peripheral
      blood with bone marrow examination showing over 5% persistent blasts.

      11.4. Event-free survival will be measured from the day of HCT to leukemia recurrence,
      transplantation-related mortality, or the last follow-up. Overall survival will be measured
      from the HCT to death from any cause or the last follow-up.
