      The aim of the study is to assess if vildagliptin and dapagliflozin have dissociated effects
      on glucagon secretion after a mixed meal ingestion in metformin-treated subjects with type 2
      diabetes and whether this is associated with effects on glucose homeostasis.

      The aim of the study is to assess if vildagliptin and dapagliflozin have dissociated effects
      on glucagon secretion after a mixed meal ingestion in metformin-treated subjects with type 2
      diabetes and whether this is associated with effects on glucose homeostasis. Subjects will
      therefore be treated with vildagliptin or dapagliflozin as add-on to metformin for two weeks
      followed by a meal test in which glucagon levels will be determined.
