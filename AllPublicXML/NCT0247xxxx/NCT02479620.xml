      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized pilot study to document the effects of
      adventitial delivery of dexamethasone after atherectomy-based revascularizations of lesions
      below the knee in symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Up to 120 patients
      (60 treatment and 60 control), including up to 20 Rutherford 6 patients (10 treatment and 10
      control) at up to 30 sites in the United States and Europe. This study will assess the safety
      and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device adventitial deposition of dexamethasone
      in reducing inflammation and restenosis in patients with clinical evidence of chronic
      critical limb ischemia with an angiographically significant lesion in the infrapopliteal
      crural vessels.

    <description>Up to 60 atherectomy-based revascularization procedures at up to 30 sites in the United States and Europe.
For Subjects randomized into the Dexamethasone Delivery arm, this protocol will utilize a 4 mg/mL preparation of Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection, USP. Each milliliter of the solution contains 4.37 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone phosphate or 3.33 mg of dexamethasone. The total dose of Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection, USP will be diluted by 20% prior to infusion. This will result in a final concentration of 3.2 mg dexamethasone phosphate (3.5 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate, or 2.67 mg dexamethasone) in each milliliter of solution.</description>

          -  Hemodynamically significant inflow lesion (≥50% DS) or occlusion in the ipsilateral
             iliac, SFA, or popliteal arteries in which there is failure to successfully treat and
             obtain a &lt;30% residual stenosis

             treatment, or use of any drug eluting stents (DES) or drug-eluting balloon/drug-coated
             balloons (DEB/DCB) for treatment of any infra-inguinal lesions during the study
             procedure or during the initial six-month follow up period
