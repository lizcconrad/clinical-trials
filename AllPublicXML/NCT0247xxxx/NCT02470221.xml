      This study is aim to assess the effect of goal-directed intraoperative fluid therapy on
      patient's postoperative incidence rates of complications, length of hospitalization and
      hospitalization cost.

      This is an observational study followed cohort study design, due to the two therapies were
      not randomized assigned to the two cohorts. The details are described as follow.

      The study will be conducted in patients undergoing either laparotomy of gynecological
      malignancies or orthopedic surgery in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The study
      included two stages.

      In the first stage, one cohort of 100 participants with conventional fluid therapy will be
      involved, in which 50 patients will be selected with laparotomy of gynecological malignancies
      and 50 patients will be selected with orthopedic surgery. All the participants in this stage
      will follow conventional fluid therapy to direct the amount of intraoperative fluid.
      Specifically, the fluid will be administered based on the principle crystalloid solution
      (colloid solution =2-3:1). The total volume of fluid will be adjusted in accordance with
      blood pressure, heart rate and urine output of each patient. It is a standard procedure in
      Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Then, the incidence of postoperative complications of
      each group will be recorded. In addition, sample size will be estimated based on above
      study's results (estimated 100 participants).

      In the second stage, goal-directed therapy will be applied to another cohort of 200
      participants, in which 100 patients undergoing laparotomy of gynecological malignancies and
      100 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Specifically, the fluid will be administered
      based upon real-time monitoring stroke volume variation and cardiac output achieved by the
      Flo-Trac monitoring system. The incidence of postoperative complications of each group will
      be recorded.
