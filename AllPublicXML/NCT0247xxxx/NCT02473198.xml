    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine if intrarticular injection with liposomal
      bupivicaine (Exparel) provides better postoperative pain relief and functional outcome
      following total knee replacement (TKR) than the current standard New England Baptist Hospital
      regimen of femoral nerve block combined with intraarticular injection of a standard
      bupivicaine solution.

      A prospective, single blind study comparing femoral nerve blockade and intraarticular
      posterior capsular injection to interarticular injection of bupivicaine and liposomal
      bupivicaine (Exparel) alone.

    <description>In group1 (standard group) all patients receive the standard current perioperative pain management protocol for TKR.
The patient will then undergo an ultrasound guided femoral nerve block with bupivacaine 0.25% 20 cc. Intraoperatively prior to cementing of the TKR, patients will also receive a local anesthetic injection of a mixture of 30cc 0.25% bupivicaine with epinephrine, 30mg of toradol and 10 mg of morphine sulfate into the posterior capsule of the knee joint. Postoperatively patients will receive narcotic pain medication on a PRN basis.</description>

    <description>Group 2 will receive standard perioperative pain management for TKR; will undergo placebo femoral nerve block under ultrasound guidance with normal saline (NS) 20 cc. Following femoral bone cuts they will receive local anesthetic injection mixture of 30cc 0.25% bupivicaine with epinephrine 20 cc of preservative free normal saline, 30mg of toradol and 10 mg of morphine sulfate into the periarticular tissues including periosteum, joint capsule and posterior capsule of the knee joint and collateral ligaments and subcutaneous tissues. Prior to cementing prosthesis, a second injection with mixture of 20mL 1.3% Exparel and 40mL normal saline solution will be injected into the same tissues, joint capsules and collateral ligaments.</description>
