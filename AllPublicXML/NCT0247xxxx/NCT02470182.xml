  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about breathing disorders during sleep. The
      investigators want to learn how breathing sounds made during sleep relate to breathing
      disorders during sleep.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing breathing problems
      during sleep with minimally obtrusive sensors (a bedside microphone and wireless pulse
      oximeter worn on the fingertip). The investigators will use the data collected with these
      sensors to develop algorithms for automatically detecting sleep apnea events. Subjects will
      be asked to place unobtrusive sensors (bedside microphone and wireless pulse oximeter) in
      their home sleep environment. The subjects will start the at-home data collection before they
      fall asleep, and stop the data collection the next morning when they wake. The subjects will
      then return the sensors to the investigator for analysis.

      We are looking for people interested in participating in the at-home portion of our study. We
      will only collect at-home data for one night of sleep per subject. After this one night, no
      further data collection or monitoring will occur. Subjects will be compensated for their
      time.

      A standard sleep-breathing questionnaire (the &quot;Berlin Questionnaire&quot;) will be administered.
      This questionnaire is widely used as a screening tool to determine if a person may have
      disordered breathing during sleep. This questionnaire consists of 10 multiple-choice
      questions related to snoring, daytime sleepiness, and other related conditions.

    <description>This study aims to see if it is feasible to assess breathing problems during sleep using a high-quality microphone and wireless pulse oximeter. Our primary objective is to determine if non-typical breathing sounds or patterns correspond to oxygen desaturations of 3% or more from baseline.</description>
