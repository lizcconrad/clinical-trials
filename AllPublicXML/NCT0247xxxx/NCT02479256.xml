      Participants fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will be divided into two groups,
      each group containing 300 participants;

      Group (A):

      300 participants will receive Clomiphene citrate oral tablets and placebo of Tamoxifen oral
      tablets.

      Group (B):

      300 participants will receive Tamoxifen oral tablets and placebo of Clomiphene oral tablets.

      Participants with abnormal menstrual history will receive two tablets of norethisterone 5mg
      tab (Steronate nor ®, hi pharm/Egypt) every12 hours for 5 days to withdraw period before
      starting the procedure.

      Then;

      Group (A):

      Women will receive one tablet of clomiphene citrate oral tablets 50 mg (Clomid®,
      aventis/Egypt) twice daily 12 hours apart (total dose 100 mg daily), and one tablet of
      placebo of tamoxifen oral tablets twice daily 12 hours apart from the 3rd day of the menses
      for 5 days, for only one menstrual cycle.

      Group (B):

      Women will receive one tablet of tamoxifen oral tablets 10 mg (Tamoxifen®, amriya/Egypt)
      twice daily 12 hours apart (total dose 20 mg daily), and one tablet of placebo of clomiphene
      citrate twice daily 12 hours apart from 3rd day of the menses for 5 days, for only one
      menstrual cycle.

    <description>Transvaginal ultrasound done to:
1. Detect signs of ovulation: corpus luteum, fluid in cul-de-sac, collapse of the follicle size.
Serum progesterone will be measured in the mid luteal day of the cycle, where:
Level 6 ng/ml or 19 nmol/L indicates Ovulation.
Level &lt;5 nmol/L suggests Ovulation did not occur.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endometrial perfusion by using 3D- power Doppler (GE Medical system volouson E6, 5-7 MHz) in the mid luteal day of the cycle to assess endometrial receptivity.</measure>

    <description>Endometrial perfusion by using 3D-power Doppler (GE Medical system volouson E6, 5-7 MHz) at Ain-Shams University Maternity Hospital will be done in the mid luteal day of the menstrual cycle to assess endometrial receptivity by measured:
Gray: mean Gray value.
Color angio: Flow index, Vascularization index, and Vascularization flow Index.</description>

    <measure>Endometrial thickness and quality in the pre-ovulatory period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks from starting treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Transvaginal ultrasound will be done to:
Evaluate endometrial thickness and quality pre-ovulatory: where the minimal endometrial thickness to achieve a pregnancy ranges from 4 to 7mm with a healthy trilaminar appearance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of growing follicles detected by transvaginal ultrasound.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks from starting treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Transvaginal ultrasound will be done to:
Detect mean follicular diameter in the days 10, 12, 14 and up to day 25 of the cycle.</description>

    <measure>Pregnancy rate both clinical and biochemical.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks from starting treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Transvaginal ultrasound done to:
Evaluate endometrial thickness and quality in the mid luteal day of the cycle: where the optimal endometrial thickness to achieve a pregnancy ranging from 10 to 15mm with a healthy trilaminar appearance.
Detect gestational and fetal pulsation.</description>
