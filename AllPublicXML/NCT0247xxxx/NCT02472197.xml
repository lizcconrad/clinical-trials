  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine pathologies are currently treated by hysteroscopic resection. In this surgical
      procedure, the intrauterine pathology is resected by a transcervical approach in several
      fragments using a mono or bipolar cove after distension of the uterine cavity and by
      endoscopic control. The main risks of this surgery are: uterine perforation and OHIA
      (operative hysteroscopy intravascular absorption) syndrome. Hysteroscopic morcellators are
      new intrauterine devices, recently appeared on the French market.

      In comparison to classical resectors, morcellators have several theoretical advantages:

        -  A smaller instrument diameter with potentially a lower risk of uterine perforation and
           cervical laceration during the dilatation procedure,

        -  The use of physiological serum, eliminating the risk of neurological toxicity of
           glycine,

        -  The risk of electrical accident is canceled (internal or external burns due to leakage
           current),

        -  A decreased risk of air embolism, due to the absence of bubbles' production,

        -  The instrument is always under visual control, the perforation risk by the active
           instrument is therefore very limited,

        -  The vision is not obscured by the fragments or by the bubbles,

        -  The treatment of pre-ostial pathologies, not always easy in classical resections, could
           be facilitated,

        -  the absence of thermal effect, and therefore a potentially lower endometrial aggression,
           is interesting in women with reproductive desire,

        -  Absence of chips management, limiting the entry and exit movements in the uterine
           cavity, improving the vision, reducing the infectious and traumatic risks, specially
           uterine perforation and air embolism,

        -  Morcellation could preserve tissues for histological analysis of possible malignancy
           (compared to techniques using heat, coagulation, vaporization),

        -  Easy learning in comparison to the time-consuming learning of classical hysteroscopic
           resection,

        -  Generated additional cost could be partly amortized by reducing operating time and
           complications.

      It seemed useful to study this new technology.

      The primary purpose was to compare the time of hysteroscopic treatment of uterine polyps
      between a hysteroscopic morcellator the UNIDRIVE S III / DrillCut-X II-GYN-Shaver (Integrated
      Bigatti Shaver IBS), StorzÂ®, and a conventional resectoscope.

      The secondary purposes were to compare the efficiency, complications and comfort of these
      techniques.
