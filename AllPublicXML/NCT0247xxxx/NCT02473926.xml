      This study plans to learn more about physical activity and physical function in sedentary
      older adults with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial with 1:1 patient-level
      randomization to an evidence-based physical activity program intervention versus usual care
      in sedentary older adults with type 2 diabetes in two primary care clinic sites.

    <description>The intervention seeks to increase physical activity and improve strength by addressing individual , behavioral, and social/environmental factors. Health promotion clinic staff will deliver counseling by phone on a bi-weekly basis - a clinic physician assistant will coordinate with the counselor during in-person clinic visits, teach participants to perform strengthening exercise, and assess for safety concerns associated with type 2 diabetes.
In addition to behavioral counseling targeting social cognitive theory constructs, counselors will assist participants in the intervention group to set specific goals for physical activity in a paper log and on an electronic FitBit activity tracking device.Health promotion clinic staff will encourage participants to advance goals towards meeting U.S. physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity activity and 2-3 days/week of strength activities.</description>
