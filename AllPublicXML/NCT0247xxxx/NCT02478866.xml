  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BPI-9016M is a novel, highly potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met/Axl
      kinase. In preclinical studies, it demonstrated strong activity in vitro and in vivo against
      c-Met/Axl kinase and its downstream signaling targets, and inhibited tumor cell growth. This
      first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary
      anti-tumor activity of BPI-9016M with single doses and multiple doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ia study, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of BPI-9016M
      administered orally once daily (QD) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors.The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single dose and multiple doses of BPI-9016M.

      All patients will be followed up for adverse events during the study treatment and 28 days
      after the last dose of study drug. Subjects of this study will be permitted to continue
      therapy only when BPI-9016M is well tolerated, and tumor response or stable disease is seen.
