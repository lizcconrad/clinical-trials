  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of ORM-12741 on agitation/aggression symptoms in Alzheimer's
      disease. Two thirds of the patients will receive ORM-12741 and one third will receive
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ORM-12741 is a potent and selective alpha-2C adrenoceptor (AR)-antagonist. Previous results
      suggest that the compound may have positive effects on both cognitive and neuropsychiatric
      symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. In this study, the effect of ORM-12741 will be evaluated on
      agitation/aggression symptoms and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, cognition and
      psychotic and depressive symptoms will be evaluated.

             accompany the subject to all visits and supervise the administration of the study
             medication.
