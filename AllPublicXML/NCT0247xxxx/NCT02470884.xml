      A prospective multi-center, single arm feasibility study to assess the safety and performance
      of the Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold is a device/drug combination product
      providing a mechanical structure for vascular lumen support (the scaffold component) and a
      pharmacological agent (everolimus) targeted toward reducing the injury response that leads to
      restenosis after scaffold implantation.

      The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold is intended to improve the luminal diameter
      in subjects with ischemic heart disease due to de novo native coronary artery target lesions
      ≤ 12 mm in length with reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.75 mm and ≤ 3.25 mm.

      Subjects who are candidates for PCI for the treatment of a de novo native coronary artery
      lesion will be screened according to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects
      will be considered enrolled once they have signed the informed consent form and an attempt
      has been made to implant the fully absorbable study scaffold.

      During the index procedure 1 target lesion in a de novo native coronary artery may be
      treated. Up to 1 non-target lesion in a separate epicardial vessel may be treated with a
      commercially approved DES
