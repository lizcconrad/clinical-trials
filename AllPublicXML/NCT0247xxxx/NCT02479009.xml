      Aim:

      The aim of this study is to analyze if fluoroscopy is as accurate as computed tomography in
      diagnosing displacement of acute scaphoid waist fractures.

      Primary null hypothesis:

      Fluoroscopy has comparable sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative
      predictive values compared with computed tomography for the diagnosis of displacement of
      acute scaphoid waist fractures.

      Secondary null hypothesis:

      All fractures diagnosed as non-displaced and treated without surgery are healed on
      radiographs and discharged from care within 6 months of injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The only confirmed risk factor for nonunion of a scaphoid waist fracture is displacement.
      There is consensus that displaced fractures should be treated with open or arthroscopically
      assisted reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). However, the optimal method to diagnose
      displacement is debated. Radiographic, computed tomography (CT), and arthroscopic diagnostic
      criteria for the diagnosis of displacement exist. There is no consensus regarding the imaging
      modality and measurements to use to diagnose scaphoid displacement. The definition of
      displacement in recent randomized trials is incompletely described and inconsistent.
      Fluoroscopy is more convenient, less expensive, and uses less radiation than CT scanning. If
      displaced fractures are unstable, then this should be apparent on fluoroscopy. The aim of
      this study is to analyze if fluoroscopy is as accurate as computed tomography in diagnosing
      displacement of acute scaphoid waist fractures.

    <description>The reference standard for calculation of diagnostic performance characteristics of fluoroscopy will be displacement on CT scanning defined as follows: Displacement on CT scan defined as any angulation or translation, or greater than 1mm gap at any point in the fracture line.</description>

    <description>Each patient will undergo fluoroscopy-imaging evaluation in the office to determine whether the fracture moves (instability). The investigators will deviate the wrist from ulnar to radial and back in posteroanterior, oblique and lateral views with the wrist in neutral flexion. Any angulation or translation at the fracture site or more than one millimeter displacement or gap will be considered as a sign of instability. The fluoroscopy will be viewed and an image showing the largest gap will be saved. The diagnosis of instability (which is the same as displacement with this test) will be made by consensus of the research team.</description>
