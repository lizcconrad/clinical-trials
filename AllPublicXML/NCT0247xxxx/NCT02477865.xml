    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study planning
      to include approximately 387 T2DM patients who have received at least 8 weeks of treatment
      with diet control and exercise； have not received any glucose-lowering agents within the 8
      weeks prior to screening; and have inadequately controlled blood glucose.The subjects would
      receive PEX168 or placebo monotherapy for 52weeks in total.

      This study consists of 4 periods： Period 1：Up to 3 weeks of screening period. Period 2：A
      4-week PEX168 dummy run-in period. Period 3：A 52-week treatment period (including a 24-week
      core treatment period and a 28-week extended treatment period).

      Period 4: A 4-week safety follow-up period. This study will last for approximately 63 weeks,
      including up to approximately 60 clinic visits.
