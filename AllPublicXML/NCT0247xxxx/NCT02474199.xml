    <textblock>
      This research study is for liver transplant recipients and their respective living donors.

      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To see if it is safe for liver recipients to receive one dose of donor reactive T
           regulatory cells (Tregs)

        2. To see if the Tregs allows a liver recipient to take less, or completely stop
           medications normally taken after receiving an organ transplant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doctors give drugs called immunosuppressants (IS) to people who receive a liver transplant.
      IS must be taken every day to prevent the body from injuring the transplanted liver by a
      process called rejection. Liver transplant recipients usually have to take these drugs for
      the rest of their lives. These drugs have harmful side effects. Researchers are looking for
      ways to keep a transplanted liver working normally with as little IS medications as possible.
      Finding a way to lower and then stop these medications will allow the liver recipient to
      avoid unwanted side effects.

      Another area of research looks at how blood cells work to reject or accept an organ
      transplant. Studies show that some of the recipient's own cells, called T regulatory cells
      (Tregs), may play a part in accepting the transplanted liver and preventing rejection.

      A recipient's Tregs can be grown in the laboratory to increase their number. Exposing the
      recipient's Tregs to the liver donor's cells will stimulate the Tregs that recognize the
      liver donor to grow vigorously. Giving these &quot;donor reactive&quot; Tregs back to the transplant
      recipient through a vein (intravenously) might allow a liver transplant recipient to take
      lower doses of IS, or perhaps to stop them altogether, without rejecting the liver.

      The study team will collect information about the Treg infusion, liver tests and drug doses
      during IS withdrawal, and any problems that may arise in the study. Blood, liver tissue, and
      buccal (cheek) cells will be collected for research tests.
