  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the result of straight versus coiled Tenckhoff catheters for peritoneal
      dialysis patients. Recent meta-analysis of the peritoneal dialysis catheter type was in favor
      of straight catheters. The effects of straight versus coiled peritoneal dialysis catheters,
      however, are unclear. The investigators design an adequately powered randomized controlled
      study to evaluate the two types of double-cuffed peritoneal dialysis catheters. The primary
      objective is to assess whether straight peritoneal dialysis catheters can reduce the risk of
      catheter dysfunction that requires intervention. The investigators estimate that they would
      need to enroll 132 incident peritoneal dialysis patients in each group for the study to have
      80% power to detect a difference between 7% and 15% in the primary endpoint of catheter
      dysfunction requiring intervention.

      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the a priori hypothesis that straight
      peritoneal dialysis catheters would improve the treatment outcomes of peritoneal dialysis.
      The early and late catheter complications, as well as catheter survival, will be compared
      between peritoneal dialysis patients who are randomized to straight and coiled Tenckhoff
      catheters.
