    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      Hemay022. The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Hemay022 in the
      treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part one, trial will be conducted in 18-30 subjects
      to determine safety and tolerability of Hemay022 in patients with HER2-positive advanced
      breast cancer. Part two, approximately 27 additional subjects with HER2-positive advanced
      breast cancer, are included to better define the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      Hemay022.

      This is a phaseⅠsequential-group study of ascending single and multiple oral doses
      administered to subjects with HER2-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer. Each subject will receive
      a single dose of Hemay022, followed by a 1-week observation period, and then will receive
      Hemay022 administered once daily by mouth for 28 days. Each cycle consist of 28 days.
      Subjects will be enrolled in groups of 3 to 6. Depending on the safety and activity profile
      observed during the dose escalation phase, the dose selected for Part 2 may be adjusted. Part
      2 is an extension part of three dose groups.
