  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-3641 (short ragweed
      [Ambrosia artemisiifolia] extract, MK-3641, SCH 039641, RAGWITEK™) sublingual immunotherapy
      tablets in children aged 5 to 17 years with ragweed-induced allergic
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma. The primary hypothesis of this study is
      that administration of MK-3641 sublingual immunotherapy tablets to children 5 to 17 years of
      age, compared with placebo, will result in a significant reduction in rhinoconjunctivitis
      symptoms and medication use over the peak ragweed season (RS).

             rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis of ≥1 year (at least 1 season for ages 4 to 6 years) or
             ≥2 years (at least 2 seasons for ages 7 to 17 years) duration diagnosed by a physician
             (with or without asthma) and have received treatment for the condition during the
             previous ragweed season

          -  If female, agrees to remain abstinent or use (or have their partner use) an acceptable
             method of birth control within the projected duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a clinical history of symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis (and/or asthma) due

          -  Has a clinical history of significant symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or
             asthma due to an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed during the ragweed
             season which would interfere with assessment of the treatment effect

          -  Has any nasal condition that could confound the efficacy or safety assessments (e.g.,
             nasal polyposis).

          -  Has asthma requiring high daily doses of inhaled corticosteroids within the 6 months

             deterioration of asthma that resulted in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to
             asthma, or treatment with systemic corticosteroids (but allowing short-acting beta
             agonists) at any time within the last 3 months prior to the Screening or Randomization
             Visits

          -  Has current severe atopic dermatitis

          -  Has a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to the ingredients of the
             study drug (except for Ambrosia artemisiifolia), rescue medications, or
