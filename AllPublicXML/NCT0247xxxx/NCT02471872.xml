    <textblock>
      The BREATHE (Behavioral Research of Environment and Air Pollution Through Education) study is
      a pilot randomized control trial comparing the efficacy of a classroom-based intervention to
      no intervention in helping middle-school students understand and make behavioral decisions
      about air pollution. This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      classroom-based intervention on knowledge of air pollution, understanding of air pollution
      sources, and behavioral choices made to reduce both contributions to air pollution and
      personal exposure to air pollution.

      It has been well established that pollution is a racial and economic issue. Low-income areas
      with populations of predominantly people of color tend to be those with the highest rates of
      pollution and the largest particulate exposure. Creation of and exposure to this pollution is
      a key issue for the health of inhabitants of these areas, and of those in the broader
      surrounding areas. By developing, and assessing the effectiveness of, the investigators hope
      that the BREATHE study will give the investigators insights into how to better combat this
      higher exposure and reduce the health risks for those in high pollution areas.

      The study will take place in 4 visits over a period of 12 months. The hypothesis is that the
      classroom-based intervention will be effective in leading to behaviors that will reduce
      exposure to air pollution.
