  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to show that the investigators believe the Modified Brostrӧm Procedure (MBP)
      can be completed without a routine ankle arthroscopy. Routine ankle arthroscopy, if
      determined not to be necessary in all cases, is a waste of resources in terms of operating
      room, surgeon, and staff time as well causing an increase in hospital financial expenses.
      Most importantly, this procedure is morbid. Ankle arthroscopy forces a patient's foot into
      distraction for up to one hour, exposes the patient to potentially longer anesthesia exposure
      that is unnecessary, increases infectious risks, and requires exposure at the portal sites
      near superficial nerves.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine if ankle arthroscopy is necessary in the
      treatment of routine ankle instability without evidence of intra-articular pathology on MRI.
      Our study population will include those individuals whose ankle MRI is inconclusive or
      negative for intra-articular pathologies, and intra-articular ankle pain is not a predominant
      presenting symptom. Although it is our current practice at WBAMC not to conduct an ankle
      arthroscopy on this group of patients, there is a debate in the literature on whether the
      arthroscopy should be conducted. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the MBP with
      and without ankle arthroscopy.

    <description>the angle formed by the tibial plafond and talar dome is measured as inversion force is applied to the hindfoot at 10-20 degrees of plantarflexion. A tilt of 0-23 degrees is considered normal though most ankles measure 0-5 degrees.</description>

    <description>a test in which a patient is seated with the knee flexed, and the tibia is fixed with one hand while the ankle is grasped with the other hand, plantarflexed 10 degrees, and the talus is translated anteriorly under fluoroscopy. The degree of translation in mm is measured. To put this in perspective, a translation of &gt;8mm is considered diagnostic for an anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) tear.</description>

    <arm_group_label>MBP plus ankle arthroscopy (Group A)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group A will receive a diagnostic ankle arthroscopy followed by the Modified Brostrӧm Procedure (MBP). In the ankle arthroscopy, multiple pictures are taken inside of the joint to note possible pathologic processes (for example - osteochondral lesions of the talus). Ankle arthroscopy involves one incision in the middle of the ankle anteriomedial (middle) incision and one incision on the outside of the ankle. Each incision (a small cut in the skin) is roughly 5mm in length (which is about 0.2 inches). After the incision is made, the participant will receive a diagnostic ankle arthroscopy.If the surgeon detects an abnormality inside the joint, he will operate on the abnormality with the arthroscope according to the generally accepted principles for treating the abnormality.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>MBP alone (Group B)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group B will receive sham skin incisions on the ankle a Modified Brostrӧm Procedure (MBP) alone (that is, there will be no diagnostic ankle arthroscopy) followed by the Modified Brostrӧm Procedure (MBP). If a participant is assigned to Group B, the participant will receive two small superficial skin incisions at the sites where the investigators would normally insert instruments for the ankle arthroscopy. As with Group A, there will be one anteriomedial (middle) incision on the middle of the ankle and one anteriolateral (side) incision to on the outside of the ankle. Each incision will be roughly 5mm in length and 5 mm in depth, but will not violate subcutaneous tissue. The width of these incisions will be the width of the blade, at 1mm. However, unlike Group A, the participants in Group B will not have any instruments inserted into their ankle and will not have any operation to repair or remove damaged tissue.</description>
