  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-site, randomized-read order, retrospective, paired-design evaluation of the Omnyx™
      Integrated Digital Pathology (IDP) system with de-identified and previously signed-out cases
      from all major organ systems. Pathologist will read and diagnose cases on a conventional
      light microscope and on the Omnyx™ IDP system for Whole Slide Images (WSI) with a randomized
      read order. College of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocol checklists will be used to
      capture diagnostic reporting.

      Diagnoses rendered by site Reading Pathologists will be captured on CAP checklists and
      compared directly to the Ground Truth (GT) diagnosis for both modalities.

      Following the FDA issued guidance document, &quot;Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device
      Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable&quot;- 2006, the
      specimens are surgical pathology samples from leftover human specimens from clinical cases,
      archived and previously signed-out across the majority of surgical pathology subspecialties

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        • All surgical pathology samples from pre-identified list provided by FDA

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Gross evaluation only specimens (including hardware and specimens that do not require
             microscopic review for diagnosis)

          -  Immunofluorescence specimens

          -  Fluid-based specimens

          -  Intraoperative consultation specimens only (frozen preparation)

          -  Specimens from which a slide(s) fails quality control according to user manuals and
             training and issue(s) cannot be remediated at the time of procurement and
             over-labeling; this includes having too many labels such that slide damage or scanner
             failure is likely (as outlined in Omnyx user manuals).

          -  Specimens for which any slide (other than a blank) that should be in the case part
             cannot be located
