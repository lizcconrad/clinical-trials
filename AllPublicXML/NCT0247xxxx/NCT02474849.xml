        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior to study start, subjects must be daily users of newer generation e-cigarette
             devices which they have used regularly for a minimum of three months. The solutions
             used in their e-cigarettes must contain nicotine. Subjects must also be occasional
             smokers of combustible cigarettes (lower limit of 1 cigarette per month; upper limit
             of 5 cigarettes per week). Product use status will be confirmed with a urinary
             cotinine level of â‰¥200ng/ml (determined using NicAlert cotinine test kit) at
             screening.

          2. Subjects will be males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, and between 21 and 55
             years of age inclusive. Age verification will be performed by checking of Federal or
             state-issued ID (e.g. passport or driving licence) during screening.

          3. Women of child-bearing potential should be using one of the following acceptable
             methods of contraception : combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) oral,
             intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation; progestogen-only hormonal contraception, either oral, injected or
             implanted, associated with inhibition of ovulation; progestogen-only oral hormonal
             contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action;
             intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral
             tubal occlusion; male or female condom with or without spermicide; cap, diaphragm or
             sponge with spermicide.

          4. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically
             sterile (hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy) or postmenopausal for more than 1 year and
             must have a negative urine pregnancy test result during screening. Women who are
             surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative report.

          5. Male subjects must use an approved method of birth control during the entire study.
             These subjects must not donate sperm during this time.

          6. Subjects must be in good health as determined by medical history, vital signs, blood
             biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis and physical examination.

          7. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive. Male
             subjects must have a weight between 60 and 120kg and female subjects between 50 and
             100kg.

          8. No clinically significant abnormalities in blood pressure values.

          9. Subjects will have negative results for the urinary drug of abuse screening and
             ethanol test.

         10. Subjects will have given their written informed consent to participate in the study
             and to abide by the study restrictions.

        To be confirmed during each clinic visit:

        1. Abstinence from tobacco and nicotine products will be confirmed by an exhaled breath CO
        reading &lt;10ppm.

         12. Female subjects, who are pregnant or become pregnant during the course of the study.

         13. Subjects who have lost or donated more than 450ml of blood within the 3 months
