      This is a multicentre, observational, descriptive estimate of the proportion of participants
      with psoriatic arthritis among psoriasis participants attending dermatology clinics selected
      for this study. In addition, this study will involve full psychometric assessment of the
      Early psoriatic screening questionnaire (EARP) questionnaire with the aim of identifying and
      appropriately referring participants to a rheumatologist for review if their EARP score is 3
      or greater at Screening (i.e. &gt;= 3 at Visit 1).
