  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      The number of breast cancer (BC) patients at risk for long-term radiation-induced health
      problems is increasing, as their outcome is improving due to intensified treatment regimens,
      such as new systemic approaches and radiotherapy. Therefore, identifying BC survivors with
      the highest risk for radiation-induced health problems is crucial for developing strategies
      for primary and secondary prevention, which may contribute to healthy ageing.
