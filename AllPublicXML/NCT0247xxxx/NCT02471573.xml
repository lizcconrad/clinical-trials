      All patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) will be treated with GnRH antagonist
      protocol. Recombinant Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be given on day 2 or day 3 of
      menstrual cycle for 5 days. The starting dose is individualized for each patient based on the
      following criteria: Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) &lt; 0.7 ng/ml, dose 300 IU/day, AMH 0.7 -2.1
      ng/ml, dose 225 IU/day, AMH &gt; 2.1 ng/ml, dose 150 IU/day. After that, investigators can
      titrate the dose based on their clinical judgment. Follicular development will be monitored
      by ultrasound scanning and measurement of estradiol, progesterone starting on day 5 of
      stimulation. Scanning and hormonal measurement will be repeated every 2 to 3 days, depending
      on the size of follicles. Antagonist is routinely used on day 5 until the day of Human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Criteria for recombinant hCG (6,500 IU) administration is the
      presence of at least three leading follicles of 17 mm. Oocyte retrieval is performed 36 hours
      after recombinant hCG administration.

      We will measure progesterone levels during stimulation on the day 5 and day 7, as well as on
      the day of oocyte triggering.

      Insemination will be performed by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, 3 - 4 hours after
      oocyte retrieval. Only matured oocytes are inseminated. Fertilization are performed under
      inverted microscope at period of 16-18 hours after insemination.

      On day 3, endometrium thickness will be measured and embryo evaluation will be performed at
      fixed time point 68±1 hours after fertilization, using Istanbul consensus. After grading
      embryo, eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study. Written consent will
      be obtained from each patient for participation into the study. Patients will be randomized
      into 2 groups fresh embryo transfer and freeze-all. Randomization will be done by third party
      via telephone, using a computer-generated random list, with block size of 2, 4, 8.

      Study Procedures

      Freeze all group

      All grade 1 and grade 2 embryos were cryopreserved using vitrification method. In the next
      cycle, endometrium will be prepared by using estradiol orally, starting from day 2-3 of
      menstrual cycle. When endometrium thickness reaches 8mm or more, patients start to use
      progesterone vaginally. Embryo transfer is performed 3 days after using progesterone. On the
      day of embryo transfer, maximum two embryos will be thawed. Two hours after thawing,
      surviving embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. Luteal-phase
      support is done with estradiol 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day until 7th week of
      gestation.

      Fresh ET group

      In fresh ET group, maximum 2 embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound
      guidance. The remain grade 1 and 2 embryos will be frozen. Luteal phase support is done with
      estradiol 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day until 7th week of gestation.

      In both of groups, serum hCG was measured 2 weeks after embryo transferred, and if positive,
      an ultrasound scan of the uterus was performed at gestational weeks 7 and 12.

      METHODS

      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION

      At IVFMD, the current ongoing pregnancy rate (with 2 embryos transferred) is 30%. To show an
      improvement in the freeze-all group of 10% (from 30% to 40%), it was calculated that 712
      couples (356 in each group) would be needed (power 0.80, alpha-error 5%, two-sided test). To
      account for an estimated loss to follow-up rate of 10%, the number of patients needed was
      defined as 780 (390 patients per group).

      STUDY ENDPOINTS

      Primary endpoint

      Ongoing pregnancy (OP). Ongoing pregnancy is explained as a pregnancy with positive heart
      beat beyond 12 weeks of gestation (twins is count as a single pregnancy).

      Labor

      Induction of labor

        -  Cesarean section

             -  Elective

             -  Suspected fetal distress

             -  Non-progressive labor

        -  Vaginal instrumental delivery

             -  Non-progressive labor

        -  Peripartum increased blood loss (≥1000 mL)

      SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT A review of patient information should be done prior to enrolment to
      determine preliminary eligibility according to patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. When
      a patient signs an informed consent she is considered to be enrolled in the study.

      WITHDRAWAL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS Patients can leave the study at any time for any reason if
      they wish to do so without any consequences for their treatment. The investigator can decide
      to withdraw a subject from the study or urgent medical reasons.

      STATISTICAL EVALUATION

      Event rates will be calculated for dichotomous endpoints. These will be compared by
      calculating relative risk and 95% confidence interval values. Between-group differences in
      non-continuous variables will be assessed using the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables
      will be reported as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) or as percentages. Between-group
      differences in continuous variables will be assessed with the Student's t-test.

      In a secondary analysis we will assess whether the biomarkers progesterone at triggering day
      and endometrial thickness on day 3 after oocyte pick up can be used to identify patients in
      whom the freeze all strategy is particularly effective. To do so, we will look for
      interaction between progesterone or endometrial thickness and treatment effect.

      A p-value &lt;0.05 is defined as indicating a statistically significant difference. The analysis
      will be done with R statistical package (R version 3.3.1).

      INTERIM ANALYSIS

      Interim analysis will be performed after recruitment of the first 400 patients. An
      independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will evaluate the data. A specific
      stopping rule will not be formulated, but continuation of the study will depend on the advice
      of the DSMC.

      SAFETY REPORTING

      The investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited medical research
      ethics committee; if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages
      of participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The
      investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.

      ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of
      treatment group or suspected causal relationship to intervention, will be recorded. Adverse
      events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical
      trial, whether or not considered related to the intervention. All adverse events reported
      spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staffs will be recorded.

      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results
      in death;

        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);

        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation;

        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;

        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;

        -  is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an
           unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction.

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT The subject should be given the time to read and understand the
      statement herself before signing her consent and dating the document. The subject should
      receive a copy of the written statement once signed.

      PRIVACY ASPECTS Participating subjects will be registered by a 5-digit number. This personal
      code will be on all forms retrieved from participants.

      BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT, GROUP RELATEDNESS There is insufficient evidence for a
      rational policy in between the 2 strategies, freeze all or fresh ET. The potential benefits
      of freeze all are higher pregnancy rate, with a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome (OHSS) and/or ectopic pregnancy. The potential harm would be time-consuming.
