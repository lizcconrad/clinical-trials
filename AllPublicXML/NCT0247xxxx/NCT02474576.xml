    <textblock>
      The efficiency of percutaneous aponeurotomy in the treatment of Dupuytrens disease is well
      known. However, the duration of the clinical improvement after aponeurotomy is not well
      known.

      This study aims primarily at measuring the incidence rate of local relapse of
      Dupuytrens-induced finger flessum, within two years following treatment by percutaneous
      aponeurotomy in Dupuytrens.

    <description>the statistical unit is the finger treated by aponeurotomy (we expect an average of 2 fingers treated for one patient included). Local relapse is defined as the recurrence of a finger flessum superior by 20° to the articular range initially obtained after aponeurotomy</description>

    <description>The finger(s) with limited extension due to Dupuytrens disease and for which the patient desires treatment, will be treated by fine-needle percutaneous aponeurotomy under local anesthesia (outpatient procedure). This procedure is already routinely used in clinical practice ; our study aims at better describing the time-sustainability of its benefits.</description>
