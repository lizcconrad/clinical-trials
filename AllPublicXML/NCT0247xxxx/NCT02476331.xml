  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by extreme changes in mood and emotion dysregulation.
      Mood changes are episodic in nature, with distinct periods of mania, depression, and
      asymptomatic periods of euthymia. In addition to impairments in mood, cognitive impairments
      are a common feature of the disorder. These cognitive impairments persist during periods of
      euthymia and are associated with negative clinical and psychosocial outcomes. Specifically,
      individuals with BD show impairments in executive functions. Recent studies show that emotion
      regulation can be down-regulated by taxing executive functions, and it can be improved with
      working memory training, a specific component of executive functions. These initial studies
      show that emotion regulation is under executive control in healthy individuals; however, the
      nature of this relationship is not well understood in populations that are affected by
      impairments in both executive control and emotion regulation. Previous work on cognitive
      training has not targeted specific cognitive domains with an emphasis on understanding the
      underlying mechanisms that promote change. Moreover, well-controlled randomized control trial
      (RCT) studies are needed in order to provide high quality evidence to inform the efficacy of
      cognitive training interventions for psychiatric populations. The aim of the proposed study
      is to use a commercially available cognitive training program to study the effects of working
      memory training on cognitive, clinical, and psychosocial outcomes in patients with BD. We
      hypothesize that training working memory will lead to improvements in cognitive and emotional
      functioning, leading to downstream changes that will positively impact untrained outcomes,
      such as mood and community functioning.

    <description>The neurocognitive training program will be provided by an online platform called BrainGymmer (https://www.braingymmer.com/en/brain-games/). The experimental group will complete the working memory training, which involves three games: N-back, Multi-Memory, and Moving Memory. These games are designed to engage processes involving updating and manipulation of information. All of the training games provided by BrainGymmer are adaptive, meaning that the level of difficulty increases as users develop expertise on a given task. Participants randomized to the cognitive training arm will complete the training games for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week, for a total of 10 weeks.</description>
