    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, two-arm, dose-escalation exploratory
      pilot clinical trial involving HIV-1 infected participants treated with suppressive
      combination antiretroviral combination therapy (cART). The study will test whether combined
      treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the immunomodulatory
      cytokine Interferon-alpha2a can reduce the residual reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells that
      persist during treatment with currently available antiretroviral drugs.

      This study is a prospective, double-arm, randomized, open-label, dose-escalation exploratory
      clinical trial involving HIV-1 infected participants treated with suppressive combination
      antiretroviral combination therapy (cART). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate
      a new strategy for reducing the residual reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells that persists
      despite treatment with current HIV drugs. The clinical trial is conducted in the Infectious
      Diseases Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

      The study medication includes two agents: Panobinostat is an oral tablet that can reverse
      HIV-1 latency and awaken HIV from a &quot;sleeping&quot; condition during which it is protected from
      the human immune system. The second drug is interferon-alpha2a, an injectable cytokine that
      activates the immune system. The combined use of both agents may lead to immune-mediated
      elimination of HIV-1 infected cells in which viral latency has been reversed by panobinostat.

      All participants will receive one week of treatment with panobinostat (10mg, dosed every
      second day on Monday, Wednesday, Friday), followed by three weeks off-treatment. Participants
      will be randomized to receive this treatment course with panobinostat alone (Arm A, 2
      participants total), or in combination with pegylated IFN-alpha2a (Arm B, 6 participants
      total). Subcutaneous injections with pegylated Interferon-alpha2a will be administered at the
      start of the week-long treatment course, simultaneously with the first dose of panobinostat.
      ART will be continued during the entire treatment duration in all study participants.

      Participants will undergo close monitoring for side effects during the entire time of study
      participation. The total study duration will be 2 months.
