      It is a single-arm, open label clinical trial. Patients affected by relapsed or refractory
      small-cell lung cancer patients with MGMT promoter methylation are included in this study;
      they will be treated with oral Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 die for 5 consecutive days every 28
      days. Treatment will be continued until tumor progression, intolerable toxicity or patient
      refusal.

      A Minimax Simon 2-stage design will be used. - First stage: 9 patients If 1 or less responses
      will be observed, the trial will be ended.- Second stage: other 10 patients (for a total of
      19 subjects enrolled) If 5 or less responses will be observed in 19 patients, the treatment
      will not be considered active, while if 6 or more responses will be observed, the treatment
      will be considered sufficiently active to warrant further testing. Since the rate of
      methylation ranges from 20 to 48% the number of patients to be screened should be between 40
      and 95.

      The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate [ORR = CR + PR]; the
      secondary objectives are to determine the time to Progression (TTP), the overall Survival
      (OS), the toxicity and the correlation between response Rate (RR) and the level of MGMT
      promoter methylation and/or base excision repair (BER) genes alterations.

      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study. Patients must have histologically or
      cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), both limited or extensive disease,
      relapsed after one or two prior chemotherapy regimens MGMT promoter methylation status will
      be evaluated on a histological tissue sample (after patient signature of a specific informed
      consent form for this biological evaluation) using Pyrosequencing technique and the main 10
      CpG islands of MGMT promoter will be studied. Only patients with MGMT promoter methylation
      will be enrolled in the clinical trial. To be eligible patients may have received 1 or 2
      prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients with brain metastases may be enrolled.

      Patients will be informed about the palliative nature of the treatment . Patients will be
      treated with oral Temozolomide 200 mg/m2/die for 5 consecutive days .

      Treatment will be repeated every 28 days and continued until disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity or patient refusal.

      Response to chemotherapy will be monitored every three cycles by CT scan of the chest and the
      abdomen and computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the whole brain.
      Response to treatment will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

      In case of progressive disease (PD) the patients will discontinue treatment. In case of
      stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) patients continue
      treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or patient refusal.

      After the end of treatment, if disease progression will not occur, patients will be evaluated
      every 3 months by CT scan of the chest and the abdomen and CT scan or RM of the whole brain
      until disease progression.

      Planned follow-up visits will continue until disease progression and patients will be
      monitored for survival and toxicity .
