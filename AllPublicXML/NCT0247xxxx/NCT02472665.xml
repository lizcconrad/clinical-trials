        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with severe hereditary von Willebrand's disease (VWF:RCof&lt;20 IU/dl)
             type 1, 2 or 3, independent of prior treatment

          2. Patients less than 6 years of age

          3. Patients that do not adequately respond to treatment with desmopressin

          4. Positive anti-HBs and anti-HAV antibodies due to prior exposure or vaccination. If
             negative, vaccination to hepatitis A and B with be initiated before the first infusion
             of Fanhdi®

          5. Signed informed consent by the patient's legal representative (mother, father o tutor)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has been diagnosed of acquired VWD

          2. Patients bleeding at the time of the first infusion or the 10 days prior to the
             infusion

          3. Subjects treated with desmopressin or another VWF containing FVIII concentrate during
             the 5 days prior to the infusion of the investigational product

          4. The subject is known or suspected to have present or past inhibitor activity
             (antibodies) directed against FVIII or VWF

          5. The subject is known to have history of intolerance to any Fanhdi® containing
             substance

          6. The subject is known to have history of anaphylactic reaction(s) to blood or blood
             components

          7. Subjects presenting severe platelet dysfunctions due to drugs (aspirin, other NSAIDs,
             etc.) or other pathologies (uremic thrombopathy, hematological diseases)

          8. Immunocompromised subjects or HIV positive that have less than 400 CD4+/microliters, a
             viral load &gt;400 copies/ml, platelet count lower than 100x10e9/l, present any
             additional factor that elevates the risk of bleeding or that have a life expectancy
             less than 1 year

          9. Subjects presenting anemia (hemoglobulin &lt;11 g/dl)

         10. Subjects diagnosed with metabolic diseases that are not clinically controlled, such as
             diabetes mellitus, that could potentially interfere with the interpretations of the
             study

         11. The subject is participating in another clinical study involving an investigational
             treatment, or participated within the past month

         12. If it is anticipated that the subject will be treated with other products containing
             FVIII or VWF different from Fanhdi® during a period of one year

         13. The subject is unlikely to adhere to the protocol requirements of the study

         14. Any subject that does not dispose of a frozen plasma sample prior to the first
             infusion of Fanhdi®
