    <textblock>
      Comparative randomized, single dose, two-way crossover open-label study to determine the
      bioequivalence of Rabeprazole from Idiazole 20mg DR tabs (GSK, Egypt)and PARIET 20 mg DR tabs
      (JANSSEN, EGYPT) after a single oral dose administration of each to healthy adults under
      fasting conditions.

      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic
      Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the
      90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for
      untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e. The confidence intervals of logarithmically
      transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.

    <measure>Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (t) (AUC [0 to t])</measure>

    <measure>Area Under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC [0 to infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 hours post dose in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 to infinity) will be calculated as the sum of the AUC (0 to t) plus the ratio of the last measurable plasma concentration to the elimination rate constant</description>

    <measure>Time of the maximum plasma concentration (tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 hours post dose in each treatment period</time_frame>

    <measure>Apparent first-order elimination or terminal rate constant (K¬e)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 hours post dose in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>K¬e will be calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter will be calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the last three (or more) non-zero plasma concentrations</description>
