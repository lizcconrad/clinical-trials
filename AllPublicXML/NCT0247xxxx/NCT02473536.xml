    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiographic evidence of renal cancer with IVC tumor thrombus

          -  Tumor thrombus must be ≥ level II

          -  Patient eligible for SABR to the IVC tumor thrombus as decided by the treating
             radiation oncologist

          -  Patient eligible for IVC tumor thrombectomy as decided by the treating urologist

          -  Any number of metastatic disease is allowed in the Pilot phase of the trial

               -  For the Phase II, metastatic patients will be allowed only if all sites of
                  metastasis has been treated either surgically or radio-surgically

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Performance status ECOG 0-2

          -  Any serum Albumin is allowed, but ≥ 3.4 g/dL is strongly encouraged

          -  Any serum AST is allowed but serum AST ≤ 34 IU/L is strongly encouraged

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Subjects must be able to undergo either a contrast enhanced MRI or CT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had radiotherapy to a target within 3 cm of the IVC tumor thrombus.

          -  Subjects may have received any other investigational agents or chemotherapy as long as
             they are eligible for SABR and surgery

          -  Subjects with brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial unless all
             the metastasis are treated surgically or radio-surgically

          -  Subjects with a history of pulmonary embolism is excluded

          -  Subjects with a history of pulmonary hypertension is excluded

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant due to the potential for congenital abnormalities.

          -  Surgery or SABR of metastatic site concurrently or at any time is allowed

          -  Contraindication for contrast-enhanced MRI as defined by the standard operating
             procedures of the Department of Radiology at UT Southwestern. Briefly, these include
             medically unstable; cardiac pacemaker; intracranial clips, metal implants; metal in
             the eyes; pregnant or nursing; claustrophobia; and impairment of the renal function
             with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2.
