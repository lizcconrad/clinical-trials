    <textblock>
      This trial will examine the safety and feasibility of using the OrganOx Metra device to
      transport and store donor livers under normothermic conditions prior to transplantation.
      Participants will be followed for 3 months following transplantation and their outcomes
      recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is a life-saving procedure but its success has been limited by a
      shortage of suitable donor organs. Much emphasis is now placed on optimising the condition of
      those organs that are available, to enable more higher risk organs to be transplanted safely.
      An effective means of pre-transplant viability assessment would not only allow greater use of
      higher risk donors but also minimise the risk of primary non-function by identifying and
      excluding non-viable organs before subjecting a patient to the risk of surgery. Organ storage
      under normothermic perfusion conditions enables organ function to be evaluated prior to
      transplantation and further has been shown to prevent organ injury which is sustained during
      standard cold storage. This trial will examine the safety and feasibility of using the
      OrganOx Metra device to transport and store donor livers under normothermic conditions prior
      to transplantation. This study will evaluate liver function post-transplantation using
      standard clinical parameters. Participants will be followed for 3 months following
      transplantation and their outcomes recorded. Participants will undergo no other study
      procedures. Feasibility will be measured using the ratio of actual / eligible candidate
      donors recruited to the study and will also encompass logistical issues with respect to
      transportation, and ease of use. Safety will be assessed by rates of device failures
      resulting in organ discard, primary graft non-function, re-transplantation, and recipient
      death.
