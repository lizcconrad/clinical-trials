  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, sequential, single-center study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics
      of digoxin when coadministered with PEX168 in healthy adult subjects. The total duration of
      each subject's participation in the study was approximately 12 weeks, which included up to a
      14-day Screening Period, a 44-day Treatment Period, and an approximately 4-week Follow-up
      Period.

      Center: This study was conducted at a single site in the first affiliate hospital of Xi'an
      Jiaotong University.All subjects receives a single 0.5mg oral dose of digoxin on Day 1
      followed by 5 weekly 200μg doses of PEX168 injected subcutaneously beginning on Day 8 and a
      second single 0.5mg oral dose of digoxin on Day 38.
