  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Gene therapy is a way to treat or prevent disease using genes. It is monitored very closely
      by regulators because there can be long-term, unexpected side effects. NIH is required to try
      to contact people who have been treated with gene therapy at least annually for up to 15
      years. This is to see if they have had any bad side effects. This trial does not include any
      therapy and is only for patients previously treated on gene-therapy trials at the NCI
      Experimental Transplantation an Immunology Branch who are no longer enrolled on their
      original gene therapy clinical trial.

      Objective:

      - To collect of long-term follow-up data on people who have been in gene transfer studies.
      This follow-up is required by regulators.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 18 and older who have been in a previous NCI Experimental Transplantation and
      Immunology Branch gene therapy research study.

      Design:

        -  After they get the genetically modified cells, participants will:

        -  Have blood drawn 3, 6, and 12 months later.

        -  Have an annual clinic visit for the next 4 years. They will have a physical exam. They
           will answer questions about any signs of neurological, autoimmune, or blood disorders,
           or any new cancers. Blood &lt;TAB&gt;may be drawn.

        -  Be called or emailed annually for the next 10 years. They will answer health questions.
           Blood samples may need to be taken.

        -  Participants will be asked for their current address and phone number. They will also be
           asked for the address and phone number of 1 or 2 people who will know their whereabouts.
           One of these should be a family member if possible,

        -  At the time of the participant s death, researchers will request permission from their
           family for an autopsy.

      Background:

      The NCI ETIB Branch conducts clinical trials utilizing gene transfer. The current FDA
      requirements for long term follow up may be up to fifteen years for some products. As this
      time period is frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a protocol is
      necessary to ensure the necessary follow up of these subjects

      Objectives:

      To facilitate collection of long term follow up information on subjects who have participated
      in gene transfer studies as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other
      regulatory groups

      Eligibility:

      Enrollment on a NCI ETIB treatment protocol for gene therapy.

      Design:

      Patients will undergo physical exams, laboratory evaluation or phone follow up as required by
      the treatment protocol and/or as clinically indicated.
