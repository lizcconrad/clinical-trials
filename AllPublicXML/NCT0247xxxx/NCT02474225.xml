  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of additional fluid into the vitreous cavity by intravitreal therapy would
      be expected to cause an immediate rise in the intraocular pressure. This transient,
      short-term intraocular pressure elevation (lasting up to 30 minutes) after intravitreal
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy has been well describe. The investigators aim
      to study the prevalence of the sustained intraocular pressure elevation associated with
      intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents are commonly used
      to treat a variety of retinal and choroidal neovascular diseases. The introduction of
      additional fluid into the vitreous cavity by intravitreal therapy would be expected to cause
      an immediate rise in the intraocular pressure.

      Although there is one study showed no significant changes in the intraocular pressure many
      retrospective studies showed the impacts on the intraocular pressure elevation. The
      investigators aim to prospective evaluate the intraocular pressure change in non-glaucomatous
      patients receiving an intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.
