      We are trying to determine the therapeutic effect of the music glove and conventional hand
      exercise program to patients with spinal cord injuries. All participants will be randomized
      into two groups: AB and BA. They will all exercise at least 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a
      minimal 3 hours exercise time per week. Participants will receive the other intervention at
      their 3 week post therapy follow up visits. Clinical evaluations will be performed at
      baseline 1 and 2 (3 to 10 days apart), post therapy after first intervention, 3-week post
      therapy follow up, post therapy after second intervention, and 3-week post second
      intervention follow up visits.

    <description>Music Glove is a glove with sensors attached to the tips of all 5 fingers. The glove is connected to a software musical program like guitar hero. Participants will follow the rhythm or musical notes of the songs and move their fingers accordingly. Participants are reinforced with biofeedback that includes visual and auditory cues when the correct sequences are achieved.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Conventional Hand Exercise Program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Conventional Hand Exercise Program includes range of motion exercises, strengthening exercises, coordinating exercises of the hand and fingers. This exercise program is designed by an occupational therapist and is a general exercise program that a stroke patient will receive when he/she is being discharged from the hospital.</description>
