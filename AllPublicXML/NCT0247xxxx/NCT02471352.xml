  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Skin disease can have many causes. It can have widespread consequences, and in rare cases
      can lead to death. Researchers want to determine the causes of various types of skin diseases
      and find a way to treat them.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the causes of various skin diseases and find ways to treat them.

      Eligibility:

        -  People ages 2 and older who have:

             -  A skin disease or at risk of developing a skin disease OR

             -  A family member of persons with a skin disease

        -  Healthy volunteers ages 2 and older

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.

        -  Participants may take a survey about how their skin condition affects their quality of
           life.

        -  Participants will have a medical history and a physical exam including a detailed skin
           exam. Pictures will be taken of their skin to document any skin disease.

        -  Participants will have specimens collected. This may include:

             -  Several teaspoons of blood taken at each visit

             -  Stool samples

             -  Nail and body fluid (like saliva) samples

             -  Cheek swabs. The inside of the cheek will be scraped for about a minute in each
                direction to collect cells.

             -  Collection of skin samples with:

                  -  A swab (like a Q-tip)

                  -  Gently scraping skin to remove the outer layers of cells

                  -  Applying and removing 1-inch pieces of tape

        -  Participants may have up to 4 skin biopsies in 12 months, with 4 separate biopsies taken
           each time.

             -  An area of skin will be numbed with an injection.

             -  A piece of skin the size of a pencil eraser will be removed using a small
                instrument.

             -  A flat scar usually develops at the biopsy site.

      Background:

        -  Skin diseases represent one of the most common medical problems in the-United States,
           affecting 1 in 3 people at any given time.

        -  Complex interactions between genetic background and the environment are-relevant to
           understanding skin disease.

        -  By studying dermatoses, we may gain insight into the complex host
           environment-interactions that give rise to or exacerbate these skin-conditions, and into
           links between inflammation and cancer.

      Objective:

      -To procure biologic samples for exploratory cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic
      biological studies from subjects with dermatologic conditions, subjects at risk for
      developing dermatologic conditions and healthy volunteers in the support of NIH biomedical
      studies

      Eligibility:

      -Subjects with or at risk for developing dermatologic diseases, family members of subjects
      with dermatologic diseases, or healthy volunteers, including adults and children.

      Design:

        -  The purpose of this study is to examine, in an exploratory fashion, a variety of
           biologic assays relevant to the investigation of dermatologic diseases.

        -  Approximately 50 subjects are anticipated to consent to the study each year with an
           accrual ceiling of 500 consented subjects planned over 10 years.
