    <textblock>
      In keratoconus (KC) corneal thinning and protrusion can cause myopia and irregular
      astigmatism, affecting vision. The biomechanical properties of the cornea is maintained by an
      intricate collagen network, which is responsible for its shape and function. In KC this
      collagen network is disrupted resulting in the cornea losing its shape and function.
      Keratoconic changes are focal and localised to certain regions of the cornea and the early
      detection of these changes is challenging. Screening methods include corneal topography
      (evaluation of anterior corneal surface curvature), tomography (assessing the morphological
      features of the anterior segment) and aberrometry (measuring the optical aberrations of the
      eye). More recent research suggests that the biomechanical destabilization of the cornea may
      precede topographic and tomographic evidence of KC. Management of KC depends on disease
      severity with severe cases being treated with keratoplasty and less severe cases with
      cornealcollagencrosslinking (CXL). CXL is an emerging technique, which aims to increase the
      biomechanical strength of the keratoconic cornea. Despite strong evidence of changes in the
      biomechanical properties in human corneas following CXL, there is a significant need for
      accurate measures of biomechanical changes in vivo pre and post CXL. Until recently technical
      limitations have restricted the ability to assess the biomechanical properties of the whole
      cornea in vivo. With the introduction of the CorvisST (Oculus) it is now possible to assess
      regional biomechanical behaviour of the cornea. The output from the device provides a variety
      of parameters to indicate the cornea's biomechanical strength. To date, the association
      between the deflection behaviours in various regions of the cornea in keratoconic eyes preand
      post CXL has not been studied. In order to effectively assess the clinical benefits of CXL
      such information is vital. The primary goal of this investigation is to investigate regional
      biomechanical properties of the keratoconic eye before and after CXL.
