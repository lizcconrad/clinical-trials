      A Phase I study of BPX-501 T cell infusion in adults with recurrent or minimal residual
      disease (MRD) hematologic malignancies post-allogeneic transplant. The treatment consists of
      increasing doses of BPX-501 T cell infusions to achieve a clinical response. AP1903 will be
      investigated for the treatment of aGvHD after BPX-501 T cell infusion to determine a dose
      that can mitigate GvHD and preserve the graft-versus tumor effect.

    <textblock>
      Un-manipulated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is used after stem cell transplantation to
      treat and prevent relapse, to prevent infections and to establish full donor chimerism. The
      addition of mature T cells which exhibit a broad repertoire of T cell immunity against viral
      antigens, as well as against cancer antigens, might provide a clinical benefit. However, an
      expected side effect of the presence of mature T cells is the potential occurrence of acute
      graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The use of a suicide gene switch which would trigger the
      initiation of the apoptosis of the alloreactive T cells by the infusion of a drug would
      represent the potential optimal strategy for restoring early immunity with a built in &quot;safety
      switch&quot; against GvHD side effects. Evidence has emerged that low-dose DLI followed by dose
      escalation can achieve higher clinical response rate with lower GvHD occurrence. Optimization
      of DLI dose and schedule as well as strategies of donor T-cell manipulation may lead to the
      consistent ability to separate GvHD from GvT (graft-versus-tumor) activity and improve the
      safety of DLI treatment. Our strategy is to infuse escalating doses of manipulated T cells
      (from the same donor who provided the original hematopoietic stem cell graft) in adults with
      recurrent or minimal residual disease (MRD) hematologic malignancies post-allogeneic
      transplant to accelerate immune reconstitution thus improving graft versus leukemic effect
      while reducing the severity of GvHD.
