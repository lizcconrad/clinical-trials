      The LUCY Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center
      post-market registry to evaluate the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft Platform when used in the
      endovascular treatment of female patients.

      The primary endpoint is the Major Adverse Event (MAE) rate within 30 days of the initial
      procedure. MAEs will be adjudicated and reported based upon an independent Clinical Events
      Committee (CEC).

      Secondary endpoints of the study will be achieved by demonstrating the benefits in female
      patients (Treatment Group) are comparable to male patients (Control Group) despite the fact
      that historically fewer female patients have been eligible for EVAR, and they have
      experienced a higher rate of access-related complications and higher mortality rates.
      Secondary endpoints will be evaluated through 1 year (365 ± 60 days) post-procedure.

      A maximum of 45 sites across the United States are expected to enroll 225 subjects (75
      females in the Treatment Group and 150 males in the Control Group).

        and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Patients who are male or non-pregnant female (females of child bearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment into the study).

          3. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form.

          4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate for elective open
             surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of
             Anesthesiology (ASA) classification; refer to Appendix II: ASA Classification System).
             ASA category IV patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is greater
             than 1 year.

               1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;5.0 cm in diameter;

               2. Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months; or

               3. Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an

                  repair should preserve patency in at least one hypogastric artery.

               4. Distal iliac artery landing zone an inner wall diameter of no less than 8 mm and
                  no greater than 25 mm.

               5. Distance from the most distal renal artery to most superior internal iliac artery
                  measurement is at least 130 mm.

               6. Aortic angle of ≤ 60 degrees if proximal neck length is ≥10 mm and ≤ 45 degrees

          4. Patient has an acute vascular injury.

          5. Patient has had a previous repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm or an iliac artery
             in intended treatment zone.

          6. Patient has a known thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection that will require treatment
             (surgery or endovascular intervention) within the study period.

          7. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or has an active systemic infection.

          8. Patient has unstable angina (defined as angina with a progressive increase in
             symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina).

             arteries.

         11. Patient requires planned adjunctive devices (e.g. renal stents) to complete the
             procedure.
