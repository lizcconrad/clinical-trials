  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to investigate the feasibility of a
      yoga intervention for adolescents receiving treatment for lymphoma or leukemia. Adolescents
      who participate in the program may experience improved physical and psychosocial measures.
      Improvements in these areas may increase participation in meaningful activity and improve
      quality of life.

      Adolescents diagnosed with cancer may experience more fatigue, anxiety and pain during
      treatment. Yoga is considered a complementary alternative medicine (CAM) that has been
      implemented into some pediatric oncology rehabilitation programs and has been shown to be
      beneficial in both inpatient and outpatient settings. It may decrease anxiety and increase
      quality of life and hamstring flexibility in teens.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To determine the feasibility of yoga intervention for adolescents during lymphoma and
           leukemia treatment.

      OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE:

        -  To obtain pilot data regarding efficacy of yoga on pain, quality of life, fatigue and
           physical performance.

    <textblock>
      Those who consent to participate will participate in 60-minute yoga sessions 2-3 times per
      week for 4-6 weeks. Only specified yoga poses will be implemented during the classes.

      The study will be done in three parts: initial evaluation, yoga therapy, and follow-up
      evaluations.

      INITIAL EVALUATION: Participants will complete the PedsQL Cancer Module questionnaire and the
      PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale questionnaire. Physical performance including
      quadriceps strength, grip strength, hamstring flexibility, and balance, will be assessed.

      YOGA THERAPY: The principal investigator (PI) is a certified yoga therapist (CYT) and is a
      registered yoga teacher with 500 hours of training (RYT 500). Participants will take part in
      a 60-minute yoga session conducted by the PI 2-3 times a week for 4-6 weeks, during which
      time they must complete 8-12 yoga sessions. The yoga intervention includes these parts:
      warm-up, strengthening, increasing hamstring flexibility, balance and relaxation. Yoga poses
      will be used for each yoga session from a predetermined roster depending on individual
      adolescent abilities. This will allow for a tailored but standardized yoga intervention.
      Modifications including chairs, straps and blocks will be allowed to promote appropriate form
      and use of these props will be recorded. Immediately before and after each yoga session, the
      therapist will record pain with the verbal numeric pain scale.

      FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS: After completion of the 4-6 weeks of yoga therapy, participants will
      complete all assessments and physical performance measures that were done in the initial
      evaluation.

    <description>The rate of participants who are willing to participate on this protocol to the total number of participants approached. It is anticipated that 50% approached patients will agree to participate on the study. Twenty five patients will be approached and asked to participate in the study. If more than 6 patients out of 25 approached patients refuse to participate in the study, the study will be closed, and it will be concluded that the trial is not feasible.</description>

    <description>The rate of enrolled and consented patients who complete the 60-minute yoga sessions offered over a 4-6 week period to the total number of participants on the study. It is hypothesized that 60% of those participants will complete the intervention. Thus, if more than 5 patients can not complete the intervention, then it will be concluded that the trial is not feasible.</description>

    <description>A calibrated &quot;Jamar&quot; hydraulic hand dynamometer will be used to measure grip strength. The participant will be seated in a chair with elbow flexion to 90 degrees against torso and the forearm in neutral. The participant will grasp the device and the handle will be adjusted so that digits are able to comfortably grasp the device. The maximum score after 2 trials will be recorded as grip strength for both right and left hand. This assessment will take no more than 5 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>Hamstring flexibility will be assessed by the Sit and Reach Test. The sit and reach is a test to measure hip, hamstring and lower back flexibility. To measure flexibility participants will perform the YMCA sit and reach test. Participants will sit down without shoes or socks with the soles of their feet against the vertical platform of the sit-and-reach box located at the 26 cm (a little over 10 inches) mark. Participants keep their legs straight and their hands overlapped, while reaching for a less than maximum distance twice as a warm-up. This test will take no more than 5 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency is a 9 item standardized assessment that includes standing with feet on a line with eyes open and closed, standing on a line with one foot with eyes open and closed, standing on a balance beam on one leg with eyes open and closed and standing heel to toe on a balance beam. These tests will be administered no more than two times with a maximum score of 10 seconds. Two additional subtests include walking forward on a line and walking heel to toe on a line for a maximum of 6 steps for both tasks. Total time to complete this test is approximately 10-20 minutes.</description>
