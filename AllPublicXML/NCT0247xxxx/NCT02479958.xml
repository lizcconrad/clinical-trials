    <textblock>
      Despite of the decline of dental caries, this disease is still common in polarized groups
      affecting children. Therefore, the aim of this randomized blind in vivo study was to compare
      the antimicrobial effect of two antimicrobial therapies in deciduous carious dentin. Thirty
      two patients aging from 5 to 7 years old had partial caries removal in deep carious dentin
      lesion in deciduous molar and were divided in three groups: 1. Control - chlorhexidine and
      resin modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC); 2. LEDTB - antimicrobial photodynamic therapy
      (APDT) with LED (light emission diode) associated with toluidine blue orto dye solution and
      RMGIC; 3. LMB - APDT with laser associated with methylene blue dye solution and RMGIC. The
      patients were submitted to initial clinical and radiographic examination and demographic
      features were evaluated by biofilm, gingival, and dmft/dmfs indexes, besides clinical and
      radiographic follow up at 6 and 12 months after the treatments. The carious dentin was
      collected before and after each treatment and the number of Streptococcus mutans,
      Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Atopobium rimae and
      total bacteria were established by quantitative PCR.

    <description>Partial carious tissue was removed with conventional dentinal curette and collection of dentin with a micropunch (Ø = 1mm) was performed. The remaining dentin was washed with chlorhexidine 2%.

    <description>Partial carious tissue was removed with conventional dentine curette and collection of dentin with a micropunch (Ø = 1mm) was performed. The remaining dentin was washed with 200 µL of O-Toluidine blue dye (0.1 mg/mL) for 60 s. After this, a red LED light source with wavelength of 630 nm was used at 100 mW power, 9.0 J of energy, for 60 s with energy density of 30.0 J/cm2 . A new dentin collection was performed after this treatment at another site of the cavity and restoration with resin-modified glass ionomer cement Vitremer was placed.</description>

Treatment of the remaining dentin was performed with 200 µL of methylene blue dye 0.01% for 5 min and after this, a red low level LASER light source with wavelength of 660 nm was used at 100 mW power, 9.0 J of energy, for 90 s with energy density of 320.0 J/cm2 .
