  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to identify drivers of cancer by performing comprehensive
      genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic characterization of patient samples as a basis for
      understanding the underlying cause of disease.

      This study involves looking at the DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites in blood and tissue
      samples collected from subjects and linking them to their health information. By doing so,
      researchers hope to discover the underlying molecular causes of human diseases with the hope
      that this information can be used for the development of diagnostic tests and more effective
      treatments.

      Participants will have up to 3 blood tubes (about 30 ml) drawn under the condition that
      protocol criteria for blood sampling is met. Blood samples may be collected each time a
      participant undergoes a provider-ordered blood draw. Urine samples may also be collected
      approximately every 4-6 weeks.

      Participants may be asked to provide approximately 60-120 ml of first-morning-void urine.
      Tissue from a standard care surgical procedure or biopsy may be obtained. Additional core
      biopsies (for research) or excess surgical waste will be collected during each biopsy
      procedure when appropriate and will be processed and stored.
