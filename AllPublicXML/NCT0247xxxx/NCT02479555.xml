      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized pilot study to document the effects of
      adventitial delivery of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection (4 mg/mL) after balloon
      angioplasty of lesions below the knee in symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia
      (CLI). Up to 120 patients (60 treatment and 60 control), including up to 20 Rutherford 6
      patients (10 treatment and 10 control) at up to 30 sites in Europe and the United States.
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device
      adventitial deposition of dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and restenosis in patients
      with clinical evidence of chronic critical limb ischemia with an angiographically significant
      lesion in the infrapopliteal crural vessels.
