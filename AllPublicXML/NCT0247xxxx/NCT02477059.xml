  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand osteoarthritis (HOA) which affects the interphalangeal joints and the
      metacarpophalangeal of the thumb is a common disease, the prevalence of which being about 30
      % of the population over than 70. Some forms of HOA are refractory to usual treatments
      (analgesics, NSAIDs, local injections) and can lead to a high disability. In vitro and in
      vivo studies showed that IL-6 is involved in the OA process. The aim of the present study is
      to assess the efficacy of an Interleukin-6-Receptor Inhibitor (tocilizumab) on pain and
      function in patients with refractory hand OA.

      Patient is randomized to receive investigational product or placebo at week 0 and week 4
      (1:1)

        -  arm 1: 2 infusions four weeks apart of tocilizumab 8mg/kg

        -  arm 2: 2 infusions four weeks apart of saline solution

      Follow-up visits are organized at week 6, and then week 8 and week 12.

      Primary outcome is the pain as assessed with the VAS at week 6. Secondary outcomes include
      morning stiffness duration, patient and practitioner global assessments, functional indexes
      for hand OA, number of painful joints, number of swollen joints.

      110 patients is expected to be randomized in 36 months. Each patient sign an informed consent
      before the beginning of the study.
