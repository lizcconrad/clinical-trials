      The primary objective of the study is to assess the early efficacy of treatment with BG00012
      (dimethyl fumarate) 240 mg twice daily (BID) in the brain of newly diagnosed and
      naive-to-treatment patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The Secondary
      objectives are to establish the time course of the beneficial effect of BG00012 240 mg BID
      over 24 weeks and to evaluate the safety of BG00012.
