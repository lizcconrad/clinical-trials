  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monthly intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) during the first 6 month had great effect for macular
      edema with branch retinal vein occlusion (BVO) both in visual and anatomical outcome. It is
      expected that similar results could be obtained by less frequent IVR. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate if IVR by PRN is as effective as by monthly. In addition, the
      investigators are going to study the relationship between macular edema and the size and
      location of retinal non-perfusion area.

      It was demonstrated in BRAVO study that IVR had great effect for macular edema with BVO both
      in visual and anatomical outcome. However IVR was done monthly for all patients (except Sham
      group) during the first 6 months in BRAVO study. It is expected that similar results could be
      obtained by less frequent IVR, and if so, it will contribute to reduce patient's burden and
      medical cost. Thus it is necessary to determine the optimal regimen of IVR therapy.

      In this study, considering the medical and social circumstances in Japan, the investigators
      are going to investigate if IVR by PRN is as effective as BRAVO study.In addition, the
      investigators are going to study the relationship between macular edema and the size and
      location of retinal non-perfusion area (NPA), because VEGF is thought to be released from
      non-perfused retinal tissue, and VEGF production may be correlated with NPA size and
      location. The investigators are going to measure the size of NPA semi-quantatively by ultra
      wide field fluorescein angiography (UWFA) using Optos 200Tx. Then the relationship with
      macular edema will be studied. The effect of ranibizumab to NPA is controversial. In this
      study, it will be investigated, too.
