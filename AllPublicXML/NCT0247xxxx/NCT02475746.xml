      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of itraconazole after multiple dose
      administration on the single dose PK of PF-06372865.

      Study includes two treatment periods: period 1 is single dose of PF-06372865 given alone
      followed by at least 5-day washout out. The period 2 is 200 mg QD itraconazole given for 8
      days with PF-06372865 single dose co-administered on day 4 (1 hour later than itraconazole
      dose). The PK and safety will be assessed and compared for single dose of PF-06372865 in
      period 1 and period 2.
