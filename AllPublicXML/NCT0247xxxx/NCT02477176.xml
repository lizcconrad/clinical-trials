  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-month, prospective, multicenter study is to investigate the effect of
      annular defect size and other risk factors on reherniation and associated costs in primary
      lumbar discectomy patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll up to 100 patients at select US (approximately 4-7) sites. Patients
      that are scheduled for an L1-S1 discectomy and who meet the pre-operative eligibility
      criteria will be considered for study participation. Patients will be divided into two arms
      (small- and large-defect) based on the size of their annular defect as measured
      intra-operatively; each arm will be capped at 50 patients. All patients included in the trial
      will be followed for at least 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21 to 75 years old and skeletally mature (male or female).

          2. Patients with posterior or posterolateral disc herniations at one level between L1 and
             S1 with radiographic confirmation of neural compression using MRI. [Note:
             Intraoperatively, only patients with an annular defect (post discectomy) between 4mm
             and 6mm tall and 6mm and 10mm wide shall qualify.]

          3. Radiculopathy (with or without back pain) with a positive Straight Leg Raise (0 - 60
             degrees)22 (L45, L5S1) or Femoral Stretch Test (L12, L23, L34)

          4. Oswestry Questionnaire score of at least 40/100 at baseline.

          5. VAS leg pain (one or both legs) of at least 40/100 at baseline.

          6. Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with the clinical
             protocol and willing to adhere to follow-up schedule and requirements.

          7. Minimum posterior disc height of 5mm at the index level.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Spondylolisthesis Grade II or higher (25% slip or greater).

          2. Subject requires spinal surgery other than a discectomy (with or without laminotomy)
             to treat leg/back pain (scar tissue and osteophyte removal is allowed).

          3. Subject has back or non-radicular leg pain of unknown etiology.

          4. Prior surgery at the index lumbar vertebral level.

          5. Subject requiring a spine dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (i.e., patients with SCORE
             of ≥ 6) with a T Score less than -2.0 at the index level. For patients with a
             herniation at L5/S1, the average T score of L1-L4 shall be used.

          6. Subject has clinically compromised vertebral bodies in the lumbosacral region due to
             any traumatic, neoplastic, metabolic, or infectious pathology.

          7. Subject has sustained pathologic fractures of the vertebra or multiple fractures of
             the vertebra or hip.

          8. Subject has scoliosis of greater than ten (10) degrees (both angular and rotational).

          9. Any metabolic bone disease.

             dorsalis pedis or posterior tibialis pulses. If diminished or absent by palpation,
             then an arterial ultrasound is required with vascular plethysmography. If the absolute
             arterial pressure is below 50mm of Hg at the calf or ankle level, then the patient is
             to be excluded.)
