  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that the use of low volume iso-osmolar non-ionic radio
      contrast medium (30 cc) in a thoracic CT Scanning procedure in a selected group of patients
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will avoid contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in comparison
      to a similar group of patients with CKD who receive no contrast medium..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of radio contrast medium enhances the image quality of CT scans. However, contrast CT
      is avoided in patients with CKD for fear of contrast-induced nephropathy. The current
      standard of care for these patients is CT without contrast. Taking advantage of fast scanning
      capabilities of modern CT scanners (64-Multi-Detector CT), the current investigators have
      developed a method to use low volume iso-osmolar non-ionic radio contrast medium (30 cc)
      which can be used in a selected group of adult patients with mild to moderate stable CKD
      (eGFR 16-60 ml/min/m^2 for at least 12 months), who require thoracic CT imaging for
      diagnostic purposes. Up to 100 patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomized to standard care (no-contrast, 50 controls) or low volume contrast CT (50
      intervention group). The peak increase of serum creatinine levels within 72 hours after the
      CT procedure will be measured as an outcome variable for comparison between the two groups,
      as well as a safety monitoring variable in the intervention group (25% increase is the upper
      threshold).

    <description>Subjects in this arm will receive a single intravenous injection of low volume iso-osmolar non-ionic radio contrast medium, prior to undergoing 64-MDCT scanning. The use of low volume radio contrast medium constitutes the intervention. Both experimental and control groups receive a) acetylcysteine inhalation (Mucomyst) 1200 mg po BID x 48 hours starting the day prior to the CT scan; and b) isotonic Sodium Bicarbonate Solution 3ml/kg/hr iv for 1 hour prior to the CT scan and for 6 hours after the CT scan</description>
