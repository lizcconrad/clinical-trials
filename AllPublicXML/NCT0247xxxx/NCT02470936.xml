    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial of a technology-based lifestyle intervention vs. usual care
      among men with low-risk prostate cancer to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the
      intervention and the effect of the intervention on behavior change related to exercise, diet,
      and not smoking.

    <textblock>
      This is a PI-initiated, randomized, unblinded, clinical trial of a technology-based 3 month
      lifestyle intervention vs. usual care among men with low risk prostate cancer. We will
      recruit and consent 76 men with prostate cancer at UCSF. The subjects will be asked to
      complete questionnaires, 7 days accelerometer measurement, body measurements (weight, waist,
      hip, pulse, blood pressure) and collection of blood specimen at baseline and 3 months.
      Subjects will be randomized into two arms (Intervention Group and Control Group). The
      Intervention Group (N=38) will have access to the lifestyle website and an activity monitor
      (e.g., Fitbit), receive text messages, and be provided with individualized lifestyle
      recommendations. The Control Group (N=38) will have standard of care and be asked to continue
      with their usual lifestyle habits. They will receive access to the lifestyle website and be
      provided with individualized lifestyle recommendations at 3 months.

    <description>Men will receive a web-based, personalized lifestyle program. They will receive personalized prostate cancer-specific lifestyle recommendations on specific habits based on their eligibility survey responses. They will have access to online lifestyle modules on the website (diet, exercise, not smoking, support, research), receive a Fitbit and access to a Fitbit account and community, and receive text messages and refrigerator magnet to reinforce behaviors. The website will be updated frequently with new tips and material and two weekly blogs will be maintained. Final content is reviewed by study investigators and patient advocates. Men will complete an intervention acceptability survey (acceptability of the website and intervention components) at 3 months.</description>
