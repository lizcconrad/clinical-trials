  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to define the safe windows for co-dosing of metal-cation antacids with once daily
      administered raltegravir, this study will evaluate the effect of both calcium carbonate and
      magnesium/aluminum hydroxide antacids on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir, due to dosage
      of 1200 mg raltegravir in HIV-infected participants already taking 400 mg raltegravir twice
      daily as part of their HIV treatment regimen.

    <description>In Period 1 participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir alone; followed by Period 2 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and three tablets of TUMS Ultra Strength (US) 1000 taken orally concomitantly; followed by Period 3 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and 12 hours later with 20 mL Leader Antacid Maximum Strength (MS) taken orally; followed by Period 4 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and 12 hours later with three tablets of TUMS US 1000 taken orally. The wait between Periods was a maximum of 7 days, during which participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir once daily. To determine the plasma concentration of raltegravir, blood samples were collected from pre-dose up to 24 hours post-dose, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) modeling was performed on natural log-transformed values to derive geometric least-squares means.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hrs (AUC 0-24hr) of Raltegravir Following Once Daily Administration of Raltegravir</title>
        <description>In Period 1 participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir alone; followed by Period 2 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and three tablets of TUMS Ultra Strength (US) 1000 taken orally concomitantly; followed by Period 3 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and 12 hours later with 20 mL Leader Antacid Maximum Strength (MS) taken orally; followed by Period 4 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and 12 hours later with three tablets of TUMS US 1000 taken orally. The wait between Periods was a maximum of 7 days, during which participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir once daily. To determine the plasma concentration of raltegravir, blood samples were collected from pre-dose up to 24 hours post-dose, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) modeling was performed on natural log-transformed values to derive geometric least-squares means.</description>

        <title>Plasma Concentration at 24 Hrs Post-dose (C24hr) of Raltegravir Following Once Daily Administration of Raltegravir</title>
        <description>In Period 1 participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir alone; followed by Period 2 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and three tablets of TUMS US 1000 taken orally concomitantly; followed by Period 3 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and 12 hours later with 20 mL Leader Antacid MS taken orally; followed by Period 4 where participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir and 12 hours later with three tablets of TUMS US 1000 taken orally. The wait between Periods was a maximum of 7 days, during which participants were treated with 1200 mg raltegravir once daily. To determine the plasma concentration of raltegravir, blood samples were collected at 24 hours post-dose, and ANOVA modeling was performed on natural log-transformed values to derive geometric least-squares means.</description>
