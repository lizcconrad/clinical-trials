  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the impact of detecting active initial caries lesions in
      primary teeth regarding effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, applicability (acceptability and
      satisfaction) and quality of life. For this, 248 children 3-6 years with complete primary
      dentition will be examined and treated in a mobile dental unit, which will temporarily be
      parked in public schools of Sao Paulo. The caries detection will be conducted using the
      International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and, depending on allocation, an
      adjunct criterion for caries activity assessment. Children will be randomized in two groups
      according to the caries threshold to be detected: Group A (only advanced lesions will be
      detected and treated, independently of their activity status) and Group B (all caries
      lesions, including initial ones, will be detected and all active lesions will be treated).
      After this, the treatment plan for each child will be made according to strategies mentioned
      above. Data concerning the cost-effectiveness of the procedures, acceptability / satisfaction
      of children and quality of life will be collected after diagnosis, after the end of treatment
      and 12 and 24 months from the initial examination. For comparison between groups, multilevel
      regression analyses will be performed. The primary outcome will be sites which need of
      operative treatment during the follow-up periods and the secondary outcomes will be the
      cost-effectiveness of each strategy, the acceptability / satisfaction of the child and the
      impact on quality of life.
