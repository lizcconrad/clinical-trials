  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of rVIIa-FP
      (CSL689) in a total of 10 to 16 male or female adults with inherited coagulation factor VII
      (FVII) deficiency. Subjects will receive a single dose of their routine FVII replacement
      product (ie, either recombinant activated coagulation FVII [rFVIIa, eptacog alfa (activated)]
      or plasma-derived FVII [pdFVII]) as a comparator, and will then be randomly assigned to a
      single low dose or a single high dose of the study product CSL689 (8 subjects per CSL689 dose
      level). Serial blood samples for PK analysis will be taken up to 24 hours after the eptacog
      alfa (activated) or pdFVII injection, and up to 48 hours after the CSL689 injection. Subject
      safety will be routinely monitored throughout the study.
