  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical study
      that will enroll approximately 564 T2DM patients who before screening have inadequately
      controlled blood glucose （7.0%≤HbA1c≤10.5% at randomization）despite at least 8 weeks of
      metformin monotherapy at stable doses（≥1500 mg/day).

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either PEX168 100μg, 200μg or PEX 168 Dummy Injection
      as add-on to metformin hydrochloride. The baseline HbA1c level （HbA1c≤8.5% or HbA1c&gt;8.5）is
      designed as the stratification factor based on which a dynamic randomization will be
      performed.

      This study consists of 4 periods： Period 1：Up to 3 weeks of screening period. Period 2：A
      4-week PEX168 dummy injection run-in period. Period 3：A 52-week treatment period (including a
      24-week core treatment period and a 28-week extended treatment period).

      Period 4: A 30-day safety follow-up period.
