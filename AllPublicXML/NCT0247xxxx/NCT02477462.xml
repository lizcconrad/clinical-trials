  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a progressive autoimmune disease of biliary epithelial
      cells resulting in biliary cirrhosis. PBC is characterized by a 90% female predominance, high
      titers of serum anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA) directed against the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase complex E2 subunit and evidence from both human and murine models suggests that
      T-cells, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD) 8+ T cells, are key to the destruction
      of bile ducts. However, clinical trials of classic immunosuppressive drugs including
      corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, and tacrolimus have been largely unsuccessful in
      altering the disease course. This is a single center, prospective, non-treatment study of the
      role of immune responses in PBC patients.

      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH) are common, often &quot;silent&quot; liver diseases. NASH resembles alcoholic
      liver disease, but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. The major feature in NASH
      is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and fibrosis. NASH can be severe and can lead to
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Ten to 20 percent of American have NAFLD with NASH
      affecting 2 to 5 percent of Americans.

      In this study, the investigators will prospectively collect demographic, clinical, and
      laboratory data and blood samples for research purposes on 45 PBC patients and 50 male and
      female NAFLD patients. PBC and NAFLD diagnosis and clinical status will be evaluated by
      magnetic resonance (MR) elastography, transient elastography (FibroScanÂ®) and blood lab
      analysis including anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA),
      immunoglobulins, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and
      coagulation measures). Additionally serum and blood will be obtained from the patients on the
      first visit and at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 &amp; 24. Serum and blood samples will be used
      to measure serum cytokine abundance and transcriptome analysis. For comparison, 95 age (+/- 5
      years) and sex-matched controls without PBC will be recruited for a clinical laboratory,
      cytokine, gene expression analysis. Control subjects will have blood drawn at a single time
      point.

    <description>Comparison of PBC phenotypes defined by alkaline phosphatase response to treatment and degree of fibrosis determined by transient elastography. In addition, Principle component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) will be used to identify phenotypic subject stratification utilizing both cytokine and gene expression data at baseline. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) will be compared between these classes to determine if there is an association between classes.</description>
