      The primary objective is to examine the impact on progression-free survival of targeted
      therapy for breast cancer suggested by proteomic and genomic profiling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To explore the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer suggested by proteomic and
      genomic profiling using RPMA, targeted resequencing, IHC analysis, WGS, RNA-seq, and Exome
      sequencing on progression-free survival. When a molecular target cannot be identified, the
      patient will be treated with a therapy selected on an empirical basis by the
      investigator/treating physician at the individual site and will be followed for survival
      status. Only available, FDA-approved agents will be used.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival will be defined as the interval between the first dose of therapy and the occurrence of disease progression (fatal or non-fatal). Disease status will be assessed every 7 +/- 1 week until progression or time of treatment discontinuation, whichever is later. If progression is not observed at the end of therapy, patients will be assessed every 3 months until progression or further anti-cancer therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic response will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria in all patients with measurable disease. All sites of disease must be evaluated using the baseline assessment methods. Confirmatory assessment of complete response or partial response must be performed no less than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response.</description>
