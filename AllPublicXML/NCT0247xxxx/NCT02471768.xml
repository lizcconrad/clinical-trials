      Abstract

      Objectives:

      Primary: To study the association between central aortic blood pressure indices and coronary
      artery disease in patients undergoing elective angiography. Secondary: (a) To study whether
      any association exists between central aortic pressure indices and the incidence of major
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the same patients during a 6 month follow up period.
      (b) To study whether any association exists between the central aortic pressures and
      peripheral pressures.

      Methods: The investigators conducted a prospective observational study in consecutive
      patients undergoing coronary angiography. Central and peripheral pressures were invasively
      recorded and coronary artery disease (CAD) classified into obstructive and non-obstructive
      group. CAD severity was graded using the Gensini score and subjects were divided into
      tertiles. Patients were followed up and the role of central aortic pressure indices in the
      prediction of cardiovascular events were analysed.
