  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will test the combination of two new drugs, called ibrutinib and ABT199, taken
      together in the treatment of Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Other studies have indicated the potential
      for these drugs to be used in the treatment of participants with Mantle Cell Lymphoma. In
      this study, the investigators will test the combination of the two drugs together, in order
      to determine what effects (good and bad) it has on mantle cell lymphoma.

      This study has two phases. The first phase is the Primary Evaluation Phase and will closely
      monitor the effects of ibrutinib and ABT199 for a period of 13 months. Participants who
      complete 13 months of treatment and continue benefiting from the study treatments will be
      allowed to continue both drugs until progression or intolerance in the Continuation Phase.
      The purpose of this phase is to provide patients with continuing access to both ibrutinib and
      ABT199. Patients will receive routine care from clinician, who will record any sideeffects
      that may be experienced.

      This is one of the first trials in the world to study the combination of ibrutinib and ABT199
      together. Therefore the effectiveness of the combination of the study drugs will be assessed,
      as will how they affect mantle cell lymphoma and how it develops resistance to the
      treatments. The investigators also do not know whether combining the two drugs together will
      cause unexpected side effects. Therefore, the study will monitor patients closely and perform
      scans, blood tests, bone marrow biopsies and other tests at regular intervals.
