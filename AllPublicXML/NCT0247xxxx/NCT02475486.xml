  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the large therapeutic arsenal available since one decade allowing a strong reduction
      of inflammation process, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients claimed pain, fatigue, sleep
      problems and other quality of life outcomes. Fatigue reduction during TNF blockers therapy is
      lower than the strong reduction in RA disease activity. Furthermore, RA patients have higher
      prevalence of non-inflammatory pain than general population. Fatigue is a real major problem
      due to 50% of patients considered it as severe.

      This dissociation between disease activity and fatigue level suggests that fatigue is
      multifactorial. No consistent explanations for fatigue are currently available.
