      The purpose of this study is to determine if Telmisartan, an FDA approved blood pressure
      medication, may also have beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease prevention in African
      Americans, who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.

    <textblock>
      This study will assess if Telmisartan, an FDA approved blood pressure medication, may also
      have beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention in African Americans, who are
      at high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Blood pressure medications known as
      angiotensin-receptor blockers have been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's in
      Caucasians because they act on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a key regulator of blood
      pressure in the body and the brain. The drugs appear to slow the progression of the disease
      by affecting flow of blood and the amount of plaque in the brain, but these benefits have not
      been tested in African Americans. The investigator will evaluate if Telmisartan is able to
      influence the renin-angiotensin system in the brain and produce favorable effects on brain
      blood flow and enzymes that cause the brain plaques in Alzheimer's disease.The investigator
      will assess the mechanism by which Telmisartan modifies the brain renin angiotensin system,
      cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and inflammatory markers in
      hypertensive African Americans.

    <measure>Change in concentration of cerebrospinal fluid angiotensin metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebrospinal fluid renin-angiotensin system (RAS) will be assessed by measuring levels of angiotensin metabolites simultaneously in a single sample of less than 1ml of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using RAS-fingerprint™ technology.

    <description>The Flanker task measures attention and inhibitory control. The subject are asked to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows) flanking it. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time and a 2-vector scoring method is used. Each of these vectors ranges between 0 and 5, and the computed score ranges from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Set-shifting Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The set-shifting is a measure of mental flexibility and assesses attributes of compound stimuli, and to shift that attention when required. The subject is asked to determine whether the card contains a target stimulus dimension (a color or a number). If the guess is incorrect, the subject will hear an error sound and the card will not flip over and the subject would guess again. In this way, the subject is taught that a specific dimension of the card (either a color or a number) is 'correct'. The total number of errors across five rounds is scored. Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spatial 1-Back Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are shown a series of white squares that each appear for a period of 1s in 15 possible locations, equidistant from the center of the computer screen. Subjects are instructed to press the left key when the current square matches the same position as the immediately preceding square and to press the right key when it is in a new location. A number (selected randomly from 1-9) appears centrally on the screen 500 ms after each response and is present on the screen for 1000 ms. Subjects are instructed to recite the number out loud as soon as it appears on the screen before proceeding to the next square; this prevents eye fixation on the location to be remembered. The task consists of 30 trials, with 10 matched trials and 20 non-matched trials. The total number of correct responses for each task is tabulated. Lower scores indicate decreased working memory.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment test is a one-page 30-point test. Each criteria is allocated a point. The total possible score is 30 points and a score of 26 or above is considered normal. Lower scores indicate cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function; orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. Points are allocated for each response.The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-Working Memory subtests</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-Working Memory subtests measure attention, concentration, mental control and reasoning. The subjects will be given tasks which include digit span, arithmetic and letter-number sequencing. Lower scores are indicative of decreased cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wechsler Memory Scale-III Faces Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be shown a number of faces and are asked to identify target faces by responding either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to each face. The subjects are prompted to keep the target faces in mind and are asked to identify the target faces after a timed delay. Lower scores are indicative of decreased cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will be asked to provide oral recall of material read to them. The recall scores are recorded. Lower scores indicate lower recall memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be presented with a list of 15 unrelated words via audio recording and asked recall as many as he/she can. This process is repeated twice more, and the score is equal to the total number of words recalled across all three trials. Higher scores indicate better immediate recall and better cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial Spin Labeling-Magnetic Resonance Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Echoplanar T1 mapping scans will be used for image registration and a scout image of the head will be obtained in order to choose the appropriate location for spin labeling and flow imaging. Arterial Spin Labeling images will be acquired using a custom 3D stack of interleaved spirals fast spin echo sequences and will be averaged in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Images will be interpolated and smoothed in a panel by using a 0.5-pixel, full-width, half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Regional perfusion will be quantified in each hemisphere and maps of cerebral vasoreactivity will be obtained by co-registration of perfusion and anatomical images.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging and White Matter Hyperintensities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>High-resolution anatomical images will be acquired using a 3D-Fast Spoiled Gradient Recalled Echo (FSPGR) Sequence. White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) will be identified by a 3D T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Fast Spin Echo sequence. The images will be co-registered using a within-subject inter-modal alignment between structural and perfusion images. T1-weighted Spoiled Gradient Recalled (SPGR) images will be used to identify cerebrospinal fluid and white and gray matter. Increased volumes of white matter hyperintensities indicate impaired cognitive function.</description>
