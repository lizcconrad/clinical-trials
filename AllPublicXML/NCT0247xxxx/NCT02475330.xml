      This single arm Phase II trial will investigate the feasibility of dietary flaxseed (FS)
      supplementation in subjects receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy for non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Subjects will ingest FS for a period of approximately 8 to 9 weeks during the
      course of radiation treatment. Study participation and surveillance will last approximately 6
      months. Subject specimen collection will include: blood, urine, and buccal swabs at 5 time
      points.
