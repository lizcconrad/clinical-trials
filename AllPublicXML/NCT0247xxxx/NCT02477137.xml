      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of an interactive ICT-platform for use
      in a smartphone or tablet in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The
      hypothesis is that clinical management will be improved and costs reduced and safe and
      participatory care promoted, when patients report symptoms in an application which provides
      self-care advice and instant access to professionals.
