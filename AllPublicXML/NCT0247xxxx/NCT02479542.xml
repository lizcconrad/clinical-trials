  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide prevalence of open wounds is estimated to be approximately 200 million per
      year. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT), the application of a controlled vacuum to an
      open wound cavity, has been clinically demonstrated in developed nations to speed the healing
      time of open wounds by a factor of two or more, and to aid in complete recovery with less
      scar tissue. Use of NPWT devices has not been feasible in an limited-resource settings due to
      cost, bulk, and requirement for consistent electricity. This study aims to follow up prior
      clinical studies that have established the safety and efficacy of simplified NPWT, by
      assessing changes in wound closure time and wound contraction rate when simplified NPWT is
      used in a limited-resource setting.

      Hypothesis:

      Application of WiCare Wound Pump to a standard gauze dressing will result in faster time to
      definitive wound closure and rate of healing in acute wounds from trauma, infection, or
      surgery as compared to standard gauze dressing without negative pressure.

      Study Design A. Single center prospective trial to be conducted at Mbingo Baptist Hospital
      (MBH) a multispecialty hospital located in North-West Cameroon that provides complex surgical
      care.

      B. Phase II C. Two arm trial with all patients with eligible wounds offered entrance into
      Phase II trial D. Blinding: Non E. Indication and patient population: Acute wounds secondary
      to trauma, infection, or surgical excision in adult patients (&gt;15 year old) F. Sample size:
      100 total; based on Schoenfeld's Method to compare two-sample Log-Rank Test with Power of
      80%, significance level=5% G. Random Permuted Blocks: Patients will be randomized in blocks
      of 4 using the following schema Treatment A) WiCare, Treatment B) Standard Dressing: AABB,
      ABAB, BAAB, BABA, BBAA, and ABBA.
