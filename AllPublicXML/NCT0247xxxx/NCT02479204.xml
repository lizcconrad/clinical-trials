      The study will consist of two parts: a pilot part (Part A) that will be completed prior to
      the start of the main part (Part B). The Subjects who will participate in Part A are excluded
      from Part B.

  <why_stopped>
    Based on results from the pilot phase, the study is terminated. No safety events leading to
    discontinuation were reported
