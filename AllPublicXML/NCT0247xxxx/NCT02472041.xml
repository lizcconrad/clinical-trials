    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the comparison of two of re-expansion pulmonary physiotherapy in
      patients with chest tube. The study group received intermittent positive pressure
      intervention and the control group received incentive spirometry intervention associated with
      manual operation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the re-expansion methods increase lung volume increasing gradient of transpulmonary
      pressure (PL) representing the difference alveolar pressure and pleural pressure. Spontaneous
      deep breath increases the PL by reducing pleural pressure (active breathing exercises,
      breathing supporters and manual operation).

      Muller resuscitator consists of a pneumatic valve feature designed to operate with medical
      oxygen. It is used intermittently or continuously for pulmonary re-expansion, with lower load
      imposed work, and increase the efficiency of gas exchange by improving volumes, lung capacity
      and breathing pattern, and reverse atelectasis.

      However, studies show the paucity of data in the literature regarding the Muller Resuscitator
      in different forms and respiratory rehabilitation protocols. In addition, studies show lack
      of standardization of methods and resources used in respiratory therapy in patients with
      chest tube.

    <measure>Change Respiratory function</measure>
    <time_frame>before the intervention (pre) and after drain removal the tube (pos) for 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Ventilometry was evaluated in two stages: 1) before the intervention, 2) on the day of drain removal or discharge. The spirometer application is according to implement stable and acceptable criteria. TOBIN The measures of lung volumes forão performed with the spirometer (FERRARIS MK8 Wright ®) coupled to a nozzle. The patient was instructed to breathe quietly in the apparatus for a minute to read the minute volume (VM). During this period, it is checked the number of breaths, i.e., respiratory rate (RR) for calculating the tidal volume (VT) given by VC = VM / FR (ml).</description>

    <measure>Saturation Oxygen</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation was assessed in two stages: 1) before the first intervention of the day 2) after daily intervention protocol until hospital discharge or removal of the chest tube. Patients were evaluated with breathing in ambient air (without supplemental oxygen) after 10 minutes of the procedure. The researcher used a pulse oximeter portable.</description>
