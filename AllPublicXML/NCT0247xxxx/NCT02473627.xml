  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, cross-over, fixed-sequence study. All subjects will receive the same
      treatment in two study periods. The study is designed to test whether DS-1971a has any effect
      on the activity of various enzymes involved in the metabolism of medicines, using test
      medications. These will be given without and then with DS-1971a to see if DS-1971a has any
      effect on the blood levels of the test medicines.

          -  Male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive.

             Screening investigations, and be taking no regular medication.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) in the range 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighing between
             50 and 100 kg, inclusive. BMI is calculated as weight [kg]/(height [m])*2.

          -  Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential as follows:

        Must be postmenopausal (the last menstrual period was at least 12 months before Screening,
        and a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] test at Screening confirms postmenopausal status);
        or Must be surgically sterile having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
        bilateral salpingectomy and/or bilateral tubal ligation.

          -  Willing to comply with all study restrictions, including the use of contraception,
             concomitant medication and dietary and lifestyle restrictions.

          -  Possessing sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the study and any
             hazards of participating in it, and the ability to communicate satisfactorily with the
             Investigator and to participate in, and comply with the requirements of, the entire
             study.

          -  Have given written consent to participate after reading the ICF, and after having the
             opportunity to discuss the study with the Investigator or his/her delegate.

          -  Have given written consent to have his/her data entered into The Overvolunteering
             Prevention System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG findings or laboratory
             values that could interfere with the objectives of the study or the safety of the
             subject.

          -  Presence of history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to) liver
             or kidney disease, hypertension, seizures, or any known impairment of endocrine, or
             other specific body-organ dysfunction.

          -  Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any medicine.

          -  Presence or history of malignant disease.

          -  Acute or chronic infectious disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             hepatitis B virus or C virus (HCV) infection.

          -  Surgery (eg, stomach bypass) or medical condition that might affect absorption of
             medicines.

          -  Significant illness within 4 weeks before the dose of study medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription
             medicine within the previous 3 months, or unwilling to abstain from participating in
             other clinical trials during the study and for 3 months after receipt of study
             medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical study with DS-1971a.

          -  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in semisupine position at the Screening examination

             100 beats/min. Subjects with Stage 1 hypertension (systolic 140 to 160 mmHg; diastolic
             90 to 100 mmHg) may be enrolled provided they do not have evidence of end-organ
             damage, diabetes or a 10 year cardiovascular risk &gt; 20%.

          -  Abnormal ECG waveform morphology at Screening that would preclude accurate measurement
             of the uncorrected QT interval (QT) duration.

          -  QT interval for heart rate corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval
             duration &gt; 430 msec for men or &gt; 450 msec for women, obtained as an average from the
             measurements on duplicate Screening ECGs.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m*2 or an absolute
             creatinine value above the upper limit of the normal range. eGFR will be estimated at
             Screening using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

          -  Poor metaboliser genotype status for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (Note: this exclusion
             criterion is to ensure that the study population is sensitive to a metabolic
             interaction).

          -  Use of any prescription medicine, over the counter (OTC) medications, herbal remedies
             (such as St John's Wort), or food known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of
             CYP enzymes (also known as CYP450 enzymes) during the 30 days before the dose of study
             medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine, including dietary
             supplements or herbal remedies, during the 7 days before the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Consumption of certain foods or beverages before the dose and throughout the study
             period.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood plasma, platelets or any other blood components during
             the 3 months before the first dose of study medication, or unwilling to abstain from
             doing so during the study and for 3 months after receipt of study medication.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol in the past, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol
             weekly (for men) or 14 units of alcohol weekly (for women).

          -  Use of tobacco products or nicotine containing products during the 3 months before the
             dose of study medication.

          -  Likely possibility that the subject will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Objection by General Practitioner to subjects entering the study.
