    <description>All subjects will receive both Active (Carbon Dioxide Drug Delivery System) and Placebo. This is a single-blind study so subjects will not know the order. Subjects will receive 3 doses of active and 3 doses of placebo. One dose is a 60 second delivery of CO2 or placebo. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects may receive up to 3 additional doses of CO2.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female, 18 years of age and older.

          -  History of classical trigeminal neuralgia with or without persistent background facial
             pain, not secondary, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders
             (ICHD), third edition, beta version (ICHD-3 beta, Cephalalgia 2013).

          -  Diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) for at least 60 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Experience pain with a score of at least 5 on a 0-10 scale during a typical TN episode
             as reported by subject. Note: Prior to treatment pain score must a 5 or greater on a
             VAS.

          -  History of unilateral typical TN pain predominantly in the V2 branch of the trigeminal
             nerve.

          -  Absence of a significant structural lesion (e.g., a tumor) as the cause of pain as
             shown in at least one neuro-imaging study.

          -  On stable dose of all medications, including those for the treatment of TN
             prevention/prophylaxis, for at least 14 days prior to baseline (including, but not
             limited to, verapamil, lithium, melatonin, any anticonvulsant, any systemic
             corticosteroid or steroid injection, occipital nerve block, other cranial or
             extracranial nerve block, or any neurostimulation treatment). Note: Subjects are
             allowed to use their usual standard of care for the acute/abortive treatment of
             trigeminal neuralgia attacks 60 or more minutes after the initial dose, provided it is
             approved by the investigator.

          -  Capable of completing a diary.

          -  Able to provide written Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are unable to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Have recent of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years prior to study enrollment.

          -  Current major psychiatric disorder: suicidal ideation, bipolar, panic disorder,
             schizophrenic, or psychosis. Subjects who are documented as clinically stable and not
             exhibiting symptoms related to their psychiatric disorder are eligible.

          -  History of asthma (other than mild or intermittent).

          -  Have an existing serious unstable systemic disease (e.g., severe emphysema, other
             respiratory diseases, heart disease, etc.) that precludes participation.

          -  Clinically significant nasal disorder (deviated septum, presence of polyps, evidence
             of significant congestion, rhinitis, or other nasal abnormalities) that prevents
             unrestricted breathing through each nostril.

          -  Currently on anticoagulants or have a diagnosis of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Current diagnosis of fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders (TMD), odontogenic pain
             or other orofacial pain.

          -  Surgery for treatment of TN within 30 days prior to screening. Note: Investigator must
             ensure that patients who have had surgery have recovered and are not experiencing any
             side effects from surgery for treatment of TN

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding and/or plan to become pregnant or to
             breast-feed during study participation or within 30 days after treatment.

          -  Participation in a previous study with nasal CO2.

          -  Participation in another investigational drug study within 30 days prior to
             randomization.
