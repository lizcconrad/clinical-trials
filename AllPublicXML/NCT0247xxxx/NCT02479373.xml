      This research is being done to see if resistance exercise (RE) is safe and has a positive
      effect on children and young adults with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

      JIA is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that can cause severe impairment and disability.
      JIA can cause bone loss and decreased muscle strength. The medications used to treat JIA can
      also have negative effects on growth and development, strength, and ability to function. RE
      is performing movements in a slow and controlled fashion (i.e., no speeding up or using force
      in the lifting and lowering of the weight) to lessen force on the joints and tissues. This
      study will be using Ren-Ex exercise equipment to perform RE.

      Currently the American College of Rheumatology recommends exercise for patients with
      arthritis. This exercise includes range of motion exercise to protect joint mobility as well
      as low resistance and aerobic exercise (AE) to protect muscle mass, bone health, and fitness.
      However, a recent study showed no major differences in functionality or quality of life
      between patients who performed AE and those who did not perform AE. There is a need for more
      data on the impact of RE on children with JIA. Children and young adults aged 10 to 21 with
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis may join.

    <description>Those assigned to RE will complete baseline and post-testing assessments and participate in 12 weeks of individually-supervised resistance exercise, which will take place in the exercise facility on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Campus. Exercises will be performed on Ren-Ex Machines. This equipment is suitable for the proposed study because it provides ultra-low friction movement which creates a personalized resistance profile, which minimizes force on joints and thereby reduces the risk of joint trauma and injury.</description>
