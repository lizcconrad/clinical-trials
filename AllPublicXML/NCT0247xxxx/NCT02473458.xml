  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most important causes of mortality and disability both in developed and
      developing countries. The only food and drug administration (FDA) approved therapy for acute
      stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). But narrow therapeutic window has
      limited the usefulness of thrombolytic therapy. Therefore, finding effective neuroprotective
      drugs for the patients for whom thrombolysis is contraindicated or not feasible seemed to be
      mandatory in the world of cerebrovascular medicine.

      Licorice, extracted from root of a plant scientifically known as Glycyrrhiza glabra, is used
      in food industries. Certain medical properties has been contributed to licorice and
      specifically to its active chemical components such as flavonoids and glycyrrhizic acid (GA).
      GA has been revealed to assert its anti-inflammatory effect by suppression of NF-ÎºB, a key
      component of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response. Neuroprotective
      characteristics of GA has been widely investigated in recent studies.

      In the present study, the investigators verified the efficacy and safety of oral
      administration of two different doses licorice extract in the patients with acute ischemic
      stroke, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
