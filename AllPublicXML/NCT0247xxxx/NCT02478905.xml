  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiology and transmission dynamics of influenza in hospitals are only poorly
      understood, particularly with respect to subjects without symptoms of influenza infection
      (e.g. without fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, weakness, headache, loss of
      appetite, or myalgia). Knowledge about whether asymptomatic subjects are able to transmit
      influenza is of major importance. If they do transmit influenza, vaccination of patients and
      healthcare workers (HCW) before start of the influenza season, the permanent use of masks by
      HCW during influenza season, and quarantine for previously exposed inpatients may be the only
      available measures to reduce the number of influenza transmission events from asymptomatic
      subjects in acute care hospitals. Closure of this knowledge gap would be of major benefit to
      infection prevention and control recommendations, and may in turn reduce morbidity and
      mortality associated with influenza in hospitals through improved patient management.

      The epidemiology and transmission dynamics of influenza in hospitals are only poorly
      understood, particularly with respect to subjects without symptoms of influenza infection
      (e.g. without fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, weakness, headache, loss of
      appetite, or myalgia). Knowledge about whether asymptomatic subjects are able to transmit
      influenza is of major importance. If they do transmit influenza, vaccination of patients and
      healthcare workers (HCW) before start of the influenza season, the permanent use of masks by
      HCW during influenza season, and quarantine for previously exposed inpatients may be the only
      available measures to reduce the number of influenza transmission events from asymptomatic
      subjects in acute care hospitals.

      The investigators' key aim is therefore to define whether exposure to asymptomatic subjects
      with influenza infection constitutes a risk for influenza transmission in an acute care
      hospital setting through active, prospective surveillance.

      The investigators' secondary aims are to describe the prevalence of community-acquired
      symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza upon hospital admission and the incidence of
      asymptomatic and symptomatic nosocomial influenza among inpatients; to assess transmission
      dynamics of symptomatic influenza infection in acute care; and to study the incidence of
      asymptomatic and symptomatic influenza, absenteeism (i.e. being absent from work due to
      influenza), presenteeism (i.e. being present at work despite influenza infection) associated
      with influenza, and compliance with infection control recommendations to prevent spread of
      influenza in acute care HCW.

      The investigators plan to enroll 1,260 inpatients and 180 HCW from medical wards at the
      University Hospital Zurich in a prospective study over two consecutive influenza seasons in
      order to detect at least one transmission event from an asymptomatic individual shedding
      influenza virus. Flocked mid-turbinate nasal swabs will be collected daily from consenting
      inpatients starting from day of admission until two days after discharge and from HCW over
      the influenza (winter) season and analyzed for influenza A and B using polymerase chain
      reaction. Simultaneously, signs and symptoms of influenza infection (including cough, sore
      throat, fever &gt;37.8°C, nasal congestion, weakness, headache, loss of appetite or myalgia) as
      well as contact patterns between inpatients and HCW will be recorded. Reconstruction of
      influenza transmission chains will be based on phylogenetic analyses derived from
      next-generation sequence data and epidemiological contact tracing.

    <description>Secondary attack rate of symptomatic influenza among inpatients, among acute care workers and between inpatients and acute care HCW in an acute care hospital setting: as diagnosed by positive influenza PCR from flocked mid-turbinate nasal swab collected in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals following face-to-face contact with an individual with symptomatic influenza infection on the day of contact. Transmissions will be considered 'proven' if confirmed by phylogenetic analyses. Specifically, we expect that whole-genome sequence analysis will demonstrate identical or almost identical influenza strains within transmission chains.
Transmissions will be considered 'probable' if there is epidemiological evidence of face-to-face contact and identical strains have been identified in PCR but whole-genome sequencing was technically unsuccessful;</description>

        This project is a prospective study following patients in medical wards and acute care HCW
        (including nursing staff (nurses and assistant nurses), physiotherapists, house staff with
        direct patient contact and medical doctors (clinical fellows) working on the same wards at
        the University Hospital Zurich. Inpatients and HCW will be recruited from general medical
        and infectious diseases wards, pulmonology wards, hematology wards and from the stem cell
        transplant unit. All HCW and inpatients on the ward under surveillance are eligible for the
        study
