    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about nicotine exposure and the safety of
      electronic cigarettes (EC). It will focus on the areas that are thought to most closely
      relate to the addictive potential of EC, namely: (1) EC as nicotine delivery devices,
      covering issues of nicotine intake and pharmacokinetics, temporal patterns of use and
      titration of nicotine; and (2) subjective effects of EC use, including relationship of use to
      reward, withdrawal and craving.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electronic cigarettes (EC) are nicotine delivery devices that generate a nicotine-containing
      aerosol which is inhaled by the user. EC are perceived by users to be useful in helping
      quitting smoking of conventional tobacco cigarettes (TC) as well as having a presumed lower
      risk of adverse health effects compared to TC, the potential for use in public places,
      reduced cost, and lack of the noxious clinging odors associated with TC use. Many believe
      that electronic cigarette (EC) function as nicotine delivery devices in the same way as
      tobacco cigarettes (TC), and that EC will prove to be just as addictive as TC, but this may
      not be the case because of fundamental differences in the design and method of use of these
      products. Investigators hypothesize that systemic nicotine exposure will be lower with EC
      compared to TC; that despite lower nicotine intake EC users will experience similar reward
      and no greater withdrawal symptoms or craving compared to TC; and that dual EC/ TC users will
      not titrate their daily intake of nicotine in the same way that TC smokers of high- vs
      low-yield nicotine TC do.

      Investigators specifically focus on the areas that are thought to most closely relate to the
      addictive potential of EC, namely: (1) EC as nicotine delivery devices, covering issues of
      nicotine intake and pharmacokinetics, temporal patterns of use and titration of nicotine; and
      (2) subjective effects of EC use, including relationship of use to reward, withdrawal and
      craving. The investigators will also examine aspects of safety of EC use (by assessment of
      cardiovascular and hormonal effects of use and of biomarkers of exposure to potentially toxic
      constituents) and explore the identification and validation of biomarkers that may be useful
      in distinguishing EC from TC use. Study subjects will be dual users of TC and EC so that the
      investigators may compare both modalities of use in experienced users in a within-subject
      design.

      The study will consist of two 1-week blocks (EC-only or TC-only conditions) with 4 days of
      outpatient ad libitum product use followed by 3 days in a clinical research ward to include a
      single-use pharmacokinetic study, monitoring of product use, subjective assessments, blood
      and urine collections to assess biomarkers, and a 24-hour period of cardiovascular
      monitoring. Two additional days at the end of the 2nd block will assess similar measurements
      during a period of nicotine-product abstention.
