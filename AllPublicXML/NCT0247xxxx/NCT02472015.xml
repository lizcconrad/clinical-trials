  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine may facilitate adequate treatment of Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) by
      identifying underlying causes and tailoring a treatment plan (pharmacological or
      non-pharmacologic treatments including provision of staff education and support, training in
      problem solving, and targeted therapy directed at the underlying causes for specific
      behaviors).

    <textblock>
      During a 6-months period, patients will be included in both arms, whenever they present a
      disruptive NPS that requires a specialist consultation based on the long-term care facility
      (LTCF) staff judgment. In the intervention group, a telemedicine (TM) consultation between
      the LTCF staff (medical and nurse staff) and the Memory Center from the University Hospital,
      will occur at inclusion (T0). Then, a second TM consultation will occur at 1 month (T1). In
      the control group management of NPS will be done as usual care. In both groups, patients'
      parameters such as non-programmed hospitalizations and/or consultations due to disruptive
      NPS, psychotropic drugs use, and health costs, will be evaluated at inclusion, 1 month and at
      2 months. Acceptability of the TM among the LTCF staff will be assessed during the study in
      the intervention group.

      In this feasability study, patients will be included by the University Hospital of Toulouse
      and the University Hospital of Limoges.

      These two university hospitals are composed of a group of institutions for elderly people
      located near Toulouse and Limoges.
