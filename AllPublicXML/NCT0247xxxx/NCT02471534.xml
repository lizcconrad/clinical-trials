      The purpose of this study is to evaluate predictability of an abdominal compression-induced
      change of blood pressure for fluid responsiveness in children.

      When there are clinical signs of hypovolemia, such as hypotension, decreased urine output and
      central venous pressure less than 5 mmHg, right upper abdomen is gently compressed for 10
      seconds. Changes of blood pressure are continuously recorded during this period. About 3 min
      later, intravenous colloid fluid 10 mL/kg is infused for 20 min.

      To evaluate the change of cardiac output, transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiography
      is performed before and after fluid administration. In addition, hemodynamic parameters
      including pulse pressure variation, systolic pressure variation, pleth variability index and
      central venous pressure are also recorded before and after fluid administration.

      Finally, patients will be divided into fluid responder group and non-responder group. If
      cardiac output measured using echocardiography increases over 15% after fluid administration,
      the patient is fluid responder. Using ROC curve, diagnostic power of abdominal
      compression-induced blood pressure change for fluid responsiveness will be evaluated.
