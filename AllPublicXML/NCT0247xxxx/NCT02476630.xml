  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen concentration for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and during admission to
      an intensive care unit is important outcome measure for clinical care. Currently, the tool
      used to monitor the oxygen concentration is a central venous access positioned in the
      superior vena cava or in the pulmonary artery to monitor the central venous oxygen saturation
      (ScvO2). However, it is invasive and not always possible due to a lack of a central line
      access. In this research study, the investigator would like use a noninvasive means for the
      ScvO2 by using the thenar tissue oxygen concentration (StO2). The primary aim for the study
      is to determine if the thenar StO2 correlates with ScvO2 and can serve as a noninvasive
      surrogate for ScvO2.

      Participants will be undergoing a cardiac catheterization at Shands Children's Hospital or
      will be admitted to the intensive care unit, and as part of the clinical care either a
      central venous access positioned in the superior vena cava or in the pulmonary artery. As a
      part of the routine clinical care blood gases are frequently taken for continuous evaluation
      of therapy to monitor the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). A measurement of thenar
      tissue oxygen concentration will be timed with a central venous blood gas draw to monitor the
      tissue oxygen concentration (StO2).

      The StO2 measurement will be taken by using the InSpectraTM StO2 monitor manufactured by
      Hutchinson Technology Inc. after applying the noninvasive clip on probe to the thenar
      eminence of the right hand to measure the StO2 level. After a stable reading is obtained for
      60 seconds it will be recorded.

      The two different measurements of oxygen concentration will be compared to determine if a
      correlation exists.
