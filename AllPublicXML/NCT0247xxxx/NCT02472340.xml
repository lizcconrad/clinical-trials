  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in
      the development of age-related muscle decline that may lead to frailty.

      During aging, there is a progressive reduction in the cell's capacity to eliminate its
      dysfunctional elements by autophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of oxidative damage and
      mutations in mitochondria and by the decrease in autophagic flux. In fact, it has been
      demonstrated that dysfunctional mitochondria can be specifically targeted for elimination by
      autophagy, a process that has been termed mitophagy.

      A major challenge in the clinic today is in the lack of validated tools, including
      biomarkers, to assess the decline in mitochondrial health associated with an impairment in
      muscle function. In the present study, the investigators will employ a battery of established
      and exploratory tests (clinical, physiological and molecular) to assess in vivo mitochondrial
      function and more specifically, the levels of mitophagy and autophagy, in the muscle of
      healthy and pre-frail elderly.

      It is anticipated that the results of this study will facilitate the rapid translation of
      interventions targeting mitophagy and autophagy for the improvement of muscle function.
