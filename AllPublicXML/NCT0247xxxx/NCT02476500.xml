  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective case-control study, 140 medical students (,novices') and 10 Senior
      gynecologists (,experts') will perform a Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone
      (LLETZ) on a Training model afte having undergone a Video Training session. Their
      LLETZ-Performance will be assessed using an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical
      Skills (OSATS) protocol designed for judging the surgical proficiency when performing a
      LLETZ. Using metrical and non-metrical data points, construct validity of the LLETZ training
      model to distinguish between experts and novices will be assessed. Secondary endpoints are
      differences in OSATS scores within the group of novices based on gender and handyness, as
      well as satisfaction of the novices with the learning experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective case-control study, 140 medical students (,novices') and 10 Senior
      gynecologists (,experts') will be included. All participants undergo a video training with
      demonstration of the LLETZ procedure on a training model using a sausage as previously
      described (Hefler et al. 2014). After the Video Training, the LLETZ procedure will be
      performed by the study probands and their performance will be assessed using an Objective
      Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) protocol with 23 consecutive items. The
      exact time Frame for the assessment of the Primary outcome is within 1 hour after the Video
      Training. Using metrical and non-metrical items, the construct validity of the LLETZ training
      model to distinguish between experts and novices will be assessed. The study hypothesis is
      that the LLETZ Training model as used in this study has construct validity and is therefore a
      valid Instrument to discriminate between experts and novices. Secondary endpoints are
      differences in OSATS scores within the group of novices based on gender and handyness, as
      well as satisfaction of the novices with the learning experience.
