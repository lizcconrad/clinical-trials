  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) will require long saphenous
      vein (LSV) harvesting from the leg. This has been reported to be associated with a
      significant morbidity (leg swelling, pain, infection, bruising, wound discharge) in up to 50%
      of patients. Endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) which has been reported to be associated with a
      reduction in these complications was implemented within the investigators' service in 2012.
      Although some initial reports of concerns regarding graft patency when the LSV is harvested
      by EVH, NICE and European Cardiology Society (ESC/EACTS) guidelines 2014 supported the use of
      the EVH technology. Last year a service evaluation in the investigators' department showed
      significant cost benefit of EVH as compared to open vein harvest (OVH) in a matched group (50
      EVH and 50 OVH patients). The purpose of this study is to evaluate this group further to
      assess the incidence of MACCE (Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event) and patient's
      quality of life (QOL) at least 1 year after their surgery. MACCE will be assessed by
      contacting the patient's GP and/or Cardiologist and QOL questionnaire (SF12v2) will be sent
      to patients along with a patient information sheet. It is estimated that data collection
      would be completed within 3 months of start.

        Fifty patients who underwent EVH (Study group) were part of our service evaluation when EVH
        was introduced to our practice. These patients were matched with patients undergoing CABG
        during the same period but where the LSV was harvested by OVH (50 patients, control group).

        This service evaluation showed a significant cost benefit when EVH was used in terms of
        reduction in the inhopsital stay, leg wound pain, leg wound infection and need to attend
        wound clinic. The current study is an extension of the service evaluation to assess how
        these patients are doing at least a year after their surgery in terms of MACCE, QOL,return
        to normal activities and survival
