    <textblock>
      The study was designed according to the draft of allergenic product regulation published by
      Spanish Regulatory Agency. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      subcutaneous immunotherapy with Parietaria judaica pollen extract in patients with
      rhinoconjunctivitis with or without associated mild asthma. In addition, surrogate efficacy
      parameters will be evaluated: immunoglobulin level changes and skin reactivity.

      Parietaria judaica is a weed widespread throughout the Mediterranean área. Prevalence of
      sensitization to Parietaria judaica's pollen is very high in the Mediterranean areas,
      reaching 41.4% among allergic patients on the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

      The study has been designed as an open trial which will be conducted in 4 Spanish sites.

          2. Patients must be between 18 and 60 years of age.

          3. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis against Parietaria judaica during
             a minimum of 2 years prior to study participation. Although allergic
             rhinoconjunctivitis is the pathology under study, the inclusion of patients with mild
             concomitant asthma is allowed (GINA 2013).

          4. Patients who obtained a prick test result ≥ 3 mm diameter to Parietaria judacia.
             Positive and negative control of the test should give consistent results.

          5. Patients with specific immunoglobulin E ≥ class 2 (CAP/PHADIA) to Parietaria judaica.

          6. Patients sensitized to Parietaria judaica with clinically relevant symptoms in which
             treatment with Parietaria judaica 100% vaccine is indicated.

          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening
             visit/Visit 0.

          8. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an appropriate contraception method
             during the study if they are sexually active.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who received immunotherapy in the previous 5 years for Parietaria judaica or
             fo rany allergen with cross reactivity or patients that are currently receiving
             immunotherapy for any allergen.

          2. Patients with severe asthma or forzed expiratoy volumen in 1 second FEV1&lt; 70% even if
             the are pharmacologically controlled .

          3. Patients with: immunological, cardiac, renal or hepatic illnesses or any other medical
             condition that the investigator deems relevant so as to interfere with the study.

          5. Patients with chronic urticaria,

          6. Patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis

          7. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial within 3 month prior to
             enrolment.

          8. Patients under treatment with tricyclic antidepressives, phenothiazines , β-blockers,
             or Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)
