      The aim of this pragmatic cluster-randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness of an
      evidence-based, patient-centered multifactorial fall injury prevention strategy in community
      dwelling older adults at risk of falls recruited from 86 primary care practices around the
      U.S.

      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based, patient-centered
      multifactorial fall injury prevention strategy implemented within primary care practices
      using usual health care resources

      Design: This study is a cluster randomized, parallel group superiority trial with practices
      stratified by healthcare system and patients nested within practices. The unit of
      randomization is the practice.

      Study Duration: The total study duration is 4 years. Recruitment will take place over 20
      months, with follow-up taking place for 20 months - 40 months depending on date of
      enrollment.

      Trial Sites : 86 primary care practices that are part of 10 trial sites located around the
      U.S.: The Partners' Health Care System; Essentia; Hopkins Health Care System; HealthCare
      Partners; Reliant Health Care System; Mount Sinai Health Care System; University of
      Pittsburgh Health Care System; University of Texas Medical Branch Health Care System;
      University of Iowa Health Care System; University of Michigan Health Care System.

      Number of Subjects: The original target sample size was 6,000 participants enrolled in 86
      practices to provide 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of the primary outcome
      with intervention relative to control. The study was originally designed for a study duration
      of 36 months with 18 months of recruitment and a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. The study
      was extended to a 40 month study (20 months of recruitment and a minimum 20 month of
      follow-up). For a 40 month trial, it was estimated that a sample size of ~5400 subjects would
      provide 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of the primary outcome with the
      intervention relative to control.

      Main Inclusion Criteria Community-living persons, 70 years or older, who are at increased
      risk for serious fall injuries.

      Intervention: An evidence-based patient-centered intervention that will combine elements of a
      multifactorial, risk factor-based, standardly-tailored fall prevention strategy developed at
      Yale, practice guidelines offered by the Center for Disease Control's (CDC's) &quot;STEADI&quot;
      toolbox (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Disability and Injury) and the joint American Geriatrics
      Society/British Geriatrics Society guidelines, and Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders
      (ACOVE) practice change approach. The fall prevention strategies will be systematically
      implemented into clinical practice using: delivery system design to improve quality
      (Co-management); decision support (algorithms); information systems (software);
      self-management support (patient/caregiver engagement and activation); and linkage to
      community-based resources.

      Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is serious fall-related injuries, operationalized as
      those leading to medical attention, including non-vertebral fractures, joint dislocation,
      head injury, lacerations, and other major sequelae (e.g. rhabdomyolysis, internal injuries).

      Primary Analysis: The risk of any serious fall injury (i.e., time to first event) will be
      analyzed using a survival model that incorporates competing risks (due to death) and
      clustering. In this analysis, participants who are lost to follow-up without a prior serious
      fall-related injury will be censored at their date last seen. In a secondary analysis, the
      investigators will adjust for the pre-specified set of baseline covariates to examine their
      influence on the intervention effect.

      Secondary Outcomes: Number of falls, number of all fall-related injuries, and measures of
      well-being.
