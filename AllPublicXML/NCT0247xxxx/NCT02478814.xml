  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein requirements in active individuals have been suggested to be greater than the current
      recommended dietary allowance (RDA).

      Nutritional requirements for dietary amino acids in adults have traditionally been determined
      utilizing the nitrogen balance technique, which is prone to underestimating protein
      requirements. As a result, there is a need to re-evaluate recommendations in order to
      characterize how dietary amino acid needs may be modulated by physical activity.

      Recent studies using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique
      have suggested that protein requirements in young men are at least 50% higher than the RDA
      based on nitrogen balance data.

      The purpose of this study is to measure the protein requirement in active, young adult males
      using the IAAO technique in the presence of a variable intensity exercise stimulus.
