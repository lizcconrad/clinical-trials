  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High levels of fatty substances in the blood increase the risk of developing coronary heart
      disease and having a heart attack. The investigators know a lot about one of these fatty
      substances, cholesterol. However, there is another fatty substance in the blood called
      triglyceride. The investigators do not understand much about what regulates the rate at which
      the liver produces triglyceride and liberates it into the bloodstream after eating a meal(s).
      The investigators are developing new techniques to measure these processes in healthy people.
      Ultimately a deeper understanding of the regulation of this process might lead to the
      development of new treatments for fat accumulation in the liver and high blood fat levels and
      related disorders. The present study is an investigation of how these processes relate to
      various bodily characteristics such as thinness and fatness and the distribution of fat in
      the body.

      The investigators will recruit men and women with no medical condition or relevant drug
      therapy that affects lipid, glucose or liver metabolism.

      Purpose and design:

      The investigators are asking the research question: &quot;How does the amount and type of sugars
      consumed, such as those found in soft drinks, influence postprandial fatty acid and liver fat
      metabolism?&quot;

      It is known that consuming fructose by itself or with glucose can increase plasma
      triglyceride concentrations and liver fat amounts but it remains unclear how this happens.

      To address this research question investigators want to undertake detail physiological
      studies, in a randomised cross-over study where individuals will be studied twice after the
      consumption of a single test meal that will contain different amounts of glucose and fructose
      with the same amount of dietary fat.
