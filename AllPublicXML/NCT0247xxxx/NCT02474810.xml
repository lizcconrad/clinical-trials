  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters (CVCs) are used for vascular access by approximately 56% of our 380
      hemodialysis (HD) patients at the Capital Health Renal Program. The major complication of
      these catheters includes thrombosis and infection. Catheter locking solutions such as
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), Alteplase (CathfloÂ®) are used to treat and
      prevent clotting of the catheter during HD treatments and during the interdialytic period.
      Evidence to guide the use of rt-PA is limited. This quality assurance project will compare
      the effectiveness and cost of an intensive versus a standard catheter dysfunction protocol
      for rt-PA in HD patients.

      The proposed study will be a retrospective cohort study of consecutive HD patients conducted
      at a HD unit using two catheter dysfunction protocols during January 2013 to Septebmer 2013.
      In the Intensive Protocol, rt-PA intervention is administered to all catheters based on blood
      flow and/or line reversal. In the Standard Protocol, rt-PA intervention is administered to
      all catheters based only on blood flow.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adults undergoing HD with a tunneled CVC (both newly inserted CVCs as well as
             pre-existing CVCs) will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from using the CVC dysfunction protocols if they had a known
             allergy or intolerance to rt-PA.

          -  A physician order to proceed with the CVC dysfunction protocols was required if they
             met one of the following criteria:

          -  CVC line insertion or exchange within 72 hours;

          -  any surgery, organ biopsy, obstetrical delivery within 72 hours;
