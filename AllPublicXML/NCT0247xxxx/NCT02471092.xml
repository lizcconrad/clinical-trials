  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test modified milk protein products to determine
      the effects of amino acids on food intake, satiety, insulin secretion and glucose control by
      insulin-independent action in healthy adults.

      1. A total of 33 males and females will participate in the study. Capillary blood samples
           will be collected from all participants to measure plasma glucose over a 3.5 hour
           postprandial study.

        2. Intravenous blood samples will be collected from a subset of 12 (6 males and 6 females)
           participants for determination of insulin, satiety hormones, acetaminophen (gastric
           emptying rates), and determination of amino acid profiles.
