      This pilot clinical trial studies the safety of a dendritic cell vaccine when given with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread beyond the
      breast and local lymph nodes to other organs in the body. The vaccine is made up of natural
      cells found in the blood, called dendritic cells, and peptides, or small fragments of protein
      which are loaded onto the dendritic cells. This combination may help activate the immune
      system against stromal cells, which are cells that help cancer cells survive in the body.
      Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a chemotherapy drug that is given before the vaccine to help
      shrink the tumor and control cells that may interfere with the activity of the vaccine.
      Interfering with the stromal cells that help support the growth of cancer cells may lead to
      the death of the cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety of gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM) + alpha-type-1 dendritic cell
      (αDC1)-tumor blood vessel antigen (TBVA) vaccination (tumor blood vessel antigen
      peptide-pulsed alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine).

      II. Assess the clinical response of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to GEM + αDC1-TBVA
      vaccination.

      III. Determine the clinical efficacy of GEM + αDC1-TBVA vaccination in generating T-helper 1
      cell (Tc1) immunity.

      IV. Correlate changes in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) with the generation of anti-TBVA T-cell immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Beginning 3, 7, or 10 days later, patients
      receive tumor blood vessel antigen peptide-pulsed alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell
      vaccine intradermally (ID) followed by a second vaccination 7 days later. Courses may repeat
      after at least 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
