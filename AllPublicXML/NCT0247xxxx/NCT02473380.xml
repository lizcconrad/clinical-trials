  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative surgical fluorescence microscopy is a useful technique for the surgical
      resection of glioma. However the accuracy of this method is limited by its too low
      sensitivity. Fluorescence spectroscopy has the potential capacity to overcome the current
      limitations of conventional fluorescence guided surgery by increasing the sensitivity: in a
      pilot study on brain tumor biopsies, fluorescence spectroscopy was shown to measure
      two-peaked 5-ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence emission spectrum which
      clearly enables to distinguish the solid component of glioblastomas from low grade gliomas
      and infiltrative component of glioblastomas. This innovative method could become in future a
      useful tool for real-time diagnosis of brain lesions (initial diagnosis or follow-up post
      resection to check for residual dysplasia) and real-time assessment of resections margins
      during surgery. However, those preliminary ex-vivo results have to be confirmed in a
      feasibility in-vivo study on human.

    <description>A prototype of intraoperative fluorescence spectroscope will be used for fluorescence spectroscopy during a surgical procedure (open surgical approach only). The experimental probe dedicated to the spectroscopic system will be positioned against the surface of the brain, emission spectrum will be acquired and measured, and finally compared with anatomopathology exams. One specific medication will be used as contrast agent in the study: 5 amino-levulinic hydrochloride (GLIOLAN, MEDAC) orally at the dose of 20mg/kg of body weight.</description>
