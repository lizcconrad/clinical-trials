      The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether FP187 is effective in the treatment of
      mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of FP187 compared to placebo over 24 weeks of treatment
      in patients with mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The daily dose levels in the
      FP187 arm will be 500 mg. After completion of the double blind treatment of 24 weeks, all
      patients irrespective of their treatment arm will be switched to an additional 24 week
      open-label treatment phase with 500 mg / day FP187. Patient who do not complete the 24 week
      double blind part of the study as scheduled will not be eligible for participation in the
      open-label part.
