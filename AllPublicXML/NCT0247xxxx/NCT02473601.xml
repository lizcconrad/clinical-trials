      Observed the muscle relaxation of mivacurium in patients with liver cirrhosis.Clear of
      mivacurium in patients with liver cirrhosis without muscle relaxant accumulation and delayed
      recovery phenomenon

      The liver is an important organ of the body to maintain life activities, material and energy
      metabolism, and the main organ of biotransformation and elimination of toxic substances and
      drugs, have many complex functions. Anesthetic drugs mostly through liver transformation and
      degradation.Liver cirrhosis, liver cancer patients due to abnormal liver dysfunction and
      liver metabolism, Most of the muscle relaxant prone to muscle relaxant accumulation and
      delayed recovery of patients with liver cirrhosis.

      Mivacurium is a new type of non depolarizing muscle relaxants，has the characteristics of
      rapid onset, short duration of action. Mivacurium can produce similar clinical effect of
      depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and rapidly be blood Che catabolism, Without
      liver metabolism. It can either as a single vein for medicinal endotracheal intubation, or as
      maintain continuous intravenous auxiliary anesthesia drug , is a muscle relaxant to shorten
      the clinical anesthesia recovery period ideal.

Anesthesia maintenance:
Two groups of sevoflurance 1%~8% inhalation anesthesia plus intravenous infusion of remifentanil 0.05～0.2 µg/kg/min,Mivacurium Chloramine 6mg/kg/h, Appropriate supplementary analgesia dose of sufentanil before skin incision and the abdomen was closed. The two groups were maintained until the Bis value was 40 ~ 60. PetCO2 was 30 ~ 35mmHg. Hemodynamic fluctuations did not exceed 20% of the baseline value.At least 20 minutes before the operation stopping Mivacurium infusion,Before the end of operation 5-10 minutes stopping infusion of remifentanil and sevoflurane.</description>
