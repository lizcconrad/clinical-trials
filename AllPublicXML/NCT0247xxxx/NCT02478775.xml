  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess maternal weight, especially obesity, influences almost every aspect of fertility, from
      conception to problems during pregnancy. The investigators will use novel statistical methods
      to clarify the hormonal changes behind reproductive health conditions. A better understanding
      of reproductive hormonal changes in obese women may offer a way to identify new treatments.

      Hypothesis. Insufficient FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone) pulsatility, as seen in obesity,
      results in inadequate folliculogenesis and reduced ovarian steroid and protein production.

      AIM: To test the hypothesis that insufficient FSH pulsatility, as seen in obesity, results in
      inadequate folliculogenesis and reduced ovarian steroid and protein production. The
      investigators will determine if exogenous FSH administered in a pulsatile fashion results in
      a significant increase of ovarian hormones in obese women. Serial inhibin B and E2 levels
      will be measured in obese and normal weight women undergoing frequent blood sampling studies
      before and after GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonist blockade.
