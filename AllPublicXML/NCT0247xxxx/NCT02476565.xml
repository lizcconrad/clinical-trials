  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of intubating the
      tracheal using an Aintree intubation catheter through either the LMA-S or I-gel supraglottic
      devices
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the proposal, the investigators are comparing two different types of supraglottic
      devices. One is the LMA Supreme (laryngeal mask airway) and the other is the I-gel. The study
      is designed to use the supraglottic airway device as an adjunct to tracheal intubation, not
      as the definitive airway. The investigators will be utilizing the Aintree intubation catheter
      over the fiberoptic bronchoscope in an effort to secure the airway. This technique has been
      well described in the literature and has been proven effective and safe.
