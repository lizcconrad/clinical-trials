  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sphincterotomy is now an established method for removal of common bile duct
      calculi and treatment of papillary stenosis, the sump syndrome and certain cases of ampullary
      carcinoma. It is also generally performed prior to biliary stent placement .Anatomical
      variations, papillary stenosis, impacted stones, ampullary tumors, duodenal diverticula, and
      post-gastrojejunostomy states are some of the reasons behind difficult common bile duct (CBD)
      cannulations . In these situations, the success of CBD cannulation can be enhanced slightly
      by using the various accessories designed for this purpose.The aim of this study is to
      prospectively compare conventional approach and needle knife fistulotomy in cannulation of
      ampulla of Vater during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography regarding
      procedure-related complications as failure of cannulations, bleeding and perforation and
      postoperative complication

      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare conventional approach and needle knife
      fistulotomy in cannulation of ampulla of Vater during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography regarding procedure-related complications as failure of
      cannulations, bleeding and perforation and postoperative complication This a prospective
      randomized controlled trial comparing two groups of patients who undergo endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography for obstructive jaundice in Gastrointestinal Surgical
      center, Mansoura University, Egypt. From January 2014 to December 2014.

      Group A consists of 50 patients who will undergo conventional approach and group B consists
      of 50 patients who undergo needle knife fistulotomy for cannulation of the ampulla of Vater.
      Randomization was done by paramedical personnel in the ERCP unit by taking a number from an
      envelope.

      Data will be registered in a specially prepared sheet for the purpose of the study.
      Registered data will include: duration of cannulation, number of trials for cannulation,
      number of pancreatic cannulation, bleeding during cannulation and its management, need to
      convert to the other approach in cannulation.

      Data also included postoperative hospital stay, serum amylase level and postoperative
      complications as pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding and cholecystitis. Pancreatitis will be
      also graded according to its severity depending on the duration of hospital stay.
