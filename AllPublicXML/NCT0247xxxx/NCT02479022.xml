  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and
      pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of insulin 320 in healthy
      subjects.
