  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of psychosocial factors in creating
      Persistent Post-concussive symptoms (PPCS). The researchers investigate three hypotheses: (a)
      Do pre-injury psycho-environmental deficits predict a higher level of PPCS? (b) Do
      socio-demographic and personal pre-injury deficits relate to (1) a more negative attribution
      for the child injury by their parents and (2) embracing of a more permissive and
      authoritarian parenting; and do these factors mediate the symptoms' preservation? (c) Does
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) benefit to reducing PPCS emotional and behavioral
      symptoms?

      200 children and adolescents with post concussion will be followed for 9 months, since the
      time of the head injury. Post concussive symptoms, along emotional distress and
      neurocognitive deficits will be examined at 2 weeks, 4 months and 9 months since the injury,
      using self report questionnaires, psychological evaluation and neuropsychological tests.
      Participants who demonstrates PPCS 4 months after the injury will be assigned either to the
      Cognitive Behavioral Treatmet group (CBT) or to the Treatment as Ususal group(TAU). The
      change in symptoms severity (PCS, emotional distress and neurocognitive deficits) will be
      compared between the two study groups in order to assess treatment efficacy.
