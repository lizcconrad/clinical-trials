    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to conduct a pilot study to investigate whether pancreatic
      enzyme supplementation will improve symptoms in individuals with celiac disease who suffer
      persistent symptoms despite a gluten free diet. This protocol specifically aims to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme supplementation for reduction of
           gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet.

        2. Assess the ability of fecal elastase levels to predict response to pancreatic enzyme
           supplementation in patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet.

          -  Biopsy proven celiac disease.

          -  Age 18-80.

          -  Ongoing symptoms defined as a CeD-GSRS score of greater than 3 during the run in
             period.

          -  Subject must be following a gluten free diet.

          -  tTG &lt; 40 units at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking prescription or over the counter enzyme supplements for 1 month prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding or planning pregnancy. Woman using acceptable methods of
             contraception will be included. Acceptable methods of contraception include oral
             hormonal contraceptives, implanted hormonal contraceptives, diaphragm with spermicide,

          -  English proficiency unsuitable for completion of surveys.

          -  Known severe pancreatic disease.

          -  Known history of prior cancer (except squamous or basal cell skin cancer).

          -  Patients with lactose intolerance who are unable to tolerate a minimum of 1oz (2
             tablespoons) of whole milk per day.

          -  Clinically significant abnormality in safety lab values (i.e. CBC and BMP) at
             screening that may impact subject safety or the scientific integrity of the study.

          -  Other known active GI condition including but not limited to inflammatory bowel
             disease, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, and obvious FODMAP intolerance.

          -  History of all major gastrointestinal surgery other than appendectomy or
             cholecystectomy.

          -  Comorbid condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             subject's participation in the study or would confound the results of the study.
