    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid (CPI-613) when given together with cytarabine and
      daunorubicin hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating older patients with newly
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. CPI-613 may kill tumor cells by turning off mitochondria
      (small structures in the cancer cells that are found in the cytoplasm [fluid that surrounds
      the cell nucleus]). Mitochondria are used by cancer cells to produce energy and are the
      building blocks needed to make more tumor cells. By shutting off mitochondria, CPI-613 may
      deprive the cancer cells of energy and other supplies that they need to survive and grow.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving CPI-613 together with
      cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Phase I) II. To determine treatment
      response with the addition of CPI-613 to induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of administering CPI-613 under the proposed study regimen. (Phase
      I/II) II. To assess survival endpoints of patients receiving the proposed study regimen.
      (Phase II) III. To assess the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid
      followed by a phase II study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-7,
      daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2
      hours on days 3-7. Patients then undergo biopsy on day 14. Patients experiencing significant
      residual disease receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-5, daunorubicin hydrochloride
      IV on days 1-2, and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-5.

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 42 days later, patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days
      1-16 and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 2-6. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients not undergoing transplant after consolidation receive
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
