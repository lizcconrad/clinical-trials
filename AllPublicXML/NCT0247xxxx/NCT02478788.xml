  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see the affects of the study medication called mixed
      amphetamine salts-extended release (MAS-XR) on brain function by taking brain pictures. The
      researchers also want to see if MAS-XR makes your child more or less likely to develop
      problems like acting out (i.e. periods of irritability, agitation, aggression).

      MAS-XR is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, children and adolescents.

      A 12-week prospective study of two groups of adolescents (ages 10-18 years) with attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); 1) ADHD adolescents with a first degree relative with
      bipolar disorder (&quot;high-risk&quot;) and 2) ADHD adolescents without any first or second
      degree-relatives with a mood disorder (&quot;low-risk&quot;). Patients will be evaluated using
      diagnostic interviews and symptom ratings, will receive neuroimaging scans (fMRI, DTI, 1H
      MRS), and will then be assigned to treatment. Low-risk ADHD adolescents (n=60) will receive
      treatment with open-label mixed amphetamine salts-extended release (MAS-XR), which is
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of ADHD
      and is a commonly prescribed psychostimulant medication for adolescents with ADHD. High-risk
      ADHD adolescents will be randomized to double-blind treatment with MAS-XR (n=60) or placebo
      (n=60). Following initiation of treatment, the ADHD adolescents will have regularly scheduled
      visits during which symptom and tolerability ratings will be performed. Healthy subjects
      (n=60) will be recruited from the community and will not receive medication but will undergo
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at the same intervals to assess normal variability in
      imaging parameters between time points as well as to adjust and interpret comparisons within
      patients (i.e., whether patient values are changing toward or away from those of healthy
      adolescents). Neuroimaging (fMRI, DTI,1H MRS) evaluations will be performed at baseline and
      Week 12 (or termination).

    <measure>Baseline-endpoint change in prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity by fMRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), change in prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity will be determined by contrasting baseline and endpoint blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (BA47) during performance of the CPT-END task, and determining the prefrontal-amygdala interrelationship using a seed-region (amygdala) based functional connectivity analysis.</description>

    <measure>Baseline-endpoint change in uncinate fasciculus white matter integrity by DTI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in uncinate fasciculus white matter integrity will be determined by contrasting baseline and endpoint fractional anisotropy using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).</description>

    <measure>Baseline-endpoint change in glutamate (Glu) and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations in the prefrontal cortex (BA47) by 1H MRS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite measure of change in right and left prefrontal cortex (BA47) Glu and NAA concentrations (mM). It will be determined by contrasting baseline and endpoint levels using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS).</description>
