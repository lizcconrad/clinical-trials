    <textblock>
      Fetal growth abnormalities is one of the most common problems faced in modern obstetrics. The
      association between low birth weight and perinatal death as well as severe morbidity is well
      known. Since fetal weight cannot be measured directly, obstetricians use estimates of fetal
      weight obtained by utilizing various ultrasonographic measurements to diagnose growth
      abnormalities. Currently in clinical practice, the majority of fetal ultrasound centers
      employ population-based fetal growth curves that have been previously published and updated
      to estimate fetal weight percentiles. Up to 70% of neonates found to be below the 10%
      percentile for estimated fetal weight in population-based growth curves are actually
      constitutionally small; that is a neonate deemed &quot;small&quot; based on standardized growth curves
      but in reality have reached its appropriate growth potential in relation to its genetic
      predisposition.

      An equally difficult clinical scenario is fetal macrosomia. A recent meta-analysis revealed
      that the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound detection of fetal macrosomia ranges from
      15-79%. When compared with neonates with normal birth weight, the odds ratio of emergency
      cesarean delivery and shoulder dystocia are increased significantly.

      Various ultrasound parameters have been tested in an effort to detect both fetal compromise
      prior to the development of permanent damage and allow differentiation between true fetal
      growth abnormalities and normal growth potential. Recent reports have introduced the concept
      of customized fetal growth curve which uses physiological variables to report an adjusted
      fetal growth assessment. To date, the use of customized fetal growth curves has not been
      evaluated prospectively. Furthermore, this strategy has not been compared to standard
      population-based fetal growth curves currently used in clinical practice to determine which
      would be the most ideal for use in clinical practice.

      The primary research question is: are customized fetal growth curves more accurate than
      population-based fetal growth curves at predicting abnormalities in fetal growth, defined as
      small-for-gestational age or large-for-gestational age at birth in newborns of high-risk
      pregnancies? Randomly, participants will be assigned to either having fetal growth reported
      by customized or population bases growth curves.
