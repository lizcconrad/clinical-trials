  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr Rajan is investigating a new method to improve local treatment of liver cancer. There is
      evidence that a drug, norepinephrine (NE), has the ability to shrink down normal liver blood
      vessels, but leave tumor vessels wide open. In patients with primary liver cancer, NE will be
      injected directly in the artery that nourishes the liver and the tumor. Real time blood flow
      will be measured using an advanced CT scanner to demonstrate the NE effect on blood vessels.
      If Dr Rajan's hypothesis is confirmed, this drug has great potential to benefit patients
      during local delivery of chemotherapy in the liver artery, diverting it away from normal
      liver and towards the tumor, resulting in less complications and improved tumor kill.

      This study aims to evaluate the blood flow modifications in liver following injection of
      norepinephrine in the hepatic artery. These blood flow variations have never been dynamically
      evaluated before. If indeed blood flow modulation in liver is favorable, the use of
      norepinephrine prior to localized chemotherapy has great potential to enhance treatment and
      diminish side effects. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer, will
      be selected for this study. Included patients will have a trans-arterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) procedure scheduled as treatment for their cancer. During their procedure, they will
      be brought to an advanced CT-scanner. CT perfusion imaging will be performed prior, and after
      the injection of the study drug in the liver artery. Patient's treatment will then be
      completed. Perfusion color maps will illustrate blood flow. Perfusion values will be
      correlated to see how the drug modulates blood flow in tumor and in normal liver.
