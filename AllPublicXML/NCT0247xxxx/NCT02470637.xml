      Primary Objective:

      To assess the dose-response pattern of the glucose consumption (GIR-AUC0-end) of 3 different
      single doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of subcutaneous
      (SC) insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp setting.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the dose proportionality of insulin exposure (INS-AUClast) of 3 different single
      doses of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of SC insulin lispro in a
      euglycemic clamp setting.

      To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of 3 different single doses of Afrezza
      inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of SC insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp
      setting.

      To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of 3 different single doses of Afrezza
      inhaled Technosphere insulin and of 3 single doses of SC insulin lispro in a euglycemic clamp
      setting.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of 3 different single doses of Afrezza inhaled
      Technosphere insulin.

      The total study duration for one patient is approximately 6.7 to 22.7 weeks (minimum to
      maximum duration, excluding screening). The duration of the study includes a screening period
      of 3 to 28 days (D -28 to D -3), 6 treatment periods of 1 or 2 days each (1 overnight stay),
      a washout period of 7 to 28 days (preferentially 7 days between consecutive dosing), and an
      end-of-study visit of 7 to 14 days after the last study drug administration.
