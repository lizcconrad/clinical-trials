      This is a prospective, post market, international, multi-center, randomized trial.

      Patients undergoing coronary angiography with possibility of PCI will be consented to
      participate in the study. Patients who provide informed consent and who meet all eligibility
      criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 to undergo PCI with either OCT, IVUS, or Angiography
      guidance.

      All patients will undergo baseline and post PCI imaging with their randomized modality. In
      addition, the Angiography and IVUS groups will undergo a blinded post-PCI OCT run to allow
      comparison of OCT derived minimum stent area (MSA) in both groups.

      After hospital discharge, all patients will have clinical follow-up at 30 days and 1 year.
