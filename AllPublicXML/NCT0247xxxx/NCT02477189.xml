  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective evaluation of all subjects who successfully received implantation of
      the Silicone Block for correction of soft tissue deformities of the penis. In addition,
      subjects will be sent a questionnaire to complete that will evaluate the subject's ongoing
      satisfaction with the implant and any adverse events that may not have been reported to the
      physician.
