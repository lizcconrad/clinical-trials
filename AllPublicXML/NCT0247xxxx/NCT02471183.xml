  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolls patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treated with inhaled
      treprostinil. During the study, the treatment with inhaled treprostinil will be tapered off
      and simultaneously replaced with an oral treatment (selexipag) targeting the disease in a
      similar way. The purpose of the study is i) to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      oral selexipag in patients who transition from inhaled treprostinil, ii) to investigate the
      effects of oral selexipag on PAH severity and exercise ability before and after transition,
      and iii) to gain new information about the patients experience taking oral selexipag compared
      to inhaled treprostinil. Study participants may stay in the study until the FDA has granted
      marketing authorization.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Sustained Treatment Transition</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A sustained treatment transition is considered if the 3 following criteria are met a) being on study treatment (selexipag) at Week 16, and b) not having a study treatment interruption(s) of a total of 8 days or more prior to Week 16, and c) absence of inhaled treprostinil or any prostanoid treatment after Week 8 up to Week 16.
The percentage of subjects with a sustained treatment transition is calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With WHO Functional Class (FC) Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines 4 classes to classify the functional status of patients with pulmonary hypertension:
Class I (FC I): No limitation of physical activity. Class II (FC II): Slight limitation of physical activity. Class III (FC III): Marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV (FC IV): Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms.
Number of patients with improvement (shift from a higher to a lower class), worsening (shift from a lower to a higher class) or no change in WHO functional class at end of study compared to baseline are determined.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Trough</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a non-encouraged test, which measures the distance (in meters) covered by the subject during a 6-minute walk. It is performed in a 30-meters long flat corridor, where the patient is instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed.
Absolute change from baseline to Week 16 in 6MWD is measured at trough levels of inhaled treprostinil and/or selexipag. The trough level of inhaled treprostinil is defined as the last dose having been taken not less than 4 hours and not more than 48 hours prior to the 6MWT at Visit 1 (screening). The trough level of selexipag was defined as the last dose having been taken not less than 8 hours and not more than 7 days prior to the 6MWT at Visit 5 (Week 16).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Change in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with an increase (&gt; 8% of baseline), maintenance (+/- 8% of baseline), or decrease (&lt; -8% of baseline) in their 6MWD (at trough) from baseline to Week 16. The Â± 8% boundaries for change in 6MWD reflect the approximately 8% coefficient of variation in the reproducibility of the 6MWD.
The trough level of inhaled treprostinil is defined as the last dose having been taken not less than 4 hours and not more than 48 hours prior to the 6MWD test at Visit 1 (screening). The trough level of selexipag was defined as the last dose having been taken not less than 8 hours and not more than 7 days prior to the 6MWD test at Visit 5 (Week 16).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Questionnaire (TSQM II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, Version II (TSQM II) is a validated tool that evaluate the subject's satisfaction with the study treatment. It includes a total of 11 questions related to satisfaction with treatment effectiveness, side effects,convenience, and global satisfaction.
TSQM scores range from 0 to 100 for each domain; a higher score indicates higher satisfaction with treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With WHO Functional Class (FC) Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines 4 classes to classify the functional status of patients with pulmonary hypertension:
Class I (FC I): No limitation of physical activity. Class II (FC II): Slight limitation of physical activity. Class III (FC III): Marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV (FC IV): Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms.
Number of patients with improvement (shift from a higher to a lower class), worsening (shift from a lower to a higher class) or no change in WHO functional class at end of study compared to baseline are determined.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Trough</title>
        <description>The 6MWT is a non-encouraged test, which measures the distance (in meters) covered by the subject during a 6-minute walk. It is performed in a 30-meters long flat corridor, where the patient is instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed.
Absolute change from baseline to Week 16 in 6MWD is measured at trough levels of inhaled treprostinil and/or selexipag. The trough level of inhaled treprostinil is defined as the last dose having been taken not less than 4 hours and not more than 48 hours prior to the 6MWT at Visit 1 (screening). The trough level of selexipag was defined as the last dose having been taken not less than 8 hours and not more than 7 days prior to the 6MWT at Visit 5 (Week 16).</description>
