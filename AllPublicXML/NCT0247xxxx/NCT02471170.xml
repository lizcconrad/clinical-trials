      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples to detect potential markers of
      pancreatic cancer in the blood and link these findings to medical and health information.
      Information from this study may help to provide insight into the detection of pancreas cancer
      in the blood before it can be found by other methods or provide a method of monitoring the
      status of pancreatic cancer throughout a treatment course. Another purpose of this study is
      to collect blood to create a biobank.
