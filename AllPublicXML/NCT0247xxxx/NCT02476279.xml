  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pancreatitis is the most frequent complication of endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), accounting for substantial morbidity, occasional mortality,
      and increased health care expenditures. Until recently, the only effective method of
      preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) had been prophylactic pancreatic stent placement
      (PSP), an intervention that is costly, time consuming, technically challenging, and
      potentially dangerous. The investigators recently reported the results of a large randomized
      controlled trial demonstrating that rectal indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug, reduced the risk of pancreatitis after ERCP in high-risk patients, most of whom (&gt;80%)
      had received a pancreatic stent. Secondary analysis of this RCT suggested that subjects who
      received indomethacin alone were less likely to develop PEP than those who received a
      pancreatic stent alone or the combination of indomethacin and stent, even after adjusting for
      underlying differences in subject risk. If indomethacin were to obviate the need for PSP,
      major clinical and cost benefits in ERCP practice could be realized.

      Objective: To assess whether rectal indomethacin alone is non-inferior to the combination of
      rectal indomethacin and prophylactic pancreatic stent placement for preventing post-ERCP
      pancreatitis in high-risk cases.

      Methods: Comparative effectiveness multi-center non-inferiority trial of rectal indomethacin
      alone vs. the combination of rectal indomethacin and prophylactic pancreatic stent placement
      for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. One thousand four hundred
      and thirty subjects at elevated risk for PEP who would normally receive a pancreatic stent
      for prophylaxis will be randomized to indomethacin alone or the combination of indomethacin
      and PSP. The proportion of patients developing PEP and moderate-severe PEP will be compared.
      In addition, the investigators will establish a quality-assured central repository of
      biological specimens obtained from study participants, permitting future translational
      research elucidating the molecular and genetic mechanisms of PEP, as well as the mechanisms
      by which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prevent this complication.
