  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a Cognitive and Behavioral group Therapy
      (CBT) + Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) decreased relapses and hospitalizations
      and improved outcomes (depressive and manic symptoms, self-esteem, and quality of life) in a
      large sample of refractory bipolar I patients on mood stabilizers.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, various controlled studies showed that psychoeducational interventions have
      been effective in decreasing relapse and improving outcomes for bipolar disorders. However,
      samples were often small, compromising statistical power, and with a large variety of
      patients. The investigators therefore tested if a CBT group psychoeducation program + MBCT
      decreased relapses and improved outcomes in a large sample of refractory bipolar I patients
      on mood stabilizers. Patients were tested at recruitment, at 6-month follow-up CBT and at
      2-month follow-up MBCT using clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires. The primary
      outcome measure of efficacy was relapse during the follow-up requiring either
      hospitalization, modification of treatment or HDRS ≥ 16 or MRS ≥ 6. The secondary outcome
      measure was symptomatic and functional improvement.
