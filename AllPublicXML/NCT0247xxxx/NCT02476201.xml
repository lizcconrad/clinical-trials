  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess prospectively at 6 months the percentage of responder
      patients implanted with a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT-D) device and a Quartet Left
      Ventricular (LV) quadripolar lead and with the MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) feature activated.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to measure prospectively at 6 months the percentage of
      responder* patients implanted with a Quartet LV quadripolar lead and with the MultiPoint
      Pacing feature activated compared with No Pacing at baseline.

      *A positive CRT response is defined as an improvement of more than 15 % in Left Ventricular
      End Systolic Volume (LVESV) at 6 months post-implant, measured by Echocardiography.
