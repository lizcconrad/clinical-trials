  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with a wide range of symptoms impacting a number of different
      domains, including cognitive impairment. Given the array of cognitive deficits associated
      with schizophrenia and their relationship to daily functioning, numerous research groups have
      examined the impact of cognitive remediation on many aspects of cognition. However, it is
      currently unclear as to which domains of cognition should be targeted to produce the most
      widespread and durable benefits for schizophrenia patients. It may be the case that targeting
      lower-level cognitive processes that are important for higher-level and more complex aspects
      of cognition may produce the most widespread benefits in cognition and everyday functioning.
      Relatively few studies have examined the effects of working memory or processing speed
      training on individuals with schizophrenia, as most studies examine broad-based remediation
      programs. Thus, there is a need for targeted working memory and processing speed training
      studies to better understand the mechanisms of cognitive enhancement through training in
      patients. This study will aim to: 1) investigate near-transfer gains associated with working
      memory and processing speed training in schizophrenia patients, 2) investigate far-transfer
      gains associated with working memory and processing speed training (i.e., gains in other
      neurocognitive domains and social cognition), and 3) investigate real-world gains associated
      with training (i.e., gains in daily functioning). Towards this aim, 81 schizophrenia patients
      will be recruited and randomly assigned to a working memory training group, a processing
      speed training group, or a no training control group. Training will be completed at home for
      30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for a total of 10 weeks. Neurocognitive, social
      cognitive, and daily functioning measures will be administered both pre- and post-training to
      detect training-related gains.

    <description>The neurocognitive training program will be provided by an online platform called BrainGymmer (https://www.braingymmer.com/en/brain-games/). Users will receive an account where they will only have access to the training games they have been assigned to and where their activity will be logged. One experimental group will complete the working memory training, which involves three games: N-back, Multi-Memory, and Moving Memory. These games are designed to engage processes involving updating and manipulation of information. All of the training games are adaptive. Participants randomized to this cognitive training arm will complete the training games for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a week, for a total of 10 weeks.</description>
