  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well denosumab works in treating patients with osteosarcoma
      that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as denosumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether denosumab therapy either increases the disease control rate at 4
      months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma as compared to historical
      Children's Oncology Group (COG) experience or denosumab therapy produces an objective
      response rate greater than 5% (Cohort 1).

      II. To determine whether denosumab therapy increases the disease control rate at 12 months in
      patients with recurrent resected osteosarcoma as compared to historical COG experience
      (Cohort 2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of denosumab in
      subjects with recurrent osteosarcoma.

      II. To describe the tolerability of denosumab in subjects with recurrent osteosarcoma.

      III. To report the disease control rate and objective response rate for patients with
      recurrent osteosarcoma limited to bone.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate biological markers potentially associated with response to denosumab in
      patients with recurrent osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive denosumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 (days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 only).
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks (28 days) for up to 24 months or 26 courses, whichever occurs
      first, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
