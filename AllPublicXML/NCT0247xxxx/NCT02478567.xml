      Randomized crossover trial evaluating the impact of exercise training sequence of
      axioscapular and rotator cuff exercises in patients diagnosed with subacromial impingement
      syndrome.

      While physical therapy is an effective element in the rehabilitation of rotator cuff (RC)
      disease, the most effective sequence of training interventions has not been defined. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in pain or function in
      patients who are given RC strengthening prior to or after initiating scapular stabilization
      exercises.

      The study was a prospective randomized crossover design. 26 men and 14 women, mean age 51,
      diagnosed with subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) were randomly assigned to one of two
      groups for a comprehensive and standardized rehabilitation program over six visits at an
      orthopedic outpatient clinic. One group was prescribed a 4-week program of scapular
      stabilization exercises while the other group began with RC strengthening exercises. The
      crossover design had each group add the previously excluded four exercises to their second
      month of rehabilitation.
