      The participants will complete a series of balance assessments with a licensed physical (PT)
      or occupational therapist (OT) or qualified research assistant (RA) at Blue Marble Game Co or
      in their respective homes at the start of the study, at crossover and upon completion of the
      study. During this study a PT, OT, or RA trained in fall risk management will supervise the
      instruction and practice by participants of the home exercise programs during the initial 2-3
      hour introduction to the study activities. Participants will be asked to exercise 3/week for
      one month then crossover to the alternative exercise program and exercise 3/week for a second
      month.

      The participants will complete a series of balance assessments with a licensed physical (PT)
      or occupational therapist (OT) or qualified research assistant (RA) at Blue Marble Game Co or
      in their respective homes at the start of the study, at cross over and upon completion of the
      study. During this study a PT, OT, or RA trained in fall risk management will supervise the
      instruction and practice by participants of the home exercise programs during the initial 2-3
      hour introduction to the study activities. Participants will be asked to exercise 3/week for
      one month then crossover to the alternative exercise program and exercise 3/week for a second
      month. The PT, OT, or RA will determine that the participant is competent to perform the home
      exercise programs safely, with no more than a normal risk of falls or withdraw the
      participant from the study. The participant's score on the standard version of the Falls Risk
      Questionnaire, Single Leg Stance Test, and Chair Rise Test will be recorded and stored on a
      password protected computer in a locked office. Once the data has been stored electronically,
      paper data collection sheets will be placed in a confidential bin for shredding. Exercise
      Data will be captured using a) the Health In Motion software via the Kinect Sensor and stored
      on the Blue Marble secure server and b) via a daily exercise log provided to the participant
      in paper form.

    <description>A laptop computer &amp; MS Kinect camera will be connected to a 40&quot; TV to deliver guided fall prevention exercises. Research staff will train the participants in the use of the computerized program and be supervised performing the exercises during the instruction period. Then participants will be instructed to exercise 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Half of the participants will begin the study with the computerized version of the home exercise program while the other half begins with the paper booklet version of the home exercise program. After one month the arms will cross over.</description>

    <description>A paper booklet with pictures and written instructions, and an exercise log for the home exercise program will be given to half of the participants. Participants will be carefully instructed in performing the exercises correctly and then asked to perform the exercises 3 times per week for one month. Participants who began the study with the paper exercise program will switch to the computerized version of the exercise program for the second month.</description>
