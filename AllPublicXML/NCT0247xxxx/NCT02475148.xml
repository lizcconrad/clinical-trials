  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-54175446
      versus placebo after single oral dose administration (ascending dose levels), to determine
      the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or the safety and tolerability at exposures resulting in
      full target engagement for at least 24 hours in all participants (whichever comes first), to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54175446 in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      urine and to investigate the effect of food (high fat/high calorie) on the pharmacokinetics
      of JNJ 54175446 after single oral dose administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single ascending dose study in
      healthy participants for JNJ-54175446. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase
      (between 21 and 2 days prior to dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase (8 days;
      Part 1 and Part 3) or an open-label treatment phase (8 days; Part 2), and a follow-up
      examination (within 14 to 21 days after dose administration). The maximal study duration for
      a participant will not exceed 6 weeks. In each cohort of Part 1 (6 cohorts) and Part 3 (1
      cohort), participants will be randomly assigned to receive JNJ-54175446 or matching placebo
      and in cohort of part 2, all participants will be assigned to JNJ-54175446 treatment. In part
      1, primarily maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be assessed, along with safety and
      tolerability of JNJ-54175446. In part 2, pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-54175446 in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be assessed. In part 3, the effect of food on the plasma PK of
      JNJ-54175446 in young healthy male participants will be assessed. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be
             not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the subject's
             source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control e.g., either condom with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm
             or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men
             must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last
             dose of study drug. In addition, their female partner should also use an appropriate
             method of birth control for at least the same duration

        For Part 1 and 3:

        - Healthy male participants between 18 and 54 years of age, inclusive

        For Part 2:

          -  Healthy male or female participants between 55 and 75 years of age, inclusive

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of both physical and neurological examination
             performed at screening and at admission to the clinical unit

          -  Women must not be of childbearing potential (i.e., must be postmenopausal with
             amenorrhea for at least 12 months); permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion,
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy); or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of or current liver or renal insufficiency; significant
             cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic
             (including coagulation disorders), rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic
             disturbances, any inflammatory illness or any other illness that the Investigator
             considers should exclude the participant

          -  Participant has any liver function test (including alanine aminotransferase [ALT],
             aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyltransferase [gamma-GT], alkaline
             phosphatase [ALP] and bilirubin) at screening exceeding the upper limit of normal

          -  Participant has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C
             antibody (anti-HCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests
             positive for HBsAg or anti-HCV at Screening

          -  Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or
             tests positive for HIV at Screening

          -  Participant has a Prothrombin time [PT] &gt;14 seconds and/or an activated partial
             thromboplastin time [aPTT] &gt;35 seconds
