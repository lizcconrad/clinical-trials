  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the combination of
      GDC-0919 and atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
      incurable solid malignancy that has progressed after available standard therapy or for which
      standard therapy is ineffective, intolerable, or inappropriate. Participants will be enrolled
      in two stages, including a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage.

    <description>Approximately 6 to 65 participants will be enrolled and treated at escalating doses of GDC-0919 in combination with fixed-dose atezolizumab. Treatment may continue until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression with an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. Successive groups of at least 3 participants will be evaluated during a 21-day window for DLTs, which will determine the enrollment and dosing for subsequent cohorts in the dose-escalation stage. The MTD or MAD, whichever is reached first, will be considered for the expansion stage.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive GDC-0919 by mouth (PO) twice daily (BID), specifically every 12 hours. During the dose-escalation stage, the first cohort will receive GDC-0919 at a starting dose of 50 mg PO BID. Dosing will commence on Day -1 for Cycle 1 and follow subsequent 21-day (Days 1 to 21) dosing cycles. The dose will be modified based upon evaluation of DLTs, with single dose escalations not to exceed 2.5-fold of the previous dose. The proposed dosages for evaluation are 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 1000 mg PO BID. During the expansion stage, selected solid tumor types will be treated at the MTD or MAD as determined during the dose-escalation stage.</description>
