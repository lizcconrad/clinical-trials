    <textblock>
      This study considers whether treatment effects in response to spinal manipulative therapy for
      individuals experiencing low back pain are dependent upon the context in which the
      intervention is provided. Half of the participants will receive spinal manipulative therapy
      with encouragement to interact with the provider and information to enhance expectations for
      the effectiveness of the intervention. The other half will receive spinal manipulative
      therapy with minimal interaction with the provider.

Scored from 1=Definitely not to 5= definitely yes; 3) . How would you rate the overall results of the intervention you received in this study for low back pain?
