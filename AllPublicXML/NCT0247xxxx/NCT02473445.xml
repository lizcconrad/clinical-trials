      A long-term extension study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cysteamine
      bitartrate delayed-release capsules (RP103) in children with inherited mitochondrial diseases
      who previously enrolled into study RP103-MITO-001 (NCT02023866).

      Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases associated with nuclear or mitochondrial
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations that impair the respiratory chain. These include, but
      are not limited to the following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy;
      myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic
      acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS); Kearn-Sayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing
      encephalopathy (Leigh Syndrome); polymerase gamma (POLG)-related disorders
      (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia,
      Autosomal Recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy
      Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, POLG-Related Ataxia
      Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome
      (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome or
      polyneuropathy-ophthalmoplegia-leukoencephalopathy- Intestinal pseudoobstruction (POLIP)
      syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and other syndromes due to multiple
      mitochondrial DNA deletions.

      Patients completing study RP103-MITO-001 (NCT02023866) are eligible for enrollment into the
      extension study RP103-MITO-002 if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled.
      Subjects continue on the last total daily dose of cysteamine bitartrate delayed-release
      capsules taken during RP103-MITO-001. Dose-adjustments are permitted.

    <description>The NPMDS evaluates the progression of mitochondrial disease in pediatric patients in 4 domains:
I - Current Function (vision, hearing, communication, feeding, and mobility) with scores ranging from 0 to 21;
II - System Specific Involvement (seizures, encephalopathy, bleeding diathesis or coagulation defects, gastrointestinal, endocrine, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, liver, and blood) with scores ranging from 0 to 30.
III - Current Clinical Assessment (growth and development over past 6 months, vision, strabismus and eye movement, myopathy, ataxia, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and neuropathy) with scores ranging from 0 to 28;
IV - Quality of Life with scores ranging from 0 to 25. For sections I-III, higher scores reflect more severe disease. For Section IV, a higher score reflects a lower quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) Score</title>
        <description>The NPMDS evaluates the progression of mitochondrial disease in pediatric patients in 4 domains:
I - Current Function (vision, hearing, communication, feeding, and mobility) with scores ranging from 0 to 21;
II - System Specific Involvement (seizures, encephalopathy, bleeding diathesis or coagulation defects, gastrointestinal, endocrine, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, liver, and blood) with scores ranging from 0 to 30.
III - Current Clinical Assessment (growth and development over past 6 months, vision, strabismus and eye movement, myopathy, ataxia, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and neuropathy) with scores ranging from 0 to 28;
IV - Quality of Life with scores ranging from 0 to 25. For sections I-III, higher scores reflect more severe disease. For Section IV, a higher score reflects a lower quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 months and Study Exit (up to 24 Months)</time_frame>
        <population>The study was closed prematurely due to lack of efficacy demonstrated in base study RP103-MITO-001. As a result, only a limited amount of data was collected for patients that were enrolled prior to termination.
