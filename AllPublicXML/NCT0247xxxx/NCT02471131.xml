  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with a lifetime risk of
      developing AF of 1 in 4 people aged over 40. Stroke remains the most feared complication of
      AF with an increase in risk by 5-fold, and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality.
      The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the origin for more than 90% of the emboli in non-valvular
      AF. The WATCHMANâ„¢ Left Atrial Closure Device (WATCHMAN Device, Boston Scientific) reduces the
      risk of stroke by closing off the LAA. During hybrid procedures for AF, LAA occlusion with
      epicardial devices is known to be difficult and not free of risks.It thus will be interesting
      to study the safety and feasibility of endocardial WATCHMAN Device implantation in a hybrid
      ablation approach.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented paroxysmal or (long-standing) persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation,

          -  Eligible at least for short-term OAC therapy,

          -  No other conditions that would require long-term OAC therapy, suggested by current
             standard medical practice, and thus is eligible to stop OAC if the LAA is sealed,

          -  Calculated CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 or more,

          -  18 years of age or older, able and willing to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure,

          -  Current thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100x10E9/L) or anemia (hemoglobin &lt;6.2 mmol/L),

          -  Active infection or sepsis,

          -  Resting heart rate &gt; 110 beats per minute,

          -  Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the last 30
             days,

          -  Recent myocardial infarction (within 3 months),

          -  Transient case of AF (i.e., secondary to recent cardiac surgery (within 3 months)),

          -  Implanted mechanical valve prosthesis,

          -  History of obliterated LAA,

          -  History of heart transplantation,

          -  Symptomatic carotid disease (i.e., carotid stenosis &gt;50% associated with ipsilateral
             transient or visual ischemic attack evidenced by amaurosis fugax, ipsilateral
             hemispheric TIAs or ipsilateral stroke within 6 months),

          -  Necessity to use long-term OAC,

          -  Contraindication for use of OAC or dual anti-platelet therapy,

          -  Contraindication for use of aspirin,

          -  Life expectancy less than 2 years,

          -  Participation in any other clinical study involving an investigational drug or device.

        Echocardiographic Exclusion Criteria (as assessed via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)
        or TEE) for this study are:

          -  Intracardiac thrombus as visualized by TEE within 2 days prior to implant,

          -  High risk patent foramen ovale,

          -  Current atrial septal defect and/or previous atrial septal repair or closure device,

          -  Significant mitral valve stenosis (i.e., MV 4. 5 cm2),

          -  Existing pericardial effusion of &gt;3 mm,

          -  Complex atheroma with mobile plaque of the descending aorta and/or aortic arch,

          -  Cardiac tumor.
