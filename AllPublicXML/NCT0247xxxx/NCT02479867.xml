      Comparative randomized, single dose, two-way crossover open-label study to determine the
      bioequivalence of Cefadroxil from Duricef 1 gm Film Coated tablets(Smthkline Beecham
      Egypt,LLC affiliated co. to GalaxoSmithKline ) and Biodroxil 1 gm Film Coated tablets (Kahira
      Pharm &amp;Chem .Ind. Co . for Novartis Pharma ) after a single oral dose administration of each
      to healthy adults under fasting conditions.

      14 blood samples will be drawn in each period. The total volume of blood will not exceed 200
      ml throughout the whole study. 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00,
      6.00, 8.00, 10.00 and 12.00 hours., Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and
      AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVAusing 5% significance
      level for transformed (with the 90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax,
      AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e.

      The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios forCmax, AUC0→t
      and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%.
