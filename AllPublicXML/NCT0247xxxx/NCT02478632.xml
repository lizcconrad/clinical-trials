    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate any change from baseline in bone mineral density
      (BMD) in subjects following the switch from a triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen
      containing Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) - sparing two - drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV) in
      subjects participating in the parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2).

      This open-label, parallel group, study is a sub-study which will recruit subjects who are
      receiving ART regimens which include TDF at the time of randomization to receive treatment in
      one of two identical parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2). These are Phase
      III, randomised, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority studies evaluating
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching to DTG plus RPV from current integrase
      inhibitor (INI)-, non NNRTI-, or protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimen in
      HIV-1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed, having HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      levels &lt;50 copies per millilitre (c/mL). Randomisation in the parent studies will be
      stratified by baseline third agent class (INI, NNRTI, or PI), age group (&lt; or =&gt;50 years old)
      and participation in this Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) sub-study, therefore there
      will also be balance across the treatment arms in this sub-study both overall and with
      respect to baseline third agent class and age at entry.

      The study population will include approximately 75 evaluable subjects recruited from the
      Early Switch DTG + RPV treatment group of the parent studies 201636 and 201637, and
      approximately 75 evaluable subjects from the Late Switch group who continue their current
      antiretroviral therapy (CAR) through to Week 52 across both the 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1
      and SWORD-2) studies. Subjects participating in study 202094 will have DEXA scans performed
      at Day 1 and at study Weeks 48, 100 and 148 in parallel with the corresponding scheduled
      visits in the parent studies.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in BMD (expressed as areal density in g/cm2) as specified by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans of the left 'total hip' which included the femoral neck, trochanter and inter-trochanter areas was assessed by areal density at Baseline and Week 48. The difference is adjusted percent change from Baseline to Week 48 between treatment groups. The estimated value in the statistical analysis is this difference and the upper and lower limit values shown are the 95% confidence intervals. The Baseline was considered as Visit 1 and percent change from Baseline was calculated as Value at Week 48 minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to compare the difference. The analysis was performed on Intent-to-Treat exposed DEXA (ITT-ED) Population which comprised of all participants in the ITT-E Population who received at least one dose of study treatment, and who were registered for the 202094 study.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine BMD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in BMD as specified by DEXA scans of the 'lumbar spine' which included the first lumbar vertebra (L1) to the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) was assessed by areal density at Baseline and Week 48. The difference is adjusted percent change from Baseline to Week 48 between treatment groups. The estimated value in the statitical analysis is this difference and the upper and lower limit values shown are the 95% confidence intervals. The Baseline was considered as Visit 1 value and percent change from Baseline was calculated as Value at Week 48 minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. An ANCOVA model adjusted for the Baseline BMD value, age at study entry and Baseline BMI was used to compare the difference in percentage change from Baseline at week 48 in lumbar spine BMD between the DTG+RPV and CAR arms. Mean and 95 percent CI were estimated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine and Total Hip BMD Assessed by T-score and Z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in lumbar spine and total hip BMD was assessed by T-scores and Z-scores at Baseline and Week 48. Change from Baseline (Day 1) was calculated as the value at Week 48 minus Baseline. T-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean BMD of a 30-year-old of the same sex. Caucasian reference values were used for all subjects to calculate T-scores. T-score values &gt; -1.0 are considered normal, T-score values &lt; -1.0 to &gt; -2.5 indicate osteopenia and T-score values &lt;= -2.5 indicate osteoporosis. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean BMD for a reference population of same age and sex and in this study Caucasian reference values were used in calculation of Z-scores. Most BMD values, statistically, would fall within + or - 3 standard deviations of what is considered normal.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine and Total Hip BMD by Baseline Third Agent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from Baseline (Day 1) to Week 48 in total hip and lumbar spine BMD (expressed as areal density in g/cm2) assessed by third agent class at Baseline. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as value at Week 48 minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. An ANCOVA model adjusted for Baseline BMD values was used to compare the difference in percent change from Baseline to Week 48 in total hip BMD or in lumbar spine BMD between the DTG+RPV and CAR arms by third agent class: integrase inhibitor (INSTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI). Mean and 95 percent CI were estimated. For BMD expressed as areal density (g/ cm2 ), most BMD values, statistically, would fall within + or - 3 standard deviations of what is considered normal. Only those participants with evaluable DEXA scans at Baseline and Week 48 were included.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants from the early switch dolutegravir (DTG) plus rilpivirine (RPV) treatment group and from the late switch group who continue their current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) through to Week 52 across both the NCT02429791 and NCT02422797 were included in this sub-study 202094. The results presented are the Week 48 interim analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 151 participants infected with HIV-1 were screened, of which, 49 were screen failures and 102 were registered to study 202094. The study included an early switch phase and a late switch phase. DEXA-related results are based on those participants with evaluable DEXA scans at both Day 1 and Week 48 (DTG+RPV: 46, CAR:35).</pre_assignment_details>

The difference is adjusted percent change from Baseline to Week 48 between treatment groups. The estimated value in the statistical analysis is this difference and the upper and lower limit values shown are the 95% confidence intervals. The Baseline was considered as Visit 1 and percent change from Baseline was calculated as Value at Week 48 minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to compare the difference. The analysis was performed on Intent-to-Treat exposed DEXA (ITT-ED) Population which comprised of all participants in the ITT-E Population who received at least one dose of study treatment, and who were registered for the 202094 study.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine BMD</title>
        <description>Percent change in BMD as specified by DEXA scans of the 'lumbar spine' which included the first lumbar vertebra (L1) to the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) was assessed by areal density at Baseline and Week 48. The difference is adjusted percent change from Baseline to Week 48 between treatment groups. The estimated value in the statitical analysis is this difference and the upper and lower limit values shown are the 95% confidence intervals. The Baseline was considered as Visit 1 value and percent change from Baseline was calculated as Value at Week 48 minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. An ANCOVA model adjusted for the Baseline BMD value, age at study entry and Baseline BMI was used to compare the difference in percentage change from Baseline at week 48 in lumbar spine BMD between the DTG+RPV and CAR arms. Mean and 95 percent CI were estimated.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine and Total Hip BMD Assessed by T-score and Z-score</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in lumbar spine and total hip BMD was assessed by T-scores and Z-scores at Baseline and Week 48. Change from Baseline (Day 1) was calculated as the value at Week 48 minus Baseline. T-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean BMD of a 30-year-old of the same sex. Caucasian reference values were used for all subjects to calculate T-scores. T-score values &gt; -1.0 are considered normal, T-score values &lt; -1.0 to &gt; -2.5 indicate osteopenia and T-score values &lt;= -2.5 indicate osteoporosis. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean BMD for a reference population of same age and sex and in this study Caucasian reference values were used in calculation of Z-scores. Most BMD values, statistically, would fall within + or – 3 standard deviations of what is considered normal.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine and Total Hip BMD by Baseline Third Agent</title>
        <description>Percent change from Baseline (Day 1) to Week 48 in total hip and lumbar spine BMD (expressed as areal density in g/cm2) assessed by third agent class at Baseline. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as value at Week 48 minus Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. An ANCOVA model adjusted for Baseline BMD values was used to compare the difference in percent change from Baseline to Week 48 in total hip BMD or in lumbar spine BMD between the DTG+RPV and CAR arms by third agent class: integrase inhibitor (INSTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI). Mean and 95 percent CI were estimated. For BMD expressed as areal density (g/ cm2 ), most BMD values, statistically, would fall within + or – 3 standard deviations of what is considered normal. Only those participants with evaluable DEXA scans at Baseline and Week 48 were included.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine and Total Hip BMD T-scores and Z-scores by Baseline Third Agent</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in lumbar spine and total hip BMD was assessed by T-scores and Z-scores at Baseline and Week 48. Change from Baseline (Day 1) was calculated as the value at Week 48 minus Baseline. T-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean BMD of a 30-year-old of the same sex. Caucasian reference values were used for all subjects to calculate T-scores. T-score values &gt; -1.0 are considered normal, T-score values &lt; -1.0 to &gt; -2.5 indicate osteopenia and T-score values &lt;= -2.5 indicate osteoporosis. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean BMD for a reference population of same age and sex and in this study Caucasian reference values were used in calculation of Z-scores. Most BMD values, statistically, would fall within + or – 3 standard deviations of what is considered normal.</description>
