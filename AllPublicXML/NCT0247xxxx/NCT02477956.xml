  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery patients tend to have malabsorption of many micronutrients such as B12,
      Iron and vitamin D postoperative. So in this study, a monthly high dose of vitamin D3 is
      giving to patients with their routine supplements and followed up for 6 months.

      Hypothesis:Bariatric surgery subjects taking monthly high dose cholecalciferol supplements in
      addition to the standard vitamin D protocol will have a significant rise in serum vitamin D
      levels compared to the subjects taking only the usual vitamin D protocol.

      Sun exposure and supplement use questionnaire:

      A registered dietitian asked each subject for information on sun exposure, vitamins,
      medications, and any other supplement usage before each blood sample was taken.

      Lab analysis included serum hydroxy vitamin D levels pre and 3 months postoperative.

      Descriptive statistics which include both the means and standard deviations were calculated
      on the study variables. A paired sample t-test was used to determine if there was a
      significant difference in mean values pre and post vitamin D supplementation. An independent
      sample t-test was used to assess for significant differences in group (control vs. vitamin D
      supplement) means. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
      analyses were done using SPSS Version 21 (SPSS, Chicago, III, USA).

    <description>To determine if there is a significant difference in mean serum vitamin D levels in the group of subjects taking the standard vitamin D protocol compared to subjects taking the standard vitamin D protocol with added monthly high dose cholecalciferol after bariatric surgery. This outcome measure is done by analysis of serum 25-OH vitamin D levels.</description>
