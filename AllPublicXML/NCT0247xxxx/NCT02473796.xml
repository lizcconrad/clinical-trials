      Melghat is poorly developed tribal area in India with very high child mortality &amp;
      malnutrition prevalence (grossly inadequate medical facilities). Important health problems.
      Malnutrition , Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Anaemia, Malaria, Diarrhoea, Premature and L. B. W.
      babies, Neonatal sepsis, Feeding problem, Birth asphyxia. The investigators developed a Home
      Based Child Care (HBCC) model to reduce neonatal mortality rate (NMR), infant mortality rate
      (IMR), under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) and severe malnutrition(SM) in this region.

      Melghat.

      Need of project :

      Melghat is known for highest U5MR in Maharashtra. Overall aims and importance of the
      research:. The results obtained in this area will be applicable for reducing children
      mortality and malnutrition in other parts of Melghat and all other tribal areas of India.

      Methodology: RCT-Home based child care (HBCC) by trained village health workers .(ARI,
      Diarrhoea, Malaria clinically &amp; Neonatal care) in 19 villages. Strengthening of existing
      government ICDS and health system.

      A. Objectives:

        1. To reduce NMR from existing 54 ( year 2004) to 33.6 per 1000 live births in usual
           residents population of 17000 (from 19 villages in tribal area of Melghat ) over a
           period of 5 years.

        2. To reduce the IMR from existing 90 (year 2004) to 52.65 per 1000 live births in above
           area.

        3. To reduce the U5MR from existing 140 (year 2006) to 72.1 per 1000 live births in above
           area.

        4. To reduce the prevalence of severe malnutrition (under 5 children ) from existing 9.5%
           (year 2004) to 4.55% in above area.

      B. Detailed research plan. I. Study design: Randomised Control Trial. The Melghat area was
      divided into 5 clusters. 8 villages were randomly selected from each cluster by lottery
      method. All under 5 children who are ill will be treated by trained VHW.

      II. Study period: January 1st, 2004 to 31st April, 2010. III. Study area: 19 villages for
      intervention and control area with Population of 14888 &amp; 16310 respectively.

      IV) Contents of the home based child health Package:

      A. Provision of home based health care. It comprises provision of home-based health care to
      pregnant mothers and under 5 children through a trained semi-literate female village health
      worker (VHW) resident of the same village under medical supervision by trained medical
      supervisor.

      Arms Experimental: Home based child care The home based child care included treatment of
      various childhood illnesses by VHWs, improving hygiene and nutrition among children and women
      through health education.

      sepsis with Gentamicin once daily (5 mg for 10 days for preterm babies with birth weight
      &lt;2000g; 7 mg for birth weight 2000-2500 gm or as per gentamicin chart for 7 days for normal
      term &amp; weight ) by intramuscular injection.

      Acute respiratory infection was treated with co-trimoxazole syrup BID (2.5 ml for age 1-2
      months, 5 ml for age 2 months - 1 year, 7.5 ml for age 1 - 5 years).

      Diarrheal illness was treated with ORS, furoxone (5 ml 8 hourly for 3 days) and metronidazole
      syrup (5 ml 8 hourly for 7 days).

      Malaria was treated with Syrup chloroquine (for 1 month to 1 year- 5 ml first dose , 2.5 ml
      after 6 hours, 2.5 ml after 12 hours , 2.5 ml after 12 hours). Syrup paracetamol was given

      traditional care. xiii) TBAs involvement xiv) Placement of the supervisor VII.

        1. The total duration of training for supervisors and VHWs is 45 days. 2. TBAs are trained
           in three workshops each of two-day duration.

      VIII. Collection of Vital Statistics: VHWs will collect death and birth records. The vital
      statistics supervisor will supervise it. Retrospective surveyor will conduct house-to-house
      survey every six months to collect these data independently. TBAs will assist.

      IX. Monitoring &amp; Evaluation of project:

      Monitoring indicators for the objective:

      Monitor monthly: No. of pregnant ladies, VHW attendance during deliveries, No. of neonates
      started breast feeding within 60 min, No. of patients treated, etc.

      Evaluation of project:
