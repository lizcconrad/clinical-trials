      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Brainsway Deep TMS
      (DTMS) for the treatment of PTSD.

    <textblock>
      Deep TMS in conjunction with brief trauma exposure will be compared to sham treatment in
      conjunction with brief trauma exposure, in a multicenter, randomized, controlled study for
      the treatment of PTSD. Study duration is 9 weeks, consisting of 4 weeks of treatment and a 5
      week and 9 week follow-up visit. Subjects will be randomized to real or sham treatment
      stratified by site. The design is meant to demonstrate that the device shows superiority
      compared to sham treatment at the 5 week follow-up visit and at the 9 week follow-up visit, 1
      month post-treatment.
