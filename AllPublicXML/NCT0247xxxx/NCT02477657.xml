    <textblock>
      Malignant ascites leads to significant morbidity in patients with terminal cancer.
      Paracentesis can provide relief, but repeat hospital visits, pain, and short duration of
      relief after paracentesis are detrimental to quality of life(QOL). Two devices are available
      as alternatives to paracentesis. The impact of either device on QOL has not fully been
      explored. A pilot nonrandomized trial measuring palliative care QOL and ascites symptom
      relief using validated survey instruments is proposed.
