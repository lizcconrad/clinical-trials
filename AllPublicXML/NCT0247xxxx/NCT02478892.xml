      The study is a prospective, observational, case-control study evaluating the utility of
      endoscopic ultrasound for the identification of preneoplastic and neoplastic pancreatic
      lesions in patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer, specifically those with BRCA1/2
      mutations.
