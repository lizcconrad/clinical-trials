    <textblock>
      This prospective annual release study is designed to evaluate the safety of 3 new influenza
      virus vaccine strains to be included in FluMist Quadrivalent for the 2015-2016 influenza
      season

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study will enroll
      approximately 300 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. Eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of trivalent vaccine or placebo
      by intranasal spray. Randomization will be stratified by site. This study will be conducted
      at 3 sites in the United States of America. Each participant will receive 1 dose of
      investigational product on Day 1. The duration of study participation for each participant is
      the time from study vaccination through 181 days after study vaccination.

    <description>Solicited symptoms are predefined symptoms or events specifically inquired about and assessed daily after vaccine administration up to 15 days after vaccination. The solicited symptoms include fever greater than (&gt;) 100.0 degrees F (37.8 degrees Celsius), runny nose, sore throat, cough, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, decreased activity and headache. Results were reported for all solicited symptoms except fever &gt;=101 degrees F (reported as primary outcome) within 8 days after vaccination and all solicited symptoms within 15 days after vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 8 and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs were events between administration of study drug and up to 15 days after vaccination that are absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Results were given for AEs reported within 8 days and 15 days after vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs) and New Onset Chronic Disease (NOCDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 29 and 181</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent SAEs were serious events between administration of study drug and up to 181 days after the dose that are absent before treatment or that worsen relative to pretreatment state. An NOCD is a newly diagnosed medical condition that is of a chronic, ongoing nature and is assessed by the investigator as medically significant. Results were given for TESAEs and NOCDs reported within 29 days and 181 days after vaccination.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent SAEs were serious events between administration of study drug and up to 181 days after the dose that are absent before treatment or that worsen relative to pretreatment state. An NOCD is a newly diagnosed medical condition that is of a chronic, ongoing nature and is assessed by the investigator as medically significant. Results were given for TESAEs and NOCDs reported within 29 days and 181 days after vaccination.</description>
