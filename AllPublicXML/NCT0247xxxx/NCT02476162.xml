    <textblock>
      Second malignant neoplasms and cardiac late effects are primary drivers of serious
      non-recurrence morbidity and mortality in long term childhood cancer survivors. Cardiac late
      effects have been most prominently associated with exposure to high doses of anthracyclines
      or chest radiation. While increased recognition of late effects has resulted in risk-targeted
      therapy and reductions in use of high dose radiation and anthracyclines for many patients,
      these cardiotoxic exposures continue to be essential components of curative childhood cancer
      therapy. In addition, as survivors age they are increasingly susceptible to other general
      risk factors for cardiovascular disease recognized in the general population, such as
      hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.

      This study will evaluate a high blood pressure monitor (HBPM)-based intervention for the
      early detection of pre-hypertension and prevention of clinical hypertension in survivors of
      childhood cancer. Eligible and consenting participants will be randomized into one of three
      groups:

      GROUP 1: Instructed to measure blood pressure (BP) every day for 3 months. GROUP 2:
      Instructed to measure BP for 7 consecutive days once a month, for 3 months.

      GROUP 3: Instructed to measure blood pressure for 3 consecutive days each month, for 3
      months.

      The randomization to the above groups will be done using sequential assignment of newly
      recruited participants based on a randomly ordered list.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of High Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) for three consecutive
           months using a remote blood pressure device provided to participants of the St. Jude
           Lifetime cohort (SJLIFE) protocol.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess compliance with use of HBPM by measurement frequency, evaluating overall and
           defined minimum use in each of the three different groups.

        -  Assess compliance with use of HBPM by cell phone status, evaluating those with and
           without a personal cell phone capable of connecting directly to the home blood pressure
           monitoring device via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network.

      The proposed research and testing being done during this study includes:

        1. Screening evaluation and consent - Individuals will be asked questions to help the
           investigators determine if they are eligible to participate. This includes questions
           about medical history pertaining to blood pressure, medicines, and certain medical
           conditions, and if the individuals are willing to use the technology provided by the
           study. For individuals who are eligible to participate, an opportunity will be provided
           to discuss the study and complete the consent process.

        2. Group assignment and randomization - Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
           three groups: a study team member will select one of sixty identical envelopes, each
           containing a group assignment, with 20 envelopes containing each of the three group
           assignments. This random group assignment determines the frequency with which
           participants will monitor their blood pressure at home. The randomization between three
           different groups will help investigators determine how often survivors can consistently
           monitor their blood pressure.

        3. Educational session - After participants have been assigned to a group, they will be
           instructed on how to set up and use the home blood pressure monitoring device.

        4. Monitoring blood pressure at home - Participants will be asked to monitor their blood
           pressure at home in the morning and evening using a remote monitoring device over a
           three-month period. Frequency of monitoring depends on the random group assignment. The
           device is the iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor which is a wireless blood pressure
           monitoring device that fits snugly around one arm and automatically measures and records
           blood pressure in about one minute. The device will be paired with the participant's
           smart phone or study-provided iPod Touch, which is then used to operate the device and
           save the blood pressure readings. After completion of the three-month monitoring period,
           participants will be asked to return the device (and iPod Touch, if applicable).

        5. Reminders to use the device - Participants are to start monitoring their blood pressure
           when they return home after completion of their St. Jude visit. During the educational
           session, participants will be asked to set up reminders on their smart phone or
           study-provided iPod Touch to alert them to monitor their blood pressure. Depending on
           how often they are assigned to monitor their blood pressure, they may also receive email
           and/or text reminders to prompt them to monitor their blood pressure. In addition, a
           study team member may contact them if they have three or more measurements above 140/90
           mm Hg, as that reading is considered hypertensive. A study team member may contact
           participants if they are not monitoring as specified by their group assignment to
           attempt to troubleshoot any barriers and/or technical issues.

    <description>Participants will be provided with an iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure (BP) Monitor and instructions for proper use (based on a standard protocol). The iHealth device pairs easily with a cell phone or other mobile device equipped with the iHealth app (freely available on app stores for both Apple and Android devices). Participants place the cuff on their arm and press start on their mobile device. The device measures BP using the oscillometric method and automatically downloads measurements and timing to a cloud-based server.
Participants will be educated that individual BP readings can be highly variable and that any one high or low reading has little or no significance. They will also be encouraged not to measure their blood pressure more than twice in the morning and twice in the evening.</description>
