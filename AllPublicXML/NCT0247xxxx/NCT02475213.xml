    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of enoblituzumab (MGA271) in combination
      with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) when given to patients with B7-H3-expressing melanoma, squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Urothelial
      Cancer and other B7-H3 expressing cancers. The study will also evaluate what is the highest
      dose of enoblituzumab that can be given safely when given with pembrolizumab. Assessments
      will also be done to see how the drug acts in the body (pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity of MGA271 in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, cohort expansion, and efficacy follow-up
      study of enoblituzumab administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule for up to 51
      doses in combination with IV pembrolizumab administered on an every-3-week schedule for up to
      17 doses.

      The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of enoblituzumab and pembrolizumab and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum
      administered dose (MTD/MAD). Patients with methothelioma, urethelial cancer, NSCLC, SCCHN,
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer, triple
      negative breast cancer (TBNC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or
      prostate cancer will be enrolled in this study phase.

      During the Cohort Expansion Phase, additional cohorts of patients with B7-H3 expressing
      unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic melanoma (up to n=16), 2 cohorts of NSCLC (n= up
      to 20 in each cohort), 2 cohorts of SCCHN (up to n=20 in each cohort) or urothelial cancer
      (up to n=16) will be enrolled to receive MGA271 in combination with pembrolizumab at the MTD
      (or MAD) established from the Dose Escalation Phase of the study.

      The efficacy follow-up period consists of the 2-year period after the final dose of study
      drug.

      All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

    <description>Enoblituzumab: Fc-optimized, humanized monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab: Keytruda; human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, or with advanced (metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed after other treatments and with tumors that express a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test, the first test designed to detect PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung tumors.</description>
