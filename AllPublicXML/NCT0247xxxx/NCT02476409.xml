    <textblock>
      Patients who present to clinic or in the outpatient setting with worsening heart failure
      represent a unique opportunity for novel approaches to decongestion (removing fluid) that may
      more rapidly improve fluid status and symptoms as well as reduce the risk of hospitalization.

      In these patients with less severe congestion (fluid overload), combining the vasopressin
      antagonist tolvaptan with loop diuretics (or fluid pills like
      furosemide/bumetanide/torsemide) may represent a more effective strategy for decongestion. In
      addition, looking at patients' copeptin levels may help identify those who are more likely to
      respond to tolvaptan.

      This study will be a randomized, double blind, positive control, multi-center clinical trial
      enrolling patients who present in the outpatient setting with signs and symptoms consistent
      with worsening congestive heart failure. The sample size for the study is 40 patients.
      Candidates for the study will be identified by screening outpatients presenting with
      worsening heart failure.

      Patients who qualify for the study will be enrolled within 24 hours of identification.
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Augmentation of current daily dose of oral loop diuretic + 30 mg of oral Tolvaptan daily

        -  Augmentation of current daily dose of oral loop diuretic + placebo of oral Tolvaptan
           daily

      Patients will initiate study medication in a hospital setting and will be observed for a
      period of time that will depend upon their baseline serum sodium and response to study drug.
      In most cases patients will be observed for 8 hours. Following this observational period,
      patients will leave the hospital setting and the remainder of the study will consist of
      follow-up by outpatient visits or by telephone. All patients will have Day 30 follow up phone
      contact for assessment of vital status, adverse events and morbidity during this period.

      The primary objectives of this study will be to compare the effects of oral tolvaptan plus
      augmented loop diuretic versus augmented loop diuretic on 1) short term changes in body
      weight with and without stratification for baseline copeptin and 2) an index targeted to
      signs and symptoms of congestion in patients presenting with worsening congestive heart
      failure in the outpatient setting with and without prespecified post hoc stratification based
      on baseline copeptin level.
