      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study. After more than 24 weeks NA
      treatment, HBeAg positive CHB patients who achieved HBV DNA&lt;1000copies/ml but HBeAb negative,
      will be randomized (1:1) into 2 study arms as follows:

      Arm A: Peginterferon alfa-2a 180μg /wk plus NA 1 piece qd for 48 weeks Arm B: Entecavir 0.5mg
      qd for 48 weeks

          1. Male and female patients with age ≥18 and ≤65 years;

          2. There should be evidences that HBsAg and HBeAg have been positive for more than 6
             months with HBsAb and HBeAb negative before treated with Entecavir;

          3. Treated with NA for more than 24 weeks and achieve HBV DNA&lt;1000copies/ml with HBeAb
             negative;

          4. Women without ongoing pregnancy or breast feeding and willing to take an effective
             contraceptive measure during the treatment

             to 3 months or any history of the following: a suicidal attempt hospitalization for
             psychiatric disease, or a period of disability due to a psychiatric disease

             idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
             scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis etc.)

         12. History of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV, myocardial
             infarction within 6 months, ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring ongoing treatment,
             unstable angina or other significant cardiovascular diseases)

         13. Hemodialysis patients or patients with renal insufficiency

         14. History of a severe seizure disorder or current anticonvulsant use

         15. Major organ transplantation or other evidence of severe illness, malignancy, or any
             other conditions, which would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator,
             unsuitable for the study

         16. History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications

         17. Evidence of severe retinopathy or clinically relevant ophthalmologic disorder

         18. History of other severe disease or evidence of other severe disease or any other
             illness or conditions that the investigator believe that patients are not suitable to
             join in the study

         19. Immunomodulatory treatment (including interferon) or LDT within 1 year prior to the
             first dose of treatment

         20. Patients included in another trial or having been given investigational drugs within
             12 weeks prior to screening
