      This Phase I/II study is designed to first identify doses of MLN9708 and bendamustine that
      are associated with an acceptable adverse event profile when delivered together in 28-day
      cycles. Additionally, the study aims to assess the efficacy of the combination in patients
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Responders (stable disease or more), will continue
      to receive up to eight cycles total in the absence of further progressive disease.

      OVERVIEW: This Phase I/II study is designed to first identify doses of MLN9708 and
      bendamustine that are associated with an acceptable adverse event profile when delivered
      together in 28-day cycles. Additionally, the study aims to assess the efficacy of the
      combination in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Responders (stable disease
      or more),will continue to receive up to eight cycles total in the absence of further
      progressive disease.

      OVERVIEW OF THE DOSE ESCALATION/DE-ESCALATION THAT WAS USED: This study aims to assess the
      combination's efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Responders
      (stable disease or more),will continue to receive up to eight cycles total in the absence of
      further progressive disease. The dose of MLN9708 will be fixed at 4 mg, days 1, 8 and 15.
      Dexamethasone administered as 40 mg oral on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 day cycle. The dose of
      MLN9708 will be fixed at 4 mg, days 1, 8 and 15. Dexamethasone administered as 40 mg oral on
      Days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 day cycle. Three doses of bendamustine will be evaluated (Dose 1: 70
      mg/m2, days 1 and 2; Dose 2: 80 mg/m2. days 1 and 2; and Dose 3: 90 mg/m2, days 1 and 2).
      NOTE:

      PHASE 1 DESIGN: A 3+3 design was employed. At each dose, three patients were initially
      evaluated. When no dose limiting toxicities were observed, the bendamustine dose was
      increased.

      PHASE 2 DESIGN: Design for Phase II portion of study: The MTD or a recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for the combination (80mg/m2 bendamustine) was identified in 2016, the plan is to
      treat additional patients at that dose to assess efficacy and response to treatment. The
      investigators plan to enroll 19 patients (including those treated at the MTD in Phase I).

             with IXAZOMIB whether treated with IXAZOMIB or not.
