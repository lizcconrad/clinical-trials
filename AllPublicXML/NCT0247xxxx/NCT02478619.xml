  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of preoperative inspiratory muscle training
      in patients with grade III obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. It will be a double-blind
      randomized controlled clinical trial with volunteers allocated in two groups that will be
      compared according to postoperative evolution (pulmonary complications, lung function,
      strength and endurance of the respiratory muscles and respiratory system resistance).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has a significantly increase in recent years and represents a
      public health problem due to the increased risk of mortality from various causes. Changes in
      respiratory system arising from obesity are well established and they include a reduction in
      compliance with an increased ventilatory work and oxygen consumption with breathing.
      Bariatric surgery is an alternative surgical treatment of obesity and patients who undergo
      this surgery are susceptible to post operative pulmonary complications as a result of obesity
      and also abdominal surgery. The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) used in pre or post
      operative period can improve muscle strength and endurance, beyond the perception of
      dyspnea.There are suggestions that the preoperative training may contribute to a best post
      operative evolution in patients, but these benefits are not clearly defined in the
      literature. The objective is to evaluate the effects of preoperative IMT in post operative
      patients undergoing gastroplasty. There will be 40 patients of bariatric surgery group in
      Ribeirão Preto Medical School of both sexes, BMI&gt;40 kg/m2 and with the appropriate inclusion
      criteria.They will be assessed by pulmonary function tests, measurement of strength and
      endurance of respiratory muscles, submaximal exercise tests, dyspnea and quality of life
      scales. All patients will receive standard treatment and will be randomly divided into two
      groups, named control group and training group, who will be trained for 4 weeks
      preoperatively. The patients will be reassessed after 4 weeks of training and on the 15th
      postoperative return day. The evolution data about pulmonary complications will be collected
      from the medical records, notes of the medical staff and physical therapy routine service.

    <description>According to Brooks-Brunn (1997) methodology, pulmonary complications will be considered as: cough/sputum production, abnormal breath sounds, temperature ≥ 38°C, chest radiograph documentation of atelectasis or new infiltrate, physician documentation of atelectasis or pneumonia.</description>

    <description>It has beem used a digital manometer (MVD300, Global Med, São Paulo, Brazil) with graduation ranging from 0 to ± 300 cmH2O and adjusted to a rigid mouthpiece, following the proposed model by Black and Hyatt in 1969.</description>

    <description>To perform this measure, it is been used Jaeger® IOS(Jaeger, Wurzburg, Germany) with daily volume and resistance calibration. Data collection happens in different positions: sitting, supine, right lateral decubitus and left lateral decubitus. The parameters are calculated at frequencies between 5 and 35Hz, and will be analyzed the following parameters in this test: resistance (R), reactance (X), reactance area (AX) and resonant frequency (Fres).</description>

    <description>This test is realized by using KoKo Spirometer according ATS/ERS recommendations. The analyzed parameters in this test are: forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in the First Second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75%.</description>
