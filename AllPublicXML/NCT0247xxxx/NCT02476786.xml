  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple neoadjuvant endocrine trials demonstrate that women with good prognosis tumors can
      be identified. These trials have also demonstrated that there are not adverse effects on
      overall outcome if women are treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for several months
      prior to definitive treatment. A new standard of care needs to be defined for elderly women
      with good prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)+ tumors, since these women may benefit from
      endocrine therapy alone to treat their cancer without compromising local and distant control.
      The investigators hypothesize that endocrine therapy alone provides adequate local and
      systemic control of breast cancer in a subpopulation of women 70 or older with ER+ breast
      cancer and low Ki67 scores.

    <description>Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].
In each RECIST response category Oncotype DX scores will be summarized with mean, standard deviation, minimum, 1st, 2nd (median) and 3rd quartiles, and maximum values. OncotypeDx scores range from 0 to 100, with scores &lt;18 indicating low risk.</description>

    <description>Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy will be given at the discretion of the treating physician as directed by the package insert and could include the following: goserelin, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, or tamoxifen
Frequency of office visits will be decided by the treating physician but must occur no less frequently than every 3 to 6 months for tumor assessment
After 6 months and after 12 months, patients will be assessed; patients who progress will have standard care recommended , and at any point a patient can opt to receive standard care even if she has not progressed on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy
Information on quality of life will be collected at baseline, Year 1, and Year 2 by the FACT-B questionnaire
Archival tissue will be collected and sent to Genomic Health for analysis using the Oncotype DX assay. The Recurrence Score predicts chemotherapy benefit and indicates the 10-year risk of recurrence (will not be used to determine treatment)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed histologically or cytologically confirmed operable invasive breast
             cancer defined as cT1 or T2, N0-1, and M0.

          -  Disease must be ER+ and HER2-.

          -  Ki67 score/proliferative index ≤ 30% or low to intermediate mitotic index

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) by ultrasound or mammogram.

          -  70 years of age or older.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 3

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgery for this cancer

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous which would preclude endocrine
             treatment of their cancer.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to any of the agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness as determined by their treating physician which
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with endocrine therapies. Appropriate studies will be
             undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
