  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult airway management is a crucial point that may influence outcomes of patient in this
      critical situation. Education for this topic is of main importance for resident of
      anesthesiology. Procedural simulation workshop allows participant to use device dedicated to
      difficult airway management. Investigators included this workshop to a state education
      program of anesthesiology resident in second year and compared to their homonym in another
      state where no specific organized workshop is integrated to the education program.

      Difficult airway management is a crucial point that may influence outcome of patient in this
      critical situation. Education for this topic is of main importance for resident of
      anesthesiology. Procedural simulation workshop allows participant to use device dedicated to
      difficult airway management. The investigators included this workshop for smal groups of 6-10
      anesthesiology resident from Rhône Alpes Auvergne french state. Participants were ask to fill
      out a questionnaire about their specific knowledge and experience of several devices usable
      in difficult airway management situation. The workshop was a small briefing as an
      introduction to the workshop and then small workshop of 20-45 min for specific procedural use
      of different devices for difficult airway management : Eischmann guide, LMA, supraglottic
      devices, fiberoptic with spontaneous breathing, cricothyroidotomy, jet ventilation,
      percutaneous tracheotomy... Investigator will compare at 6 month the incidence of use of the
      difficult airway devices between resident from rhone alpes auvergne following the workshop
      and resident from Montpellier that did not follow specific organized workshop.
