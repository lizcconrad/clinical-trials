  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel group
      study of ADS-5102 extended release (ER) capsules, an investigational formulation of
      amantadine, dosed once daily at bedtime for the treatment of walking impairment in MS.
      ADS-5102 is designed to be administered once daily at bed time, ADS-5102 achieves higher
      plasma amantadine concentrations in the early morning, sustained throughout the afternoon,
      and lower concentrations in the evening when patients are sleeping. ADS-5102 is designed to
      deliver its primary treatment effect during the day, and potentially reduce the adverse
      events of immediate-release amantadine when the patient is asleep.
