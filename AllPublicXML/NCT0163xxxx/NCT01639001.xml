  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, Randomized, Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Crizotinib single
      agent versus Chemotherapy Regimens (Pemetrexed/Cisplatin or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) in
      First-Line ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      Patients. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that Crizotinib is superior to
      first-line chemotherapy pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in prolonging
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) in East Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC whose
      tumors harbor a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma
      Kinase) gene locus.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on IRR by Treatment Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred first, assessed up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occured first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date − randomization date +1)/30.44. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Based on IRR</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (assessed up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at 12 Weeks Based on IRR</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRR. The best response of SD can be assigned if SD criteria were met at least once after randomization at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Estimate of the Percentage of Participants Surviving at 1 Year and at 18 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Probability of survival 1 year and 18 month after randomization. The probability of survival at 1 year was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and a 2-sided 95% CI for the log [-log(1-year survival probability)] was calculated using a normal approximation and then back transformed to give a CI for the 1-year survival probability itself. The probability of survival at 18 months was estimated similarly.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DR) Based on IRR</measure>
    <time_frame>From objective response to date of progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred first, assessed up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), as determined by the IRR, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. DR (in weeks) was calculated as (first date of PD or death − first date of CR or PR +1)/7. DR was only calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective tumor response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tumor Response (TTR) Based on IRR</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (assessed up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTR was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) as determined by the IRR. For participants proceeding from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. TTR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with objective tumor response.</description>

    <measure>Agreement Between Central Laboratory ALK FISH and ALK IHC Test Results - Molecular Profiling Evaluable</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, less than or equal to 28 days prior to dosing.</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement between central laboratory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) test results is based on analysis of participants in the Molecular Profiling (MP) evaluable population that have an ALK IHC result and an ALK FISH result of either positive or negative only. This MP evaluable population included participants who screen failed, which their ALK test results were negative based on FISH test. Tumor tissue samples from these screen failure participants were consented and kept. These samples served as a part of negative sample set for evaluation of IHC test and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine ALK fusion events. Participants with FISH results of uninformative and assay not performed and IHC results of valid IHC status not available were excluded from the analysis of agreement between central laboratory ALK FISH and ALK IHC test results.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This phase 3, randomized, open label, multicenter study conducted in 35 centers in 5 countries. A total of 207 actual participants were randomized, 104 in the crizotinib arm and 103 in the chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin) arm. This study was still ongoing at the data cutoff date (30 June 2015).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic non squamous non small cell lung cancer and tumors with measurable disease were enrolled. Participants were to be positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus as determined by an ALK break‑apart FISH test.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Crizotinib</title>
          <description>Crizotinib capsules, 250 mg twice daily (BID), were administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants could continue crizotinib treatment beyond the time of RECIST defined Progressive Disease (PD), as determined by independent radiology review (IRR), at the discretion of the investigator if the participant was perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Standard doses of chemotherapy were administered by intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) was administered over 10 minutes or according to institutional administration timing; cisplatin (75 mg/m2) was administered after adequate hydration beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of the pemetrexed infusion and carboplatin was administered on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle at a dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration time curve [AUC] of 5 or 6 mg*min/mL, beginning approximately 30 minutes after end of pemetrexed infusion.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occured first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date − randomization date +1)/30.44. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at 12 Weeks Based on IRR</title>
        <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRR. The best response of SD can be assigned if SD criteria were met at least once after randomization at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Scores in QLQ-C30 Symptoms as Assessed by the EORTC-QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). The QLQ-C30 Appetite loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Dysponea, Fatigue, Financial difficulties, Insomnia, Nausea/vomiting, and Pain each ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 1 to end of treatment or withdrawal, no later than 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) from last dose of study medication or when the decision was taken to withdraw from the study (whichever was sooner, assessed up to 33 months)</time_frame>

            <description>Crizotinib capsules, 250 mg twice daily (BID), were administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants could continue crizotinib treatment beyond the time of RECIST defined Progressive Disease (PD), as determined by independent radiology review (IRR), at the discretion of the investigator if the participant was perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit.</description>

Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) was administered over 10 minutes or according to institutional administration timing; cisplatin (75 mg/m2) was administered after adequate hydration beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of the pemetrexed infusion and carboplatin was administered on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle at a dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration time curve [AUC] of 5 or 6 mg*min/mL, beginning approximately 30 minutes after end of pemetrexed infusion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Lung Cancer Symptom Scores as Assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ- LC13)</title>
        <description>The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed the specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use of lung cancer participants receiving chemotherapy. The QLQ-LC13 Alopecia, Coughing, Dysphagia, Dyspnoea, Haemoptysis, Pain in arm or shoulder, Pain in chest, Pain in other parts, Peripheral neuropathy, and Sore mouth each ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 1 to end of treatment or withdrawal, no later than 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) from last dose of study medication or when the decision was taken to withdraw from the study (whichever was sooner, assessed up to 33 months)</time_frame>

            <title>Crizotinib</title>
            <description>Crizotinib capsules, 250 mg twice daily (BID), were administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants could continue crizotinib treatment beyond the time of RECIST defined Progressive Disease (PD), as determined by independent radiology review (IRR), at the discretion of the investigator if the participant was perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit.</description>

Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) was administered over 10 minutes or according to institutional administration timing; cisplatin (75 mg/m2) was administered after adequate hydration beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of the pemetrexed infusion and carboplatin was administered on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle at a dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration time curve [AUC] of 5 or 6 mg*min/mL, beginning approximately 30 minutes after end of pemetrexed infusion.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized, participant-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in General Health Status as Assessed by EQ-5D- Index</title>
          <description>EQ-5D is a standardized, participant-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a visual analog scale (VAS). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the 5 dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).</description>

        <title>Agreement Between Central Laboratory ALK FISH and ALK IHC Test Results - Molecular Profiling Evaluable</title>
        <description>Agreement between central laboratory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) test results is based on analysis of participants in the Molecular Profiling (MP) evaluable population that have an ALK IHC result and an ALK FISH result of either positive or negative only. This MP evaluable population included participants who screen failed, which their ALK test results were negative based on FISH test. Tumor tissue samples from these screen failure participants were consented and kept. These samples served as a part of negative sample set for evaluation of IHC test and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine ALK fusion events. Participants with FISH results of uninformative and assay not performed and IHC results of valid IHC status not available were excluded from the analysis of agreement between central laboratory ALK FISH and ALK IHC test results.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs; All Causalities)</title>
        <description>An AE was an untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of study medication. AEs were to be collected from first dose until 28 days after the last dose of study medication. SAEs could be collected after this timeframe if considered to be treatment related. Grade 3 and 4 AEs in below table indicated severe AE and life-threatening consequences respectively; Grade 5 indicated death due to AE. Chemotherapy group in the below table includes data before crossover to crizotinib for participants who crossed over to receive crizotinib.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs (Treatment Related)</title>
          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study treatment in a participant who received study treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs were to be collected from first dose until 28 days after the last dose of study medication. SAEs could be collected after this timeframe if considered to be treatment related. Grade 3 and 4 AEs in the below table indicated severe AE and life-threatening consequences respectively; Grade 5 indicated death related to AE. Chemotherapy group in the below table, only includes data before crossover to crizotinib for those participants who crossed over to receive crizotinib treatment.</description>
