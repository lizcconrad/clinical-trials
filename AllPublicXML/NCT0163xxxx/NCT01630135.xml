    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the 3 Total Nasal Symptom Score (3TNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through the entire treatment period (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 3TNSS is the sum of the 3 individual symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for the 3TNSS is 0 to 9. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the informed consent form (ICF) or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average 3TNSS over the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). For the entire assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean score for the entire treatment period minus the score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the 3 Total Nasal Symptom Score (3TNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The 3TNSS is the sum of the 3 individual symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for the 3TNSS is 0 to 9. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the informed consent form (ICF) or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average 3TNSS over the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). For the entire assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean score for the entire treatment period minus the score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in 3TNSS at Week 1 and Week 2</title>
        <description>The 3TNSS is the sum of the 3 individual symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for the 3TNSS is 0 to 9. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average 3TNSS over the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). For Week 1 and Week 2, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean score at Week 1 and Week 2 minus the score at Baseline.</description>

        <population>FAS. Change from Baseline was analyzed for only those participants who were available for assessment at both Baseline and the indicated assessment period. The analysis was based on ANCOVA with a model adjusting for Treatment, Baseline, Age, and Sex.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the 4 Total Nasal Symptom Score (4TNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period, at Week 1, and at Week 2</title>
        <description>The 4TNSS is the sum of the 4 individual symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for the 4TNSS is 0 to 12. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average of the 4TNSS in the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). A mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period, at Week 1, and at Week 2</title>
        <description>Symptoms of eye itching, tearing, and redness were scored by the participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (a larger score indicates more severe symptoms) and were recorded in the participant's diary. The TOSS is the sum of all three symtpom scores and ranges from 0 to 9. The mean of the Baseline period is defined as the mean score of 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). The mean of each assessment period is defined as the mean score of the entire treatment period (Weeks 1 and 2), Week 1, and Week 2. For each assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Symptoms of eye itching, tearing, and redness were scored by the participant's (par.) parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the par. themself using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (a larger score indicates more severe symptoms) and were recorded in the par.'s diary. The TOSS is the sum of all 3 symptom scores and ranges from 0 to 9. The mean of the BL period is defined as the mean score of 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). The mean of each assessment period is defined as the mean score of the entire treatment period (Weeks 1 and 2), Week 1, and Week 2. For each assessment period, a mean score for each par. was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Percent change from BL=(mean score at post-BL assessment minus score at BL) divided by the BL value * 100.</description>

For each assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>
          <population>FAS. Only those participants who were available for assessment at both Baseline and the indicated assessment period were analyzed. Participants were analyzed for the entire treatment period if they had an assessment on any day during Week 1 and Week 2. The analysis was based on an ANCOVA with a model adjusting for Treatment, Baseline, Age, and Sex.</population>
