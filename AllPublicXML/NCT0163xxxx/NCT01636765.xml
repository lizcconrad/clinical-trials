    <measure>Inter-rater Reliability of the Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-rater agreement (among raters) of the CEA scores (0=clear skin with no signs of erythema; 1=almost clear of erythema, slight redness; 2=mild erythema, definite redness; 3=moderate erythema, marked redness; 4=severe erythema, fiery redness) evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W). Each of 7 raters scored 104 participant's severity of erythema due to rosacea using the CEA Scale at 2 different time points at day 1. The overall inter-rater agreement for Kendall's W for all raters combined was estimated based on the average of the scores from those 2 different time points. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of Kendall's W was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was pre-defined as: ≤ 0=poor, 0.00-0.20=slight, 0.21-0.40=fair, 0.41-0.60=moderate, 0.61-0.80=substantial and 0.81-1.00=almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for Kendall's W was provided.</description>

    <measure>Intra-rater Reliability of the CEA Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-rater (within raters) agreement of the CEA scores (0=clear skin with no signs of erythema; 1=almost clear of erythema, slight redness; 2=mild erythema, definite redness; 3=moderate erythema, marked redness; 4=severe erythema, fiery redness) was evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics (WKS). WKS were calculated for each of 7 raters who evaluated 104 participant's severity of erythema of rosacea using the CEA scale, assessing agreement between 2 different time points at day 1. The overall intra-rater agreement for WKS for all raters combined was estimated by pooling WKS for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of WKS was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was predefined as: ≤ 0=poor, 0.00-0.20=slight, 0.21-0.40=fair, 0.41-0.60=moderate, 0.61-0.80=substantial and 0.81-1.00=almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for Kappa statistics was provided.</description>
