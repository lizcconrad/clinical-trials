      Otherwise healthy infants (1-12 months of age at the diagnosis) with CMA were prospectively
      evaluated. Patients with cow's milk protein-induced anaphylaxis, eosinophilic disorders of
      the gastrointestinal tract, and food protein induced enterocolitic syndrome were excluded. A
      food challenge was performed 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis to assess clinical tolerance
      acquisition. Main demographic and clinical characteristics were collected for each patient.

        We prospectively evaluated otherwise healthy infants (1-12 months of age at the diagnosis)
        visit one the Pediatric Gastroenterology and Allergology Centre because of the necessity of
        a diagnostic oral food challenge for cow's milk proteins. Children were in stable clinical
        condition without signs of CMA already on exclusion diet with an hypoallergenic formula for
        a period of 7-15 days as presented by the general paediatrician, immediately the symptoms
        appear and before being attended at the Center for diagnosis of CMA.
