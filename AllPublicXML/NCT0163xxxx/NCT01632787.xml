  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute exacerbation of chronic headache disorder present frequently to the
      Emergency Department (ED) for pain management. A novel etiology of headaches is Vertical
      Heterophoria (VH), a poorly understood and little recognized binocular vision malady that
      when treated with realigning prismatic spectacle lenses results in marked reduction in
      headache and other associated VH symptoms.

      This study aims to determine the accuracy of the Vertical Heterophoria Symptom Questionnaire
      (VHSQ) in identifying a ED headache patients who will experience significant reduction in VH
      symptoms with use of realigning prismatic spectacle lenses. This study's secondary purpose is
      to determine if VH is a common cause of chronic headache disorders in ED headache patients.

      To achieve these goals, a prospective observational study will be performed on ED headache
      patients &gt; 18 years old. All will be given the VHSQ, and all will be assessed for a diagnosis
      of VH by an optometrist who will utilize a novel VH testing method. High and low score groups
      on the VHSQ will then be compared to each other to determine the prevalence of VH in each.

    <description>A Vertical Heterophoria Symptom Questionnaire (VHSQ) as well as Headache Disability Index (HDI) survey is used on all Emergency Department (ED) headache patients to assess medical history and symptom burden. Prism testing (or Prism Challenge) is performed by the study optometrist to identify those who have Vertical Heterophoria (VH). Prism Challenge is similar to prescription eyeglass testing, but with unique lenses that are meant to reduce strain on eyes that are misaligned. Follow-up questionnaires are then administered to assess any improvement in symptom burden.</description>
