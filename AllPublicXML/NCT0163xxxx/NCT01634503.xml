    <textblock>
      This study is to determine maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of GX 188E by defining the safety
      profile the safety and maximum tolerated dose of GX-188E administered by electroporation in
      Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) patients.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, dose-escalation, single-center, phase I study to evaluate the
      safety of GX-188E, a DNA-based therapeutic vaccine, administered by electroporation (EP) in
      patients with HPV-16 or HPV-18 associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3).

      Each subject eligible to participate in the trial is given a subject number, which is
      assigned sequentially in ascending order, then allocated to only a single dose level of the
      drug. Three subjects are allocated at each dose level starting with 1mg whereby the dose is
      escalated in sequential subjects in ascending numerical order of subject ID.

      Each subject visit the site three times for administration during the study and is given an
      intramuscular injection of GX-188E at a dose of 1mg, 2mg or 4mg by electroporation at each
      visit

      The subjects conduct the follow-up visits twice, which are 8 weeks and 24 weeks after the
      third injection of GX-188E respectively.

    <description>Patients will be assigned to three dose groups:1mg, 2mg, and 4mg. Each patient will be administered GX-188E by electroporation in entire study period. The Maximum Tolerated Dose of GX-188E will be determined by the classical 3+3 dose escalation schedule. The number of patients will be ranged from 9 to 18.</description>
