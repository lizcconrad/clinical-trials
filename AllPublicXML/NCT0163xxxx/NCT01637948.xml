  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been seen as the predominant way of treating disease
      in China over three thousand years. Certain TCM have scientifically proved to have
      anti-bacterial property. Patients having orthodontic treatment have higher risks of caries
      and gum diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of TCM
      Mouthrinses in addition to toothbrushing and flossing has an added benefit for orthodontic
      patients in maintaining proper oral health.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
      mouthrinse on gingival health and microbial profiles in orthodontic patients. This six-month
      randomized, single-blinded, parallel controlled clinical trial consists of 90 patients with
      fixed appliance treatment. The subjects were allocated to (1) negative-control group: oral
      hygiene instruction (OHI) alone; (2) positive-control group: OHI plus an EO mouthrinse
      (Listerine®)(3) test group: OHI plus the TCM mouthrinse (5% Fructus mume extract). Clinical
      examinations included Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding Index (BI) and Modified Gingival Index
      (MGI). Salivary microbial quantifications included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria,
      Streptococci and Lactobacilli counts. Clinical and microbiological examinations were
      conducted at baseline, 3 and 6 months (T1, T2 and T3).
