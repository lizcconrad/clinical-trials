      This is a long term follow-up study of the open label, single-center, phase I clinical trial
      to evaluate the safety of Pneumostem® in premature infants with BPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of death for premature newborns
      with low birth weights. In addition, many children who recover from the disease suffer from
      various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension, and failure
      to thrive.

      It has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can
      differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies
      showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with
      pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the
      findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged
      lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes,
      and so on.

      PNEUMOSTEM® consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is
      intended to treat BPD in premature infants. This is a long term follow-up study of the
      earlier part of the phase I clinical trial.
