      Once the lab test is positive for c. diff, the investigators will order the patient to have
      PEG 3350 solution, one 8oz glass every ten minutes until 6 liters are gone, but if still not
      clear 2 more liters may be ordered. At enrollment, the treatment arm will have an order for
      500 cc Normal saline to be given I.V. The patient will continue with antibiotic treatment as
      well. The investigators will plan to check c. diff tests daily to see when they become
      negative. The investigators will perform chart audit/review to track mortality, the length of
      stay, ICU days, surgical intervention, and APACHE scores (assessment of disease severity).
      Chart audit will be used to collect data on their diet and how they feel using a visual
      analog scale (collected by nursing staff daily as a standard procedure; see attached pain
      scale). Using chart audit, the investigators will record whether the patient is
      immunocompromised or not.

      Project Summary:

      Clostridium Difficile (c. diff) is a bacteria which causes much morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. It does so by causing diarrhea and abdominal pain. It can be mild and
      self-limited, to severe and lethal, even in developed countries. It can require removal of
      the colon to try to spare a victim's life. This isn't always successful. Current treatment is
      withdrawal of any unnecessary antibiotics, addition of one of two antibiotics that work
      pretty reliably against c.diff, hydration, and observation for signs the patient might need
      to be operated.

      The investigators propose that instead of trying to kill the bacteria that are a problem,
      with limited antibiotic choices, the investigators can give the patient a bowel prep and
      quickly and reliably wash the bacteria, and the toxin that actually wreaks the havoc, out of
      their system.

      The investigators will collect variables of mortality, LOS, ICU days, surgical interventions
      (colectomy or ileostomy and lavage), time to test negative after treatment starts, and APACHE
      scores. The investigators will track when regular diet is resumed. The investigators will
      track immunocompromised state and see the effect it has. The investigators will use a visual
      analog scale to assess time to feel better as well.

      Project description:

      Rationale- Clostridium difficile (c. diff) is a bacteria in the gut which has the ability to
      make us very sick by releasing toxins which cause colitis. It has traditionally affected the
      hospitalized and those who have recently had antibiotics. Recently the investigators have
      seen more community acquired cases as well as cases with no antibiotics preceding the
      infection. C. diff can produce self-limited diarrhea and bloating, or become very severe and
      include severe diarrhea, bowel necrosis, toxemia and death. Over the last four years at
      Genesys, death rates with c. diff (all cause mortality rates) have averaged 9.6% of those
      infected. The investigators have averaged over 230 cases per year of c. diff infections.
      Clearly this is a big problem.

      Traditional treatment is IV fluids, one of two antibiotics (vancomycin or flagyl) along with
      bowel rest, and withdrawing any unnecessary broad spectrum antibiotics (Cohen, 2010.) This
      helps most people, but can still progress in some cases. If the disease is or becomes severe
      enough, near total colon resection is required (surgery), but by that point in the disease
      process, 35-80% will die anyway (Neal, 2011.) Those that survive have a lot of morbidity from
      the ileostomy they now have (the hassle of stooling into a bag, and the dehydration that
      frequently accompanies the ileostomy). It's an extremely challenging problem which should be
      feared to worsen if and when it becomes resistant to the very few antibiotics that are
      currently effective. The investigators need to find a better way to treat it.

      Recently out of Pittsburgh, a study was performed in which they took very sick patients to
      the operating room earlier and diverted the stool stream with an ileostomy and flushed
      Go-Lytely (polyethylene glycol) through the colon to clean it out of all the stool, bacteria,
      and toxin (but did not remove the colon), followed by antibiotics through the colon. They
      showed a reduction in the mortality rate after surgery from 50% down to 19% for a reduction
      of 62% (Neal, 2011). The results are very promising, but this process does require two
      operations - one to make the ileostomy and another to reverse the ileostomy later on. It also
      waits until the patients get very sick to clean out the GI tract of the bacteria and toxin.

      A second paper reported two cases of chronic c. diff patients taking a bowel prep of
      Go-Lytely by mouth, and then being 'cured' after 36-48 months and counting (Liacouras, 1996).

      In the investigators study, the investigators will still withdraw any unnecessary
      antibiotics, provide hydration, and treat with the same antibiotic regimen the admitting
      physician has decided on. But the investigators will also add a bowel prep of polyethylene
      glycol 3350 solution (PEG solution), to flush out the stool and bacteria. The investigators
      suspicion is that by giving c. diff patients a bowel prep of PEG solution orally (or
      nasogastric tube if unable to swallow), the investigators can wash out the c. diff bacteria
      and toxin they have already produced, instead of trying to kill the bacteria still in the
      colon. The investigators think the investigators can effectively treat even sick c. diff
      patients without an operation. In fact, the investigators can quite possibly prevent many
      mild cases from progressing to severe cases in the first place, thereby greatly decreasing
      the morbidity and mortality of this scary disease.

      Objective- The investigators primary objective is to show that oral administration of
      polyethylene glycol bowel prep solution decreases mortality in clostridium difficile infected
      patients. Secondary objectives include showing decreased length of hospital stay, decreased
      ICU days, decreased time to test negative for c. diff toxin in the stool, and decreased
      surgical interventions, and better patient perceptions. The investigators will use a visual
      analog scale to track how quickly patients perceive they are better. The investigators will
      also determine if timing of diet resumption or immunocompromised status changes outcomes in
      the study.

      Methodology- The study will be a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Eligible patients
      will be assigned by a computer generated, randomized list to either standard treatment (IV
      fluids and vancomycin or flagyl) or the intervention treatment (IV fluids, vancomycin or
      flagyl, and oral bowel prep).

      Study subject criteria includes: all adults greater than age 18, testing positive for c. diff
      as GRMC inpatients. Testing will be via either DNA amplification assay, or through flexible
      endoscopic diagnosis. The lab or endoscopist will contact Dr. Vance or Dr. Alvarez, and they
      will approach the patient to then consent, enroll, and randomize them.

      There are no sex or ethnic background exclusion criteria, and health status of the patient
      will not alter patient selection. The investigators plan to enroll a total of 400 subjects.

      Exclusion criteria include:

        1. Pregnancy

        2. Less than 18 yrs of age

        3. Mentally handicapped

        4. Those sick enough to require surgery at diagnosis shall not be enrolled, as they should
           be operated at that point.

        5. Patients in whom severe ileus or suspected small bowel obstruction is present.

      Interventions- Nu-Lytely or Go-Lytely (polyethylene glycol 3350), produced by Braintree
      Laboratories, Incorporated, will be administered to the study patients. These two products
      are interchangeable at the investigators institution and work by the same mechanism of action
      as a mechanical bowel prep. They will be dosed at one 8oz glass, orally, every 10 minutes
      until 6 liters are ingested. If they are not having clear bowel movements at that point, then
      2 more liters will be given. If there is difficulty drinking the solution, the investigators
      will offer to place a nasogastric tube to deliver the PEG solution to the GI tract. It is FDA
      approved for bowel cleansing, though not specifically for clearing c.diff. It has a long
      history of effective bowel prepping with good patient safety.

      Because the PEG solution can be dehydrating to a degree, the investigators will plan to give
      a 500 mL IV bolus of saline with the start of the bowel prep to prevent this from being an
      issue. These patients are generally dehydrated from the disease process anyway, and IV fluids
      are generally a good idea. The investigators will monitor the patients' BUN and creatinine,
      blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output and treat additionally for dehydration as
      needed.

      If a patient's electrolytes are significantly abnormal at enrollment, the investigators may
      order an additional chemistry panel that evening to ensure this is not worsening. The
      investigators expect this would already be ordered by the primary physician in most cases,
      even without the PEG solution, in routine patient care.

      To accomplish the investigators secondary objective of time to test negative for c. diff, the
      investigators will also collect stool to test for c. diff daily, starting the day after
      enrollment until negative. This will be the Immuno card c. diff toxins A&amp; B test (available
      from Meridian Bioscience), as the DNA amplification method can yield false positive results
      with bowel preps.

      Observations- The observations made by chart review after discharge will include mortality,
      length of stay, operative interventions, and presenting APACHE scores. Time to test negative
      after treatment starts will be assessed daily, and be based on stool testing results. Diet
      will be at the admitting physicians' discretion based on the patient status, but the
      investigators will monitor to see if it seems to affect successes in treating the c. diff.
      Additionally, the investigators will use a visual analog scale to determine when patients
      feel better. Nurses are required by standing policy to record visual analog pain scale
      responses (scale is attached). The investigators will use these responses for the study.

      Sample size- To show that a mortality reduction of 70% is significant in a population with
      10% mortality, a power analysis determined that 200 in each group is required to achieve 82%
      power detection. A total of 400 subjects will be enrolled into the study.

      Data Management and Analysis- The primary hypothesis of comparing mortality between groups
      will be conducted using Chi square analysis. The secondary hypothesis of comparing mean days
      to negative test for c. diff toxin, will be analyzed using the Independent Students' t-Test
      for means (Mann Whitney-U test for comparing median number of days). Hospital and ICU LOS
      will be compared using Students' t-Test and patient perceived improvement will be compared
      using the Mann Whitney-U test. Surgical intervention rate will be compared by group with
      Chi-square analysis.

      Ethical Considerations:

      The study is ethical based on the possibility of a more effective way to treat a difficult
      disease, and the possibility of decreasing the patients' own mortality and rate of surgical
      interventions. The possible nausea, dehydration, abdominal bloating and discomfort will be
      treated symptomatically, and the rewards potentially much outweigh the risks.

      Persons with mental disabilities will be excluded. If the study is a success, this may
      dramatically reduce mortality at Genesys and elsewhere. The Centers for Disease Control
      estimates that over 14,000 patients die in the USA annually from c.diff infection induced
      diarrhea. The investigators couldn't locate worldwide numbers, but clearly significant, and a
      reduction in those deaths through an effective, widely available, inexpensive treatment
      should be welcome everywhere.

      Informed decision-making:

      Study eligible patients will be approached by the study physicians. The study will be
      explained to the patient and their family when present. The consent form will be provided to
      the patient and they will be given time to ask questions and read over the consent form. The
      investigators informed consent form is attached. Patients who agree will be enrolled into the
      study by the study physicians.

      Gender Issues:

      The investigators plan to include women and men alike in the study. When the investigators
      analyze the data, the investigators will determine any significant differences in outcomes
      based on gender, and report these.
