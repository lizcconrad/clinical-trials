    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, split-face, prospective study of ten to fifteen subjects
      seeking vascular laser therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate rosacea. Subjects will
      be screened for eligibility for vascular laser therapy outside of the confines of this
      protocol. Once approved for laser, subjects will be screened for study enrollment and topical
      treatment of their rosacea at the Screening/Baseline visit. All subjects will receive Finacea
      15% gel and will be instructed to apply the study drug to one half of the face, twice daily.
      Drug application will be modified just prior to and after the subjects' laser treatment to
      reduce irritation. Subjects will undergo Vascular Nd:Yag laser therapy to involved areas over
      the whole face two weeks after initiating Finacea treatment. Subjects will continue to use
      Finacea gel to one half of the face for the duration of the study.

      lesions, redness, and telangiectasias will be performed at Screening/Baseline, Week 2 (prior
      to laser treatment), and week 6/End of Study. Photography will be performed at
      Screening/Baseline and End of Study visits. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit,
      and a patient survey will be completed at Baseline and at Week 6/End of Study visits.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject with mild to moderate rosacea, age 18 and over, who agrees to
             participate and provide written consent.

          -  Have an Investigator Global Assessment of mild to moderate rosacea (IGA rating between
             2 and 5 in the Investigator Global Assessment (Appendix B) and at least a &quot;Mild&quot;
             rating on the Telangiectasia Rating Scale

          -  Subjects must be eligible to undergo vascular laser therapy and have been previously
             approved for therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Initiation or change in dose within 4 weeks of baseline of systemic anti‐inflammatory
             medication which may influence study outcome.

          -  Use of topical therapy for rosacea within 2 weeks of baseline.

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks of baseline.

          -  Use of systemic retinoids within 6 months of baseline

          -  Presence of a concurrent medical condition or skin condition, which is determined by
             the investigator to potentially interfere with study outcomes or patient assessments.

          -  Amount of disease involvement that would require &gt;60 gm of cream in a 6 week period.

          -  Subjects with known allergy or sensitivity to azelaic acid (Finacea®) gel or
             components therein, such as propylene glycol.

          -  Contraindication to vascular laser therapy, such as infections.

          -  Female subjects who are not postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or
             willing to practice effective contraception during the study. Reliable methods of
             birth control are: abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed
             negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable,
             although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal
             foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or sponge. Nursing mothers, pregnant women and women
             planning to become pregnant while on study are to be excluded.
