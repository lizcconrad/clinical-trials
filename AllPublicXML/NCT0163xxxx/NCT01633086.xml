    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover, 12-week trial to
      be conducted in 50 subjects with painful diabetic neuropathy. The objective of this trial is
      to assess the safety and efficacy of NO gel, a NO donor, as compared with a placebo gel, in
      symptom relief of subjects with painful diabetic neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a common symptom of diabetic neuropathy, and predominantly involves the
      lower limbs. Current strategies for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy include
      improved glycemic control, use of analgesics and addition of tricyclic antidepressants and
      anticonvulsants. However, many patients experience unsatisfactory responses and some
      undesired side effects. Considerable evidence implicates impaired nitric oxide synthesis
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathic pain. Several small
      studies have shown that topical nitroglycerin ointment has local vasodilating properties, and
      a previous study has demonstrated that isosorbide dinitrate in spray form as a nitric oxide
      donor relieved some neuropathic symptoms in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Based
      on the findings, the investigators hypothesize that nitric oxide gel could be used as an
      alternative pain-relieving agent for patients with resistant diabetic neuropathic pain.

          2. Subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus with painful diabetic neuropathy.

          3. Subjects without undergoing treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy or with
             treatment for at least 3 months but still presenting neuropathic pain prior to
             randomization.

          4. Subjects who are healthy without any serious diseases that require hospitalization
             during the study period.

          5. Subjects who are capable of understanding and having signed the Informed Consent Form
             after detailed description of the treatment procedures and potential risks and
             benefits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with diagnosis of cancer and are still on active therapies.

          2. Subjects with diagnosis of an active disease (e.g. hyper-or-hypothyroidism, advanced
