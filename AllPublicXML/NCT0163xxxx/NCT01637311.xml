  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder, which is characterized clinically by
      symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, weight loss and chest pain. With respect to long-term
      efficacy, Heller myotomy (HM) using an open or a laparoscopic approach has gained wide
      acceptance as the procedure of choice for the management of patients with primary achalasia
      in recent years. Although good or excellent long-term symptomatic response rates can be
      achieved in more than 90% of patients undergoing HM, recurrence or persistence of symptoms
      occurs in approximately 20%. Controversy exists regarding the therapy of patients with failed
      success after HM. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has recently been described as a new
      minimally invasive endoscopic myotomy technique intending a permanent cure from primary
      achalasia. Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of POEM for patients
      with failed HM.

      1. Patients were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were age greater than 18
           years and had recurrence/persistence of symptoms after primary HM with an Eckardt
           symptom score ≥ 4. The diagnosis of achalasia was made on the basis of the absence of
           peristalsis and on impaired relaxation of the LES on established methods (barium
           swallow, manometry, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)). Exclusion criteria were severe
           cardiopulmonary disease or other serious disease leading to unacceptable surgical risk,
           pseudoachalasia, and megaesophagus (diameter of &gt; 7 cm).

        2. All patients were scheduled for a follow-up visit at 1 month after POEM for EGD and
           manometry. Symptoms were assessed 1 month after treatment in the clinic and every 3
           months thereafter via telephone questionnaires.

        3. The primary outcome of the study was therapeutic success (a reduction in the Eckardt
           score to ≤3) at the follow-up assessment. The secondary outcomes included
           procedure-related adverse events, LES pressure on manometry pre- and post POEM, reflux
           symptoms and medication use before and after POEM, and procedure-related parameters such
           as procedure time, hospital stay, and myotomy length.
