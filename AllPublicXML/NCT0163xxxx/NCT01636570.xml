  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with vitamin D3 of 10,000
      International Units (IU) daily in vitamin D deficient patients for 6 months will improve B
      type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a marker of heart function, compared to placebo. The
      investigators also aim to determine if vitamin D helps cardiopulmonary function as evaluated
      by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX), laboratory values, strength, and quality of life in
      patients with stable congestive heart failure (Class II or III).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>B type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in BNP will be measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with vitamin D or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>BNP is a hormone secreted by the heart ventricles, and high concentrations of this hormone occur in heart failure. It is a strong prognostic indicator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in CPX will be measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with Vitamin D3 or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measure will include improvements from baseline in cardiopulmonary function as evaluated by CPX(includes measurement of the change in ventilator efficiency (VE/VCO2), partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>25 hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH)D]</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in 25 hydroxyvitamin D will be measured at baseline, at 12 weeks, and after 6 months of treatment with vitamin D or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with vitamin D deficiency as defined by 25(OH)D of less than 32 ng/ml. 25(OH)D is the most accurate measurement for assessment of vitamin D status. However, ideal ranges for serum 25 (OH)D have not been well established. A recent pharmokinetic study conducted by Hollis, et al, found that 25 OHD levels had to exceed 40 ng/ml and sometimes 50 ng/ml, for the parent substrate (cholecalciferol) to be detectable in the blood (Hollis 2007. IF 25(OH)D levels exceed 150 ng/ml, they will be withdrawn from the study to avoid toxicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>C reactive protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in CRP will be measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with vitamin D or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>CRP is related to heart failure incidence, and vitamin D seems to be inversely related to CRP levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Calcium</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in serum calcium levels will be measured at baseline, at 12 weeks, and at 6 months of treatment with vitamin D or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of serum calcium levels will help to assess safety of vitamin D treatment. If serum calcium becomes elevated, patients will be withdrawn from the clinical trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the 6 minute walk test will be measured at baseline and at 6 months of treatment with vitamin D or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 minute walk test is used to measure aerobic activity at baseline and after completion of supplemental vitamin D or placebo. This test is an objective measurement of exercise capacity, and has been shown to be reproducible and a suitable measure for outcome in patients with heart failure (Guyatt). The 6 minute walk test in heart failure patients is strongly associated with vitamin D serum concentrations (p=0.002) and inversely with high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), an inflammatory marker (p=0.001)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Chang in the KCCQ will be measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with vitamin D or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of quality of life provide means of measuring prospective benefits of heart failure interventions. The KCCQ is associated with hospitalization and mortality, and is sensitive to changes in heart function with ARB, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor treatment.</description>
