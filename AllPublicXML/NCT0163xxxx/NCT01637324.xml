      Objectives

        1. To determine the impact of MSM-targeted multidisciplinary services on uptake of HIV
           voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)

        2. To determine the impact of MSM-targeted multidisciplinary services on the enrollment
           into care and retention of HIV-positive MSM

      Subject population: HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM clients, age â‰¥18 years old, of the Thai
      Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRC-AC) in Bangkok Thailand, the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in
      Jakarta, and the Sanglah Hospital in Bali, Indonesia

      Number of participants: 200 HIV-negative and 150 HIV-positive MSM participants

      This is a prospective cohort study which will recruit 350 MSM clients within 3 months, and
      follow them for 12 months. MSM to be recruited will be first-time clients who come to the
      clinics for services other than VCT. These services may include but would not be limited to
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis and treatment, anal dysplasia screening,
      nutritional counseling and non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP).

      Approximately 250 MSM clients with unknown or previously negative HIV status will be offered
      HIV testing every 3 months (HIV-negative MSM cohort). MSM from the HIV-negative cohort who
      tested HIV-positive during the study (estimated 20%, 50 MSM) will be referred to the
      HIV-positive MSM cohort and will be followed up every 6 months. Additional clients who visit
      the clinic during the 3-month recruitment period with previously known HIV-positive status
      but have not been linked to HIV care (up to 100) will also be enrolled into HIV-positive MSM
      cohort. Therefore, there will be up to 150 HIV-positive subjects enrolled in this study. Each
      enrolled participant will have 12 months in the study.

      This study will allow us to assess VCT and linkage into care, as well as HIV risk behavior
      and need for nPEP, and the incidence or prevalence of important morbidities in MSM such as
      STIs, anal dysplasia/cancer, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
