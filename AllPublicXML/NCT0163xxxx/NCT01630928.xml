  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Re-Shape CV-Risk Study is a clinical study where renal adrenergic denervation (RDN) is
      done in high risk patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. RDN is a mini-invasive,
      percutaneous technique where an ablation catheter is inserted through a femoral artery into
      the renal arteries, for destruction of the adrenergic nerve bundles in the artery adventitia
      by means of radio-frequency ablation. RDN leads to sympathetic denervation of the kidneys,
      which in the &quot;Symplicity trials&quot; led to an impressive reduction of blood pressure (- 33 /-11
      mmHg). In a pilot study, where 40 % of the patients had diabetes, RDN seemed to have
      beneficial effects not only on blood pressure, but also on insulin sensitivity and
      hyperinsulinaemia.

      The investigators aim to introduce RDN as a clinical study where blood pressure reduction and
      methodical, technical aspects will be evaluated, but more importantly, also additional
      effects of RDN on sub-clinical organ damage (endothelial function, vascular stiffness,
      fundus-, heart-, kidney injury), quality of life, arrhythmia, and glucose metabolism. The
      investigators hypothesis is that RDN will have positive effect on glucose metabolism, QOL and
      sub-clinical organ damage.

    <description>This is a mini-invasive trans-catheter procedure with access via a 6F introducer in one of the femoral arteries. The renal sympathetic nerves arise from T10-L2, arborize around the renal artery and primarily lie within the adventitia. A specialized radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter is introduced into the renal arteries, first one side, then on the other. Usually, 4-6 two-minute treatments per artery using a proprietary RF generator with automated low power and built-in safety algorithms are sufficient to ablate the sympathetic afferent and efferent fibers.</description>
