      Background:

      - Gastrointestinal diseases and disorders affect the throat, stomach, and intestines. There
      are many different kinds of these diseases. Clinical trials are being developed to study new
      ways to treat them. People who are interested in clinical trials need to be screened before
      they can take part in the studies. Researchers want to evaluate people with different stomach
      and intestine disorders to see if they are eligible for clinical trials.

      Objectives:

      - To study people who have gastrointestinal disorders and see if they are eligible for
      clinical trials.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have or may have a gastrointestinal disorder.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood, urine,
           and stool samples will be collected. Imaging studies such as x-rays and ultrasound will
           check to see if the disorder has affected other organs.

        -  Participants may have tests as needed depending on their disorder. These tests include
           the following:

        -  Colonoscopy and endoscopy of the large intestine, esophagus, and stomach.

        -  Stomach acid analysis to look at stomach pH levels.

        -  Wireless capsule endoscopy to take pictures of the small intestine.

        -  Hydrogen breath testing to study issues like bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.

        -  Sitz Marker Study to see how fast stool moves through the colon.

        -  Participants may donate extra blood, urine, or stool samples for study. They may also
           donate stomach contents or tissue from the gut.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study. However, participants may be
           admitted to other clinical trials.

      Patients with suspected or established acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases are
      evaluated and treated in this protocol and will be screened for entry into other research
      protocols. This protocol serves several purposes: 1) allows for detailed inquiry into the
      gastrointestinal disorders of these patients and the status of other organ systems that would
      determine their ability to safely enroll in active Digestive Diseases Branch (DDB) research
      protocols; 2) allows investigators to offer clinical diagnostic testing, procedures, and
      treatment to patients if clinically indicated to facilitate their participation in clinical
      trials; 3) allows outpatient evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of
      gastrointestinal diseases for the purposes of physician education in our accredited
      gastroenterology training program; and 4) After completion of the initial evaluation process,
      patients will either be offered a chance to participate in an active research protocol or, if
      no appropriate protocol is identified, patients may be seen long-term to follow the disease
      progression for potential future participation in DDB gastrointestinal studies.
      Recommendations for other treatment options outside of the NIH will be discussed with study
      patients and/or to their primary or referring physicians.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Known or suspected gastrointestinal disorders.

          -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age capable of providing informed
             consent.

             of the NIH.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Significant medical illnesses that the investigators feel may interfere with potential
             evaluations.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, or social conditions which, in the opinion of the
             investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in the best interest of
             the patient.
