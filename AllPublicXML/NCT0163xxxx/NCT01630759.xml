  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When women with diabetes become pregnant it is particularly important to control blood sugar
      levels to prevent complications. Women are advised to test their blood glucose levels seven
      times a day and to attend antenatal and diabetes clinics every 1-2 weeks throughout the
      pregnancy. For those living in rural areas in the North and West of Ireland getting to a
      hospital specialising in the management of diabetes and pregnancy on such a regular basis can
      be a challenge.

      Telemonitoring provides a possible solution to this problem by allowing patients to monitor
      their vital signs at home and transmit the information via telephone to their healthcare
      provider. If women could be safely monitored remotely for every other appointment it would
      mean that they would only need to visit the hospital once a month on a routine basis but with
      the option of attending the hospital if the remote telemonitoring indicated that this were
      necessary.

      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the acceptability of using remote
      telemonitoring facilities between antenatal women with gestational diabetes and the diabetes
      team and the possibility of replacing alternate diabetic review clinics with remote
      telemonitoring. In addition this study will explore the feasibility of running a full
      randomised control trial of this topic.

      Women will be asked to monitor their blood sugar levels seven times a day which is part of
      usual care. However those in the remote telemonitoring group will be asked to measure their
      blood sugar using a meter that can transmit the results via a telephone line and to transmit
      them weekly. They will also be asked to measure their blood pressure and weight weekly and to
      download these results weekly for a health care professional to review. These results will be
      reviewed on a weekly basis by a health care professional who will contact the patient if
      necessary to discuss the results. Women will be followed-up from the date of diagnosis
      through to delivery.

      Both staff and patients will be asked to give their views on the safety and acceptability of
      remote telemonitoring through questionnaires, focus groups or interviews. The management
      decisions made on reviewing the intervention group in clinic and reviewing remote
      telemonitoring results will also be recorded. In order for remote telemonitoring to be a
      viable replacement for clinic review it must allow health care professionals to make
      comparable management decisions. Clinical data will be collected in order to provide
      descriptive statistics for those who take part and to ensure that this information could be
      collected in any future Randomised Control Trial (RCT) looking at this topic.

    <description>The previously validated 'Telemedicine satisfaction and usefulness questionnaire' will be used to assess patient satisfaction with the telemonitoring service.
Qualitative interviews exploring the patient experience of telemonitoring will also be carried out and then analysed using the framework approach. An adapted version of this questionnaire looking specifically at the use of a blood glucose meter will be given to the control group.</description>

    <description>The professionals involved in caring for the women using remote telemonitoring technology in antenatal or diabetes clinics will be invited to take part in a focus group at each site. If it is not possible to arrange a time and place suitable for staff in order to hold a focus group it may be necessary to hold one to one structured interviews with staff. The questions used in the focus group will aim to assess the acceptability of telemonitoring to health care staff who use it.</description>

    <description>Weighted kappa will be used to meaure the level of agreement in between clinic and telemonitoring review management decisions (in excess of the amount of agreement that we would expected by chance). This will allow the determination of inter-rater, intra-rater and inter-institutional agreement between clinic and telemonitoring review management decisions.</description>
