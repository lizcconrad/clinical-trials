  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor mental health problems, MMHP, like mild depression and anxiety, and medically
      unexplained symptoms, MUS, symptoms with no known underlying organic disease, are strongly
      associated to each other. MMHP and MUS have an impact on well-being and quality of life, lead
      to impaired social and cognitive function and could result in reduced work capacity. The
      investigators have designed the present study as a pragmatic trial to investigate the
      effectiveness of an integrative treatment model, therapeutic acupuncture, versus conventional
      treatment in patients with MMHP or MUS in primary care. The investigators examined whether
      the effects of the integrative treatment model differed from those achieved with therapeutic
      acupuncture or conventional treatment. Primary endpoints were anxiety and depression
      (assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), health-related quality of life
      (SF-36) and coping with stress, sense of coherence (SOC) during the eight weeks of treatment
      interventions.

      Statistical power was calculated based on an expected 50% reduction in HAD anxiety and
      depression scores after eight weeks of integrative treatment; a 30% reduction in acupuncture;
      and 20% in conventional care. A total of 120 (40/arm) were needed to achieve a power of 83%
      at p &lt;0.05. Treatment effects were calculated as the difference between values at baseline,
      after four weeks and after the complete intervention period, i.e. after eight weeks.
      Nonparametric analyses were carried out to test differences between independent samples
      (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U) and related samples (Wilcoxon).
