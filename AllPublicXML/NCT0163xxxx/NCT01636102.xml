      To evaluate the safety of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of trivalent nonadjuvated
      influenza study vaccine, formulation 2012/2013, in adult and elderly subjects and the
      antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen, as measured by single radial hemolysis
      (SRH) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) at approximately 21 days postimmunization in adult
      and elderly subjects in compliance with the requirements of the current EU recommendations
      for clinical trials related to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Seroconversion or Significant Increase in SRH Area Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIV</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in single radial hemolysis (SRH) area, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using SRH assay.
Seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area was defined as the percentage of subjects with a negative prevaccination serum (SRH area ≤4 mm2) to a postvaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2; or a significant increase in antibody titer from a non-negative prevaccination serum, i.e., at least a 50% increase in area. The European (CHMP) criterion is met if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area is &gt;40% (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or 30% (≥61 years).</description>

    <measure>Geometric Mean Ratio of Subjects Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIV</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of subjects was calculated as the ratio of postvaccination to prevaccination SRH geometric mean areas (GMAs), directed against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22).
The CHMP criterion was met if the geometric mean increase (GMR, day 22/day 1) in SRH antibody area is &gt;2.5 (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or &gt;2.0 (≥61 years).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved SRH Area ≥25 mm2 Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIV</measure>

    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects achieving SRH area ≥25 mm2 against each of three vaccine strains at baseline (day 1) and three weeks after TIV vaccination (day 22).
This criterion was met according to CHMP guideline if percentage of subjects achieving SRH area ≥25 mm2 is &gt;70% (≥18 years to ≤60) or 60% (≥61 years).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Seroconversion or Significant Increase in SRH Area Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIV</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in single radial hemolysis (SRH) area, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using SRH assay.
Seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area was defined as the percentage of subjects with a negative prevaccination serum (SRH area ≤4 mm2) to a postvaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2; or a significant increase in antibody titer from a non-negative prevaccination serum, i.e., at least a 50% increase in area. The European (CHMP) criterion is met if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area is &gt;40% (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or 30% (≥61 years).</description>
        <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was done on the per-protocol (PP) set, i.e. the subjects who received the vaccine correctly; provided evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points; and had no major protocol violations as defined prior to analysis.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Seroconversion or Significant Increase in SRH Area Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIV</title>
          <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in single radial hemolysis (SRH) area, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using SRH assay.
Seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area was defined as the percentage of subjects with a negative prevaccination serum (SRH area ≤4 mm2) to a postvaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2; or a significant increase in antibody titer from a non-negative prevaccination serum, i.e., at least a 50% increase in area. The European (CHMP) criterion is met if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in SRH area is &gt;40% (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or 30% (≥61 years).</description>
          <population>Analysis was done on the per-protocol (PP) set, i.e. the subjects who received the vaccine correctly; provided evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points; and had no major protocol violations as defined prior to analysis.</population>
