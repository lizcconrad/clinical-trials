  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is a common complaint among patients with atopic dermatitis(AD). Melatonin
      may aid sleep and also has anti-inflammatory properties, and has been suggested in managing
      sleep disturbance in AD patients. However, there has been no large randomized controlled
      trials. Hence the objective of this double-blind randomized controlled study is to determine
      whether supplementing melatonin is effective in improving sleep problems in children with AD.
