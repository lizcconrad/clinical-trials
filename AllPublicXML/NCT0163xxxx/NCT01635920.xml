      The purpose of this study was to compare the overall fit of AIR OPTIX® COLORS to AIR OPTIX®
      AQUA contact lenses.

    <textblock>
      Eligible participants were randomized at Visit 1 (Screening) to receive 1 of the 2
      investigational products (1:1 assignment). Between Visit 1 and Visit 2, participants wore
      their habitual AIR OPTIX® AQUA lenses. Investigational products were dispensed at Visit 2
      (Baseline), after which participants were asked to return for 2 additional visits: Visit 3
      (Day 14) and Visit 4 (Day 28).

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Same Fit in Both Eyes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Lens fit was assessed by the investigator for each eye using a biomicroscope (slit lamp), which magnifies the appearance of the contact lens on the participant's eye. Lens fit was graded on a 5-point scale, with 2=unacceptably loose, 1=acceptably loose, 0=optimal, -1=acceptably tight, and -2=unacceptably tight. &quot;Same fit&quot; was defined as an eye that achieved an acceptable or optimal overall lens fit with the study lens, that was also within one grade of the value observed on the same eye with the habitual lens at the baseline visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Visual acuity of at least 20/30 (Snellen) in each eye at distance with contact lenses
             and best corrected visual acuity ≥ 20/25 in each eye.

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 0.75 diopter (D) (within the previous year) in
             each eye.

          -  Successful wear of AIR OPTIX® AQUA soft contact lenses in both eyes during the past 3
             months for a minimum of 5 days per week and 8 hours per day.

          -  Willing to sign an Informed Consent form. If under legal age of consent, legally
             authorized representative must also sign an Informed Consent form.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude safe administration of the test articles or affect the results of this study.

          -  Wears habitual lenses in an extended wear modality (sleeping in lenses overnight / not
             removing lenses on a daily basis).

          -  Monovision, monocular (only one eye with functional vision), or fit with only one
             lens.

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the test articles.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed topical ocular medications within
             previous 7 days (excluding rewetting drops).

          -  Moderate or severe corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining,
             injection, tarsal abnormalities, &quot;other&quot; complications, and any corneal infiltrates.

          -  Current or history of ocular infection, severe inflammation, or disease within
             previous 6 months.

          -  Any systemic disease that may affect the eye or be exacerbated by use of contact
             lenses or contact lens solutions.

          -  Ocular or intra-ocular surgery within the previous 12 months (excluding placement of
             punctal plugs).

          -  Use of medications contributing to dry eye or ocular irritation unless on a stable
             dosing regimen for a minimum of 30 days prior to study entry and able to remain on
             stable regimen throughout the study.

          -  Participation in any investigational clinical study within previous 30 days.

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
