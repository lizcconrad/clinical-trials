      The purpose of the study is to identify the inflammatory and coagulation pathways and
      mechanisms that are activated immediately following burn injury, and how they affect outcomes
      in terms of organ failure and death. This study also addresses the limitation of current
      tests (PT, PTT, and platelet counts) employed to identify coagulation disturbances in
      severely injured patients both in a comprehensive and rapid manner.
