    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tapentadol Extended Release (ER) in the treatment of
      moderate to severe chronic pain in participants with a diagnosis of chronic low back pain
      (LBP) or osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee after conversion from hydrocodone, oxycodone
      Controlled Release (CR), and/or morphine Sustained Release (SR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single group, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) treatment study to describe the overall clinical experience in participants
      with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or OA pain of the hip or knee, after conversion
      from hydrocodone, oxycodone CR, and/or morphine SR, using dose-conversion ratios of 1:5, 1:5
      and 1:2.5, respectively.

      Approximately 150 participants taking hydrocodone, oxycodone CR, and/or morphine SR with
      baseline pain intensity ≥4 (ie, pain intensity scores averaged over the last 4 days of the
      screening period on an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) will be converted to an initial
      dose of tapentadol ER 100, 150 or 200 mg approximately every 12 hours based on their total
      daily dose of prior opioids. Enrollment of participants in any prior opioid group
      (hydrocodone, oxycodone CR, and/or morphine SR) may be stopped at any time during the study
      to ensure adequate representation of each prior opioid.

      The study will consist of two periods: screening (1 Week) and treatment (4 weeks). The
      expected duration of participation for individual participants is approximately 5 weeks,
      including 4 weeks of active study treatment. The study will include scheduled visits and may
      also include unscheduled phone calls and site visits for dose adjustment and/or for safety
      evaluations.

    <measure>Change in pain intensity from baseline to end of study as measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity NRS is a commonly used pain scale that is a core recommended outcome measure for chronic pain studies. A score of 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; Change in pain intensity is measured from baseline to the end of treatment.</description>

    <description>The pain intensity NRS is a commonly used pain scale that is a core recommended outcome measure for chronic pain studies. A score of 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Quality of life as measured by the SF-12v2® Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12v2® is a 12-item health survey instrument that is used to evaluate the subject's physical, social, and mental well-being. Results are expressed in terms of 2 composite scores: the Physical Component Scale (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). PCS and MCS values can range from 0 to 100. Lowest scores mean very much below and highest scores mean very much above the general population average.</description>

    <measure>Pain interference as measured by the Brief Pain Intensity-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a self-administered, validated tool for the assessment of severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions, location of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief in the last week. The BPI-SF uses a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10, lower score denotes less severity and impact, higher score denotes more severity and impact.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality as measured by the Sleep Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item Sleep Questionnaire is a validated instrument including the 4 main concepts that are considered standard and are consistently measured via sleep diaries: latency, time slept, number of awakenings, and quality experienced by the subject during the preceding night.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extent of neuropathic pain as measured by the painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ is a simple evaluation tool to help identify the presence of neuropathic pain. It consists of 12 questions that ask about the intensity and quality of the patient's pain. A score between 0 and 12 is &quot;negative&quot; (no neuropathic pain component). A score between 19 and 38 is &quot;positive&quot; (presence of neuropathic component)&quot;. Scores from 13 to 18 are &quot;unclear&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant rating of overall treatment status as measured by the patient global impression of change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a questionnaire that assesses the subject's global improvement since starting study treatment. It uses a 7-point NRS (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse).</description>
