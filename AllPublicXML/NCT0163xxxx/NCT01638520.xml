  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New approaches are needed to achieve more rapid elimination of dormant mycobacteria and
      thereby shorten treatment for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Dormant
      mycobacteria are relatively resistant to antibacterial drugs and approaches that enhance
      immune clearance have the potential to be more effective. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a key
      cytokine in the immune response to TB that may impair the clearance of mycobacteria. We
      hypothesize that pascolizumab, an anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody, might be of value as an
      adjunct to standard treatment.

      The aims of this trial are to determine whether administration of pascolizumab as an adjunct
      to standard combination treatment for drug-sensitive TB produces changes in one or more
      parameters of bacterial or host response (including bacterial clearance, host clinical
      status, immune response, bacterial and host transcriptomics, lung imaging) that may indicate
      potential for enhanced sterilization and to confirm the safety of blocking IL-4 (previously
      demonstrated in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma) in patients with TB.
