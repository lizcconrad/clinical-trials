    <description>Standard care includes routine assessment of smoking behavior and brief clinical intervention. Smoking counseling for all participants in the current study will be completed by a Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist consisting consists of brief counseling (&lt;15 minutes) based on the 5 A's Clinical Practice Guidelines; Ask about tobacco use, Advise to quit, Assess willingness to make a quit attempt, Assist in quit attempt, Arrange for follow-up (Fiore et al., 2008). Patients receive information for local and state smoking resources (e.g., Quitline), pharmacotherapy options, and if interested, assistance with obtaining a prescription for pharmacotherapy. Follow-up with patients occurs at 2-weeks, only among those who are prescribed smoking medications (i.e., Varenicline, Bupropion).</description>

    <description>The proposed multimodal intervention consists of a series of easy-to-read relapse prevention booklets (Forever Free) that have shown to be efficacious with a general smoking population (Brandon et al., 2000; 2004), and digital video disk (DVD) customized to the needs of cancer patients (to be developed in Year One).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least one year prior to cancer
             diagnosis

          -  Able to read and write English

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  Have quit smoking after receiving their cancer diagnosis

          -  Have not quit greater than 3 months prior

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have been abstinent for greater than 3 months are not included because
             they are less likely to relapse. A quit will be defined as self-reported no smoking
             for 24 hours. Individuals with metastatic disease will be excluded because
             participation in the study might be burdensome.
