    <textblock>
      This research is being carried out in order to compare two alternative versions of the
      Neurotech Vital Devices which have been set up to provide two different types of stimulation.
      Both these devices will be fully functioning devices and the investigators want to collect
      information on your perception of the two alternative modes. The patient will be asked to
      provide feedback on both devices which will look identical. The patient will not be told in
      which order the units were given to them until the completion of your visit.

    <textblock>
      The Neurotech Vital Device is connected to a series of conductive hydrogel electrodes
      strategically positioned in and around the pelvic area of the user. The electrode positions
      and current pathways deliver therapeutic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles resulting in
      repeated contraction of the intended muscle group. Pilot study data has shown this novel
      approach to produce extremely favorable adaptation and improvement in patient's symptoms
      following intervention. In order to capture the intended electrode position a stand-alone
      garment that will allow the end user to re-position electrodes on multiple re-applications is
      required. The Neurotech Vital Device garment is CE Marked as a Class IIa medical device and
      it is CE Marked, as part of the Neurotech Vital Device, in line with Medical Device Directive
      93/42/EC as amended by 2007/47/EC. The Neurotech Vital Device garment is not cleared by the
      FDA through the 510 (k) pre-market notification process in the USA but would be considered a
      Class II device as part of the Neurotech Vital Device.

      The purpose of this validation study is to establish the suitability of the Neurotech Vital
      device in which the treatment stimulation parameters have been markedly attenuated (defined
      as 'modified Neurotech Vital device') prior to its use as one of the treatments in a
      randomised, controlled, double-blind study to be conducted in patients with stress urinary
      incontinence in Germany (Study No: BMR-11-1002).

    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate that no volunteers elicit a contraction of the pelvic floor muscle with the Modified Neurotech Vital Device and that all the volunteers elicit a contraction of the pelvic floor muscle with the Neurotech Vital Device. Contraction of the pelvic floor muscles will be assessed by using sonographic/real time ultrasound imaging/recording (mean of three measurements of pelvic floor displacement achieved during maximum threshold intensity electrical stimulation).</description>
