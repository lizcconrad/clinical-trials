  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By creating a registry, physicians will have the opportunity to understand the clinical
      outcomes of Myositis patients treated with Acthar. Despite the availability of clinical
      exams, muscle biopsies, and other testing, it is surmised that there may be a more important
      classification of myositis that physicians are not diagnosing which could possibly lead to
      improper treatment due to inaccurate diagnosis. There may be several types of immune and
      inflammatory myositis (IIM) that do not fit well into the typical sub classifications of
      myositis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective and prospective data will be collected from physicians who have prescribed
      Acthar to myositis patients to determine what specific characteristics each patient has based
      on biopsy analysis, laboratory results, and clinical exams. Through biopsy analysis,
      subcategories of IIM will be determined and could illustrate which of these IIMs may be more
      responsive to Acthar therapy.

        All sites chosen are well-established universities, academic centers or private practices
        that specialize in neuromuscular diseases. These are physicians who have several myositis
        patients and who are prescribing or would prescribe Acthar to myositis patients
