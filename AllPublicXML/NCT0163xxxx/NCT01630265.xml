  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies demonstrate that patients often have difficulty understanding their
      discharge instructions. Video discharge instructions have the potential to mitigate factors
      such as illiteracy and limited physician time, which may affect comprehension. Our goal is to
      determine if adding video discharge instructions affects caregivers' understanding of their
      child's emergency department (ED) visit, plan and follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of patients, age 29 days to 18 years, with a diagnosis of fever, vomiting or
      diarrhea, and wheezing or asthma were randomized into written or video discharge instruction
      groups. In the ED, caregivers read standard written discharge instructions or watched a
      3-minute video based on their child's diagnosis. They were then asked questions regarding
      information covered in these instructions. After completing the 20-point questionnaire,
      standard discharge procedure was followed. Caregivers were contacted by phone 2-5 days after
      discharge for a follow-up questionnaire. Usefulness of the discharge instructions was also
      assessed.

    <time_frame>up to 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>After reading standard written discharge instructions or watching a 3 minute video covering the information in the written discharge instructions, a questionnaire was completed by each caregiver. Knowledge was assessed based on the number of correct responses given by each caregiver at the time of ED discharge and 2-5 days post-discharge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver satisfaction with their discharge instructions</measure>
    <time_frame>Satisfaction will be assessed at two time points within 5 days of being evaluated in the Emergency Department</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers either read standard written discharge instructions or watched a 3 minute video covering the information in the discharge instructions. Caregivers were then asked to rate their satisfaction with the discharge instructions using a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
