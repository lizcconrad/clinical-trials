      Calcium (Ca2+) and vitamin D (VitD) play an important role in child health. Aims. The
      investigators evaluated the daily intake of Ca2+ and VitD in healthy children; and the
      efficacy of Ca2+ and VitD supplementation. Daily Ca2 + and VitD intake was evaluated in
      consecutive healthy children through a validated questionnaire. Subjects with a daily Ca2 +
      and VitD intake &lt; 70% of dietary reference intakes (DRIs) were invited to participate in
      prospective randomized trial with 2 groups of nutritional intervention: group 1, dietary
      counseling aiming to optimize daily Ca2+ and VitD intake plus administration of a
      commercially available Ca2 + and VitD supplementation product (Colecalcium®, Humana, Milan,
      Italy); group 2, dietary counseling alone. At the enrollment (T0) and after 4 months (T1)
      serum VitD levels were assessed.

    <description>Daily Ca2+ and VitD intake was determined using a previously validated written dietary questionnaire, filled by the parents with the help of a registered dietitian. Eventual assumption of Ca2+ and/or VitD supplements or fortified foods was also registered. All questionnaires were collected and analyzed using a specific software based on the Italian food composition tables (Winfood, Medimatica SRL, Martinsicuro, Teramo, Italy). All data were recorded in a specific clinical chart before statistical analysis. All subjects with less than 70% of the DRIs were invited to participate in a randomized trial aiming to investigate the efficacy of different nutritional interventions. The dietitian gave information to the parents on how to improve the consumption of foods rich in Ca2+ and VitD according to DRIs. No nutritional support products were prescribed in children enrolled in group 2.</description>
