  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stones cause severe pain. Patients with a stone lodged in the ureter (the tube that
      drains the bladder), require urgent treatment with a stent to relieve the blockage. This
      tube, or ureteral stent, gives the patient relief until they can have their stone treated.
      This study is to evaluate a new type of ureteral stent to relieve pain from kidney stones.
      This stent is designed to drain the kidney and unlike other ureteral stents, is also designed
      to widen the ureter to help the stone pass on its own.

      This study is to evaluate a new type of ureteral stent to relieve kidney obstruction from a
      stone lodged in the ureter. This stent would be placed when a patient presents with pain in
      the Emergency Room or clinic in a patient that has no signs of infection. It is designed to
      continue drainage of the kidney and unlike other ureteral stents, is also designed to help
      dilate the ureter to facilitate spontaneous stone passage. This means the stent may also be
      therapeutic and the patient would be less likely to undergo another procedure to have the
      stone removed. Research performed at the Stone Centre at VGH shows that in ex vivo pig
      kidneys, this stent provides very good urinary drainage of the kidney. This has been
      published in a peer-reviewed journal (Lange D, Hoag NA, Poh BK, Chew BH. Drainage
      characteristics of the 3F MicroStent using a novel film occlusion anchoring mechanism. J
      Endourol. 2011 Jun;25(6):1051-6.).

    <measure>Relief of hydronephrosis (fluid in kidney causing kidney swelling)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks following stent placement</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will return for radiographic test(s) after the stent placement as determined by the physician which can include kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) x-ray, renal and bladder ultrasound, or CT scan. This imaging helps determine 2 things: the degree of kidney swelling (hydronephrosis), stent migration and whether their stone is still present or not.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 post stent placement, and days 1 and 7 post stent removal</time_frame>
    <description>Before stent placement the subject will complete Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire. After stent placement and discharge home study questionnaires will be completed each day at the end of the day, until stent removal which will be in approximately 7 days. Each VAS questionnaire takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The subject will be instructed to bring these at their clinic visit for stent removal at Vancouver General Hospital. After the stent removal 2 more questionnaires are completed, at 1 day and at 7 days. These are sent back in a stamped return envelope.</description>
