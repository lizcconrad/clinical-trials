  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion (up to 60%) of myeloma patients treated with Bortezomib or
      thalidomide or both develop significant peripheral neuropathy (PN). Standard of care for this
      complication include drugs like gabapentin or pregabalin, which relieve symptoms only
      partially. PN of grade II or above mandates reduction in dose or frequency of Bortezomib or
      thalidomide, which may compromise treatment outcome. This clinical study explores whether, by
      intervening early in its course using acupuncture, progression of PN can be reversed,
      stabilized or retarded thereby allowing continuation of treatment on schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. The acupuncture treatment will start after patients have received at least 3 weeks of
           Gabapentin or Pregabalin at adequate dose without improvement in PN

        2. Two sessions of acupuncture per week, each of 30minutes duration, will be administered
           for a total of 10 sessions over 5 weeks. The needling will be done by the designated
           acupuncturist for all patients, delivered with electrical stimulation at a defined
           frequency.

        3. A fixed set of acupoints will be applied which include both local and distant points,
           based on both symptoms of PN and classification of TCM syndrome. Some degree of
           flexibility with addition or reduction of acupoints is allowed based on clinical
           indication. The acupoints needled each session will be recorded.

        4. Assessment of efficacy 4.1 Objective response : A complete neurological examination will
           be done at commencement of acupuncture and at end of acupuncture.

      In addition, a full nerve conduction test will be done at beginning of acupuncture and at the
      end of 10 sessions of acupuncture.

      4.2 Subjective assessment A quality of life questionnaire (FACT/GOG-NTX v4) will be filled in
      by patients at enrolment, commencement, at the 6th session and at the end of 10 sessions of
      acupuncture.

      4.3 Scoring With both objective and subjective assessment, a Total Neuropathy Score can be
      calculated at each time point as a quantitative measurement of the severity of PN

      5. Statistical considerations The statistical analysis specifies that a lower limit of the
      two-sided 90 percent confidence interval for the overall positive response that exceeded 10
      percent would be considered to be evidence of significant efficacy of acupuncture in
      retarding Bortezomib or thalidomide induced PN. Allowing a confidence interval width of 30%,
      the sample size needed will be 34 patients. To allow for a 10% drop-out, we plan to recruit a
      total of 40 patients

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 21 years and have a diagnosis of a plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoma.

          2. Patients must have neuropathy greater or equal to 2 according to CTCAE v 3.0 scale in
             spite of adequate duration (at least 3 weeks) of previous treatment with Gabapentin or
             Pregabalin or are unable to tolerate these drugs. Patients receiving any of these
             drugs must remain on the same medications throughout the study period; however, minor
             adjustments in dosage are allowed.

        3. The patient's current or previous treatment must include bortezomib or thalidomide

        4. ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Local infection at or near the acupuncture site. (Although acupuncture is a minimally
             invasive procedure, patients will be excluded if there is an indication of active
             infection.)

          2. Thrombocytopenia (platelet counts &lt; 50x 109/L) on the day of acupuncture session

          3. Deformities that could interfere with accurate acupuncture point location or out of
             energy pathway as defined by traditional acupuncture theory.

          5. Known coagulopathy and taking heparin (including low molecular weight heparin) or
             warfarin at any dose. Patients on aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are
             allowed to participate.

          6. Persistent absolute neutrophil counts of &lt; 1 x 109/L

          7. Active CNS disease.

          8. Patients having a cardiac pacemaker.
