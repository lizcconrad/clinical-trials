  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators piloted a uniform acupuncture treatment protocol
      among adults with depression who were taking an antidepressant medication that was providing
      only partial or no symptom alleviation. The study's aims were evaluate the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of acupuncture augmentation treatment among this population. The
      investigators hypothesized that acupuncture as an augmentation treatment would be associated
      with a response rate of at least 50%, which the investigators defined as a decrease in
      depressive symptoms from the beginning to the end of the study of 50% or more, and that the
      response would be greater among patients who received acupuncture 2 times per week (vs. 1
      time per week). The investigators also hypothesized that acupuncture would be associated with
      minimal side effects.

    <description>The HAM-D-17 is a clinician-rated measure of patient depressive symptoms (structured interview). Higher cumulative scores indicate more severe depression. A 50% or greater reduction in HAM-D-17 from baseline to endpoint was considered representative of our hypothesized acupuncture-augmentation response rate of at least 50%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18-65

          -  A HAM-D-17 score of &gt;= 14

          -  Partial or nonresponse to a standard antidepressant (monotherapy or combination) at an
             adequate dose over the past 8 or more weeks (natural agents such as omega-3 fatty
             acids, St John's wort, SAMe, and folic acid, were allowed as antidepressants)

          -  Concurrent psychotherapy was allowed, provided that it was not initiated within the 3
             months prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A primary diagnosis other than major depressive disorder, or any history of psychosis
             or mania

          -  Conditions that could make it difficult to conclusively determine that depressive
             symptoms were the result of major depression and not some other condition, including
             any form of substance abuse or dependence within the last 6 months, other medical
             conditions that could be the basis of a depression (including epilepsy, history of an
             abnormal EEG, severe head trauma, or stroke)

          -  Serious uncontrolled medical conditions (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, severe
             congestive heart failure), or other medical conditions that had not been stable for at
             least 3 months
