  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and other surgical complications are common after
      pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) and POPF is a major complication. The drainage of pancreatic duct
      is important and a stent is usually placed in the operation, but it is still controversial
      whether the stent drainage is internal or external.

      The current study is to compare the rate of Postoperative pancreatic fistula(POPF) and other
      surgical complications after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).
