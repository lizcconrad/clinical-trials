  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of LY3023703 in healthy participants. The purposes of this study are
      to look at safety, how well the study drug is tolerated, how much of the study drug gets into
      the blood stream, and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to humans.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. Participants will
      remain in the study for approximately 3 months. This study is for research purposes only and
      is not intended to treat any medical condition.
