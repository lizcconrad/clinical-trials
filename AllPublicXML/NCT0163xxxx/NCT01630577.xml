      We conducted this study to assess the value of early change in central venous pressure (CVP)
      in predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with shock a primary goal of treatment is to restore and maintain organ
      perfusion, for which an adequate cardiac preload is required. Apart from the situations in
      which hypovolemia is evident and a favourable response to fluid administration will be seen,
      clinical and biological parameters often fail to predict hypovolemia. Inappropriate use of
      volume expansion carries out the risk of generating volume overload and pulmonary oedema.
      Consequently, reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness are needed especially in the early
      phase of cardiocirculatory deterioration. In the clinical setting, different static and
      dynamic indices have been shown to be useful indicators of cardiac preload. Central venous
      pressure (CVP) is widely used to measure right ventricular preload in patients requiring
      invasive hemodynamic monitoring. However, the use of the CVP is much criticized because CVP
      poorly predicts cardiac preload and volume status. However several decades ago, Weil and
      Henning proposed the fluid challenge technique, based on the 2-5 rule using CVP. There is a
      method for guiding volume repletion based on measurements of the patient's response to fluid
      load. This method has not been validated in the prediction of fluid responsiveness. We
      therefore conducted a prospective study that in all patients we measured CVP change and
      stroke volume variation (SVV) after administration of fluids. Patients were classified as
      fluid responders when their SVV is &gt;10% after volume expansion and non-responders if SVV is
      ≤10%.
