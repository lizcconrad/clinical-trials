  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study protocol is to collect imaging data on embryos followed to
      blastocyst stage (Day 5-6) and correlate Eeva System parameters with comprehensive chromosome
      screening (CCS) results, implantation and live birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was designed to determine if there is a correlation between the Eeva System
      parameters and CCS results. Embryos will be selected for transfer based on CCS results and
      morphology. The Clinical site will have no access to the Eeva analysis at the time of the
      transfer.
