  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the use of bare metal stents is associated with
      restenosis in approximately 10% to 50% of cases.

      Stenting may induce endothelial damage/dysfunction and inflammatory reactions, which in turn
      delay healing and endothelialization and may lead to restenosis and atherosclerosis within
      the stented segments.

      The sedative and antinausea drug thalidomide has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory
      and antioncogenic properties that could be of benefit in case of PCI with stenting.

      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the use of bare metal stents is associated with
      restenosis in approximately 10% to 50% of cases.

      Stenting may induce endothelial damage/dysfunction and inflammatory reactions, which in turn
      delay healing and endothelialization and may lead to restenosis and atherosclerosis within
      the stented segments.

      Indeed, experimental studies indicate a marked activation of inflammatory cells at the site
      of stent struts, which is likely to play a key role in the process of neointimal
      proliferation and restenosis. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor and interleukins 1 and 6 are
      powerful stimuli for smooth muscle cell proliferation.

      The sedative and antinausea drug thalidomide has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory
      and antioncogenic properties that could be of benefit in case of PCI with stenting.

      The primary objective of this study is to carry out a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of oral thalidomide on restenosis rate after
      successful stent implantation.
