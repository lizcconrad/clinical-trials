      This study evaluates the diagnostic efficacy of CAP System (capsulated hydrophilic carrier
      polymer) for recombinant tropomyosin from shrimp extract in discriminating between subjects
      allergic to shrimp with CAP positive subjects allergic to mites, crustaceans asymptomatic but
      with a positive CAP to shrimp, to identify those at greatest risk of food reactions.

    <textblock>
      Most epidemiological data related to allergy to shellfish come from the USA, where 2.5% of
      the adult population is subject to an allergy to shellfish, which is also the leading cause
      of anaphylaxis in adults in these areas. This allergy affects also the European adult
      population, so that the crustaceans were included in the European Directive 2003/89/EC on the
      labeling requirement to indicate any allergenic ingredients (listed in Annex 3 a) used in the
      production of a food and present, although in other form, in the finished product. The
      allergen mainly involved in allergic reactions to shellfish food is the tropomyosin protein
      of PM of about 34-36 kDa, isolated for the first time in the shrimp (Pen to 1), involved in
      the mechanisms of muscle activation and identified in the muscle fiber of many crustaceans
      (Pen i 1, Cha f 1, Cra c 1, Hom a 1, v 1 Lit, Pan s 1, Pen m 1) and molluscs (Hel as 1, d 1
      Hal, Cra g 1, Oct 1 st, Tod p 1). The tropomyosins, identified in many other invertebrates,
      such as dust mites and cockroaches, seem to be cross-reactive with each other, suggesting the
      role of allergens inside of the Invertebrates. In those circumstances, the positivity of
      specific IgE for the crustaceans can thus be determined also by sensitization to tropomyosin
      even for simple cross-reactivity with tropomyosin of the mites, which represents a minor
      allergen Der known as p10.

    <description>Will be carried out the assay of specific IgE to the extract of shrimp and other shellfish and dust mites by the CAP System.On the same blood sample will be also made for the CAP recombinant major allergens Der p1,Der p2 and tropomyosin recombinant mite Der p 10 and the recombinant shrimp tropomyosin Pen a 1.The test consists of a reaction between allergens covalently bound to a solid phase(ImmunoCAP) and the specific IgE in the serum.This reaction is highlighted by the use of anti-IgE conjugated with an enzyme and the subsequent addition of a reagent of development</description>

    <description>After separation by SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate - PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) proteins are transferred thanks to an electric field on a nitrocellulose membrane, which will subsequently be cut into strips. Each strip will be incubated with the serum of a patient; the binding of specific IgE to allergenic proteins will be detected by anti-human IgE antibodies radiolabeled with I125. Using autoradiographic films will be highlighted so the pattern corresponding to the specific IgE-binding allergenic profile recognized by each patient studied and related to both mite and shrimp.</description>

        Will be selected a group of patients (group A) consisted of 50 subjects with a history of
        allergic reactions to shellfish, both slight localized to the oral cavity than severe
        systemic, these patients will show positive IgE to the extract of whole shrimp. In this

        mites, both symptomatic and asymptomatic
