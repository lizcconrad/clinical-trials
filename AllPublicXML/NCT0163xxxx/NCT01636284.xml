    <textblock>
      This study is to determine how effectively JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) will prolong life in patients
      with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who have not been previously treated with
      sorafenib, and the safe administration of JX-594 in five weekly IV infusions.

    <description>Enrolled patients will receive 5 weekly IV infusions on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. After Day 43, if their disease has improved or remained stable and they have not started other cancer therapy, they may be able to continue to receive JX-594 via IV infusion every three weeks. This treatment extension may continue until radiologic progressive disease, initiation of other cancer therapy, or patient withdrawal.</description>
