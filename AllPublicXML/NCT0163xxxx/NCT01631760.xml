  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that there is a statistically significant difference in miRNA profiling and
      expression of subjects with asthma upon its exacerbation compared to patient's baseline level
      or following effective treatment of an exacerbation of asthma. Therefore, plasma miRNA
      profiling may provide noninvasive, highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for asthma
      exacerbation's detection and treatment follow-up.

        Both genders of any racial or ethnic group, age 5-85 are eligible. The subjects should not
        have participated in any other experimental study in the last 30 days.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Literacy: The subject must be able to read and comprehend English. Consent: The
             subject must have the ability to give informed consent. Type of subject: The subject
             must be seen in the outpatient setting at one of the clinics staffed by faculty
             members of the Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine,
             University of South Florida College of Medicine.

          -  Asthma: The subject must have a history of physician diagnosed asthma for at least 1
             year and must have a current exacerbation of asthma requiring oral
             glucocorticosteroids. Asthma exacerbation is defined below.

        Asthma exacerbation (relapse or de novo) is defined as either:

          1. An increase of asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and /or shortness of
             breath) that does not resolve within 2 hours after the use of rescue albuterol or
             corticosteroids and requires a medical visit or

          2. During a scheduled visit, the subject has acute worsening of asthma symptoms and a
             reduction of &gt;20% in peak flow, which in the opinion of the investigator requires
             treatment with oral glucocorticosteroids.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Any other coexistent lung disease (COPD, interstitial lung disease, allergic
             bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, TB, sarcoidosis).

          -  Any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study
             participation or would confound the interpretation of the results if the
             condition/disease exacerbates during the study. The list of conditions/diseases that
             will result in exclusion if determined to be clinically significant includes, but is
             not limited to: uncontrolled hypertension; hematological, hepatic, neurological,
             thyroid, peptic ulcer, or renal disease; immunologic compromise; current malignancy.

          -  Past or current use of tobacco (&lt;10 pack year smoking history and no smoking within
             the last 5 years).
