  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: In this study we will develop and apply imaging techniques to perform the first
      three-dimensional (3-D) measurements of brain biomechanics during mild head movement in
      healthy human subjects. Biomechanics is the application of mechanics, or the physical
      principles in action when force is applied to an object, to the anatomical structure and/or
      function of organisms. Such techniques will be invaluable for building computational models
      of brain biomechanics, understanding variability of brain biomechanics across individual
      characteristics, such as age and sex, and determining brain sub-structures at risk for damage
      when movement of the head is accelerated, such as during a traumatic event.

      Study Population: Measurements will be performed on 90 healthy men and women aged 18-50.

      Design: We will build upon the model pioneered by our collaborator, Dr. Philip Bayly. The
      model places a human subject in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner with one of two head
      support units that allows a specific range of motion. Each head support is latched such that
      it can be released by the subject, and results in either a rotation of the head of
      approximately 30 degrees or a flexion-extension of the head of approximately 4 degrees.
      Although both supports are weighted so that the motion is repeatable if the subject is
      relaxed, the subject can easily counteract the weight. The resulting
      acceleration/deceleration is small (in the range of normal activities, such as turning one's
      head during swimming) and has been validated and used in other human investigations of brain
      biomechanics. The subject repeats the motion multiple times during the MR scan under their
      own volition and desired pace to measure motion of the head and brain.

      Outcome measures: This project is a pilot study evaluating the potential of extracting
      three-dimensional estimates of brain deformation, such as strain measurements, using MR
      imaging. A primary outcome of this project will be a fast MR acquisition sequence for
      measuring 3-D brain deformation. The sequence will be evaluated by applying the protocol to
      human subjects, followed by preliminary quantification of the reproducibility and stability
      of deformation measurements.
