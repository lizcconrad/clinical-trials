    <textblock>
      CTCL is a rare form of lymphoma of the skin. While early stages are usually confined to the
      skin, later stages may spread to blood, lymph nodes and other organs. At this point, patients
      usually require systemic chemo. This study will investigate the effect of everolimus as
      treatment for recurrent or refractory CTCL. Participation in this study will last as long as
      the study doctor believes disease has not gotten worse, and patients continue to tolerate the
      study medication for a maximum of 1 year. Once off the treatment, patients will be followed
      for two years.

      Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare form of lymphoma of the skin. While early stages are
      usually confined to the skin, later stages may spread to blood, lymph nodes and other organs.
      At this point, patients usually require systemic chemotherapy. This study will investigate
      the effect of everolimus as a treatment for patients diagnosed with CTCL that has either not
      responded to previous treatments or has recurred despite previous treatments. Everolimus is
      the common name for the commercial drug Afinitor® (Novartis). It is approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in kidney and brain cancer. In several different forms
      of lymphomas, everolimus is used as an investigational drug, which means it has not been
      approved by the FDA for this group of diseases.

      Everolimus blocks a protein (mTOR) that helps cells and tumors to grow. Earlier studies have
      indicated that the drug everolimus may work against lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell
      lymphomas. Participation in this study will last as long as the study doctor believes disease
      has not gotten worse, and patients continue to tolerate the study medication for a maximum of
      1 year. Once off the treatment, patients will be followed for two years.

    <description>This will be a prospective, phase II non-randomized, open label study of single agent everolimus for the treatment of CTCL recurrent or refractory to at least one previous treatment other than topical medication. The purpose will be evaluation of safety and anti-tumor response as evaluated by serial skin examinations and assessment of tumor burden in tissue and blood.
This study will be conducted in 2 stages. During stage 1 we will enroll a maximum of 11 subjects to evaluate response rate and will only continue to stage 2, if we observe two or more responses. During stage 2, we will expand the study to an overall N of 28 patients.</description>

    <description>The study drug everolimus will be self-administered (by the patients themselves). The investigator will instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. Everolimus should be administered orally once daily, preferably in the morning, at the same time every day with our without food. Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed.
Everolimus will be administered orally as once daily dose of 10 mg continuously from study day 1 until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.
If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose. All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the study must be recorded.</description>

            <description>Prospective, phase II non-randomized, open label study of single agent everolimus for the treatment of CTCL recurrent or refractory to at least one previous treatment other than topical medication. The purpose will be evaluation of safety and anti-tumor response as evaluated by serial skin examinations and assessment of tumor burden in tissue and blood.
This study will be conducted in 2 stages. During stage 1 we will enroll a maximum of 11 subjects to evaluate response rate and will only continue to stage 2, if we observe two or more responses. During stage 2, we will expand the study to an overall N of 28 patients.
Everolimus will be administered orally as once daily dose of 10 mg continuously from study day 1 until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
