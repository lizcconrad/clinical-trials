      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      GLA5PR GLARS tablet 150mg and Lyrica Capsule 75mg.

      GLA5PR GLARS tablet 150mg is a New Formulation which is made by GL Pharm Tech.

      GLARS(Geometrically Long Absorption Regulated System) is New Solution to Sustained Absorption
      by Extending the Absorption Site.

      To overcome the shortcomings of the currently existing sustained release drug delivery
      technologies the investigators have recently developed a novel drug delivery system to enable
      a drug to be dissolved irrespective of the surrounding environment and further absorbed up to
      colon. The investigators coined this &quot;Geometrically Long Absorption Regulated System(GLARS)&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basically, this system is a triple-layered tablet, comprised of upper and lower layers that
      swell and draw a sufficient amount of water, plus a highly water - soluble middle layer that
      rapidly draw water into the tablet core simultaneously.

      The water drawn into the tablet (about 3 to 4 times the weight of the tablet itself)
      functions as an additional media which enables additional and later drug release out of the
      dosage form. This serves to overcome the shortage of surrounding media that has been reported
      to be one of the key reasons for mal-absorption of a drug in colon.

      As the middle layer induces a rapid water draw into the tablet core, the penetrated water
      also diffuses to the upper and lower layers, which makes the tablet to rapidly swell and
      controls drug release.

      At virtually the same time, the swollen upper and lower layers form to surround a lateral
      side of the middle layer, which can, in turn, further control drug release.

      This relatively rigid swollen matrix structure makes drug release not affected by surrounding
      mechanical flux, which can provide relatively consistent in vivo drug release irrespective of
      degree of gastrointestinal motility.
