  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to determine the efficacy and duration of analgesia with the
      addition of Clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, to local anesthetic blockade using bupivacaine, of
      the great auricular nerve in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery.

      The surgical anesthesia during the operative procedure will be maintained using volatile
      anesthetics. No prophylactic dexamethasone or ondansetron would be provided to any patients
      in either group. Anesthesia will be discontinued at the end of the procedure and the patient
      will be extubated once standard extubation criteria have been met. Patients will be then
      taken to the postoperative recovery room where they will be evaluated for pain and discomfort
      by a blinded observer using the CHIPPS (Children and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale). If
      two consecutive pain scores at 5 minute intervals is &gt;6, they will be rescued with
      incremental doses of 0.05 mg/kg of intravenous morphine required to reach a score of &lt;6. The
      number of rescue doses as well as the pain scores will be documented. These patients will be
      also observed for the presence of nausea/vomiting. Any patient who vomits more than two times
      will be rescued with ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg intravenously. All patients will be continued to
      be evaluated in the 23 hour unit. Pain and side effects will be assessed for the next 6 hours
      or until discharge from the 23 hour observation facility. Standard doses of acetaminophen
      with codeine will be provided for pain relief in the 23 hour observational unit, as well as
      on discharge. The number of doses of acetaminophen with codeine will be recorded. Time to
      discharge from the hospital will also be noted. A questionnaire designed to address
      parent/patient satisfaction will be utilized and will allude to the need for rescue analgesia
      and the need for any other additional analgesics provided. The use of any additional rescue
      pain medication will be provided to the families at the time of discharge. A follow-up phone
      call will be made in 24 hours to note the information provided on the questionnaire.
