      This is a clinical trial comparing standard therapy in the use of either lightweight or heavy
      mesh for the repair of inguinal hernias. Both types of these meshes have been approved for
      surgical correction but subjective comparisons of patient overall satisfaction and perceived
      outcomes have not been measured. The investigators intend to measure certain subjective data
      in the form of a questionnaire will be issued to the patient preoperatively, one week, one
      month, six months, and one year after the surgery There is no recent literature comparing
      subjective data between two meshes called Ultra Pro and Surgi Pro. The biological effects of
      these meshes have identical properties as far as the healing process and inflammation as well
      as the low rate of infection. The main difference is the material that these meshes are
      composed of. The Ultra Pro is made of Prolene while the Surgi Pro is made of polypropylene.

      The risks are not increased anymore than that for normal surgical complications. They each
      have the same post operative risks including bleeding, infection and pain, but the
      investigators are investigating a possible subjective difference between these two separate
      meshes that are currently used.
