  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is strongly associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data increasingly
      suggest that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation -- or increased abdominal fat -- is
      particularly deleterious to cardiovascular health, but further study is needed to test this
      idea. Increased abdominal fat may also be associated with lower secretion of a hormone called
      growth hormone (GH), which helps the body burn fat. The current study aims to carefully
      characterize relationships between abdominal fat and CVD. In addition, by using a medication
      called growth hormone releasing hormone, which is a strategy to reduce abdominal fat, the
      investigators will test the hypothesis that abdominal fat contributes uniquely to increased
      arterial inflammation.

      In the first part of this study, the investigators will investigate both lean (healthy
      weight) individuals and individuals with increased abdominal fat. The investigators will
      study their body composition, cardiovascular risk measures, insulin sensitivity, and growth
      hormone dynamics, with the hypothesis that abdominal fat, independent of general obesity,
      will be strongly associated with arterial wall thickening and atherosclerotic inflammation.
      The investigators will assess arterial wall thickness, plaque morphology, and atherosclerotic
      inflammation, and the investigators will determine associations between these variables and
      regional fat accumulation, with particular attention to abdominal fat.

      The second, treatment part of the study will be only for individuals with increased abdominal
      fat who are found to have low growth hormone secretion. In that part of the study, the
      investigators will test the effects of a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue to
      reduce abdominal fat and, consequently, reduce arterial inflammation. The investigators
      hypothesize that abdominal fat reduction, independent of changes in growth hormone, will
      reduce arterial inflammation and arterial wall thickness.
