    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation
      solution (2.5 mcg and 5 mcg) delivered via Respimat® inhaler once daily in the evening over
      12 weeks, compared to placebo, as add-on controller therapy on top of usual care in children

        <description>Change from baseline in Interviewer-Administered Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-IA) total score measured at week 12.
The ACQ-IA is a scale containing 7 questions. Each question has a 7 point scale which ranges from 0 to 6. A score of 0 corresponds to no impairment and a score of 6 corresponds to maximum impairment. ACQ-IA total score is calculated as the mean of the responses to all 7 questions.
