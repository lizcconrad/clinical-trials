    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the intestinal absorption of calcium from a
      newly developed calcium carbonate-vitamin D3 chewable tablet formulation increases the amount
      of calcium excreted in urine and decreases parathyroid hormone (PTH) in serum as compared to
      baseline.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Calcichew. This study will look at calcium
      absorption in healthy postmenopausal women and healthy men.

      The study will enroll approximately 55 healthy adults. All participants will receive
      Calcichew.

      All participants will be asked to take one chewable tablet at the same time each day for
      three days in period 2 of the trial.

      This trial will be conducted at one clinical site in Germany. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 4 weeks. Participants will make 9 visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 7days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
