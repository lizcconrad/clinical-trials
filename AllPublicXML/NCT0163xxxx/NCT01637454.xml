    <textblock>
      Various vasoconstrictors have shown promising results in the management of type 1 hepatorenal
      syndrome (HRS). However, there are very few studies on vasopressors in the management of type
      2 HRS. Terlipressin has been used commonly; however it is costly and not available in some
      countries. In the present study, the investigators evaluated safety and efficacy of
      terlipressin and noradrenaline in the treatment of type 2 HRS

    <description>Patients in group A received terlipressin as an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg every 6 h. If a significant reduction in serum creatinine level (≥1 mg/dL) was not observed during 3-day period, the dose of terlipressin was increased in a stepwise fashion every 3 days to a maximum of 2 mg every 6 hour.</description>

    <description>Patients in group B received a continuous infusion of noradrenaline at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/hour, designed to achieve an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 10mmHg or an increase in 4-h urine output to more than 200 mL. When one of these goals was not achieved, the noradrenaline dose increased every 4 hour in steps of 0.5 mg/hour, up to the maximum dose of 3 mg/hour</description>
