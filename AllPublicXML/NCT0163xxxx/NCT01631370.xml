  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal sympathetic nerves contribute to development of hypertension. Sympathetic overactivity
      also induces insulin resistance and it could therefore be assumed that a renal denervation
      might improve insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that glucose metabolism is improved in
      patients with treatment resistant essential hypertension both 1 and 3 months after renal
      denervation compared to a control group with treatment resistant essential hypertension.
      Fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide decreased significantly as did insulin resistance
      assessed by HOMA-IR. The investigators wish to investigate the effect of renal denervation on
      insulin sensitivity using the gold standard - the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and to
      investigate the degree of insulin resistance in muscle, liver and adipose tissue.

    <description>To assess insulin sensitivity the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is used. The patients are given 0.8 mU/kg/min insulin as an infusion for 2 hours and the blood glucose is clamped at 5 mmol/l. For assessment of endogenous glucose production (EGP) during the glucose clamps, a tracer (3-3 H glucose) is added to the glucose infusion. The patients will be examined by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp prior to the renal denervation and 6 months after.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Two biopsies from the lateral vastus muscle and two biopsies from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue are obtained under local anesthesia. Biopsies are taken at baseline and during the clamp. Protein expression involved in the insulin signalling cascade is assessed using standard western blotting techniques.</description>
