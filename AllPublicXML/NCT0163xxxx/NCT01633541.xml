  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate a new treatment approach for adults with advanced laryngeal cancer: induction
      chemotherapy with platinum and docetaxel plus AT-101. AT-101 is an investigational drug for
      the treatment of advanced cancer. It is hoped that the combination of this chemotherapy
      regimen will allow cancer patients to keep their voice box and to improve/maintain
      voice-related quality of life. The ultimate goal of this study is to prevent the surgery to
      remove subjects voice box.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Published data demonstrate equal efficacy and improved quality of life when platinum and a
      taxane were compared with platinum and 5-Fluorouracil [31]. Additionally, weekly cisplatin
      regimens (30-40 mg/m2) with radiotherapy appear to be equally efficacious and better
      tolerated than standard high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/ m2) regimens with radiation therapy for
      locally advanced SCCHN [32] The investigators will thus attempt to reduce toxicity from
      induction chemotherapy with the use of docetaxel/cisplatin (or carboplatin) (TP) in place of
      our previously used standard regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) and administer
      weekly cisplatin (or carboplatin) with radiation for those patients who are responders to
      induction therapy. Finally, Phase I/II testing of the small molecule inhibitor, AT-101, has
      recently been completed, and suggests activity in solid tumors when combined with cytotoxic
      agents. Since the investigators have achieved such high survival rates with our treatment
      selection approach in laryngeal cancer, our ultimate goal is to reduce the rate of salvage
      laryngectomy which should improve quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that
      specific inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL function can increase response rates to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and decrease the need for salvage laryngectomy. Hence, the investigators propose
      this study: the treatment of patients with advanced SCC of the larynx with one cycle of
      platinum plus docetaxel with AT-101, followed by chemoradiotherapy for those responding to
      this induction regimen and reserving total laryngectomy for those who are non-responders.

    <description>The primary clinical objective of this trial is to compare the larynx preservation rates in a treatment paradigm that uses induction chemotherapy plus AT-101 to select patients for either concurrent chemoradiation or surgery. Organ preservation rate, defined as alive and free from indication for laryngectomy three months post treatment, was chosen as the primary endpoint because it provides evidence to fully characterize clinically the effect of the treatment strategy</description>

    <description>platinum/docetaxel + AT-101 The platinum will either be cisplatin or carboplatin as deemed best by the medical oncologist.
(Both Arms) Day #1: Patients will undergo induction chemotherapy with (TP) docetaxel (Taxotere) 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (or Carboplatin AUC 6).
(AT-101 Arm) Days #1-3: Patients will receive AT-101 40 mg orally twice daily On Day 23 (+/- 3 days), there will be a direct laryngoscopy (DL) with tumor biopsy and blood draw, repeat CT scan of the neck with perfusion within a week biopsy.</description>
