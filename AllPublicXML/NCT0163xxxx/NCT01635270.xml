      The purpose of this study is to establish on the market and to clinically evaluate a new
      strategy of treatment for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer using
      deformable repositioning of 4D imaging.

    <description>The midP strategy defines the target as the time weighted average tumor position (mid-position) plus an additional margin, computed specifically for each patient, that takes into account the tumor motion in each direction. This strategy can help to safely reduce toxicity while preserving treatment efficacy</description>

    <description>The ITV strategy is the conventional one. It consists in defining the target as the volume covering the whole tumor motion.</description>
