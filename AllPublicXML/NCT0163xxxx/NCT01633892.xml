    <textblock>
      Traumatic facial injuries, especially those sustained in military combat, are characterized
      by destruction of bone and soft tissue. While the bony structures of the face can be
      reconstructed, it is difficult to return the soft tissue back to its original form. Many
      times, fat grafting, a common cosmetic and reconstructive procedure, is used in hopes of
      improving the soft tissue deformity. Fat grafting is a procedure in which a person's own fat
      is taken from areas throughout the body, usually the thighs or abdomen, with a small
      liposuction tube. The fat is then transferred into the area that has lost volume or fullness.
      The fullness of the soft tissue area may decrease over time because the transferred fat can
      be reabsorbed by the body. Altering the current fat grafting procedure, slightly, could lead
      to less reabsorption and a lasting fullness of the soft tissue area outcome of the fat graft
      procedure.

      The investigators are conducting this research study to help us improve the surgical
      treatment of people who have suffered facial soft tissue loss as a result of trauma. The goal
      of this research study is to see how each person's fat grafts will maintain the fat over time
      and to measure the quality of life during a 9 month post-surgical follow-up period. The total
      duration of participation is approximately 11-12 months. In this study, the investigators
      will concentrate the fat in the fat grafting procedure to determine whether this process will
      maintain the fat over time. The areas treated with enhanced fat grafts will be compared with
      areas treated with standard of care fat grafts. At least two areas of your face will be
      treated with fat grafts, (standard of care fat grafts and concentrated fat grafts).

      This study is the second of two clinical studies at the University of Pittsburgh using each
      person's fat graft with concentration of fat cells in the graft to observe if there is less
      fat resorption compared to using fat grafts alone. Each study is using a different
      concentration of fat in the fat graft compared to the first clinical study.

      Craniofacial injuries have serious psychosocial sequele and affect quality of life. Many
      individuals who suffer significant facial disfigurement from injury experience psychological
      distress and impairment in functioning not limited to the acute phase of injury, but over a
      longer term period of treatment, recovery, and adjustment. Until recently, treatment of
      disfiguring craniofacial injuries has been mostly limited to surgical flap procedures,
      microsurgical tissue transfer, and implantable prostheses. However, these methods can leave
      conspicuous scars on the face and the donor site, and in the case of implants can lead to
      complications associated with foreign materials. Autologous fat grafting with minimally
      invasive cannulas is a procedure that has been used for decades in common plastic surgery
      practice for facial aesthetic procedures. This technique is also a promising treatment for
      soft tissue reconstruction after craniofacial trauma because the graft harvest and injection
      are minimally invasive. The treatment is performed by using a small liposuction cannula to
      aspirate fat tissue from the donor site, and then re-injecting the fat into the recipient
      site with specialized injection cannulas. After harvest, and prior to injection, the fat
      graft is subjected to a mechanical processing step to separate the aqueous layer and
      concentrate the adipocytes. This often takes the form of centrifugation or filtering.

      The main problem with autologous fat grafting is a variable resorption of the graft volume
      over time. As much as 30-60% of the graft volume can diminish over time. Many variables may
      influence the behavior of clinical fat grafts, including harvest site, harvest technique,
      graft preparation, and injection technique.

      Concentrating the already present autologous adipose stromal cells within the fat grafts is
      not expected to increase subject risk levels beyond the risk levels of the application of fat
      grafts. We are currently approved for the application of fat grafts with concentrated
      autologous adipose stromal cells [IRB#10100293]. This proposal uses an increased
      concentration of adipose stromal cells compared to the above referenced study; no increase of
      risk to the subject is anticipated. We hypothesize that fat grafting for facial trauma,
      facilitated by enhancing graft quality with a higher concentration of endogenous autologous
      vascular adipose stromal cells in the grafted tissue, will enhance the successful restoration
      of tissue volume and craniofacial form. The use of a higher concentration of autologous
      adipose stromal cells may lead to lower fat resorption rates that may be observed in the
      approved IRB study [PRO10100293]. Additionally, we hypothesize that the clinical results
      using the concentrated autologous stromal vascular cells will be durable and the subject's
      quality of life scores will be improved compared to subjects who have had fat grafting alone
      using historical controls.

          <title>Fat Grafting</title>
          <description>Autologous fat grafting is a potential solution. Grafting of autologous fat tissue is a minimally invasive surgical technique that starts with the harvest of fat tissue from the abdomen or thighs using liposuction through incisions less than 5mm in length. The lipoaspirate is then processed to concentrate the adipose fraction and reinjected into the donor site. This surgical procedure involves the immediate transplantation of a patient’s own tissue in a single operative procedure. It has the advantages of:
Minimal access incisions
Ability to transfer significant amounts of tissue (hundreds of grams of tissue)
Can be used in setting of previous surgical procedures and presence of hardware
Usually performed as outpatient procedure
Minimal donor site morbidity at graft harvest site
Low risk compared with more invasive surgical procedures
Can be repeated multiple times, if necessary, even using the same donor site</description>
