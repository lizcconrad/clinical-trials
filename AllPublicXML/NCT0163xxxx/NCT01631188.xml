  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to determine if the Endovent pulmonary catheter kit, used for port
      access surgery, can be used as a passageway for a pacing wire. The study hypothesis is that
      the Endovent kit can be used effectively as a passageway for a pacing wire system.

    <textblock>
      Many times cardiac surgery requires the use of epicardial pacing in order to wean the patient
      from bypass. During minimally invasive port access valve surgery, it may not be possible to
      place the leads on the surface of the heart because of the limited surgical exposure. In this
      case, transvenous pacing is used. Minimally invasive port access surgery uses specially
      designed, FDA approved catheters for the procedure. We wish to review the effectiveness of
      being able to place the wires through the catheters and pace the patient.
