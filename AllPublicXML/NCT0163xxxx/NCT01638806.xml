  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are categorized according to the
      electrocardiogram (ECG) findings into: 1) patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction
      (STEMI), 2) patients with Bundle Branch Block Myocardial Infarction (BBBMI), and 3) remaining
      patients with so-called NON-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NONSTEMI).

      Patients with STEMI or BBBMI are treated with acute angioplasty (PPCI=primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention), and the sooner PPCI is performed the lower is the mortality. This is
      why prehospital diagnosis and field-triage of patients with STEMI directly to heart centers
      with PPCI facilities is recommended.

      In patients with NONSTEMI previous trials have indicated that early angioplasty, within 72
      hours of symptom onset, is associated with improved outcome when compared to late angioplasty
      or conservative therapy. No trials have so far been able to diagnose patients with NONSTEMI
      in the prehospital phase or immediately on arrival at a hospital, and triage them directly to
      PPCI. Implementation of point-of-care (POC) testing of biomarkers may enable prehospital or
      early inhospital establishment of the diagnosis NONSTEMI.

      The aim of the present trial is to identify patients with NONSTEMI in the prehospital phase
      or immediately on arrival at the local hospital based on a) symptoms, b) POC testing and c)
      ECG findings and then randomize patients to I) PPCI, or II) medical therapy and
      angiography/angioplasty within 72 hours (todays routine).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present trial patients with a) typical angina pectoris (AP) combined with b1) rise in
      biomarkers on POC testing (prehospital/immediately inhospital) and/or b2) ST-segment
      depression of more than 0.2 mV in two contiguous leads or more than 0.1 mV in four contiguous
      leads are randomized to I) PPCI (same protocol as in STEMI patients) or II) medical therapy
      and angiography/angioplasty within 72 hours (todays routine practice).

      The primary purposes of the present trial is threefold:

        1. To evaluate if it is possible to diagnose patients with NONSTEMI in the prehospital
           phase or immediately on arrival at the hospital (N=250 patients)

        2. To compare a combined endpoint of mortality, re-infarction (during index admission or
           readmitted), or readmission with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) between group I (PPCI
           strategy) and group II (routine strategy) (N=2500 patients).

        3. To compare mortality between group I and II (N=4500 patients).

      Secondary purposes of the present trial is:

        1. To evaluate whether there is difference in the primary endpoints in patients randomized
           within or after 12 hours of symptom onset.

        2. To evaluate whether there is difference in the primary endpoints in patients randomized
           in the prehospital phase and on admission to the hospital, respectively.

        3. To evaluate whether there is difference in the primary endpoints in patients with a
           final diagnosis of AMI, as adjudicated by a clinical event committee.

        4. To evaluate whether there is difference in the primary endpoints in patients with or
           without diabetes, respectively.

        5. To compare a combined endpoint of mortality, readmission with AMI, readmission with CHF,
           readmission with AP, revascularization (not planned on index admission).

        6. To compare a combined safety endpoint of stroke or serious bleeding between group I and
           II.

        7. To evaluate if there is difference in the frequency of PCI and CABG in group I versus
           II.

        8. To compare total admission time between group I and II.

        9. To compare total cost between group I and II.

       10. To compare total duration where the patient is on sick leave between group I and II

    <description>Re-infarction (during index admission or readmitted) adjudicated by and endpoint committee. The endpoint committee is blinded to the initial randomization. The &quot;Universal definition of Myocadial infarction&quot; will be used to classify reinfarction. Biomarkers will be recorded with emphasis on the need of obtaining blood samples until a peak has been reached during index hospitaltization before reinfarction can be considered. Re-infarction will require a 20% relative rise in biomarker level.</description>
