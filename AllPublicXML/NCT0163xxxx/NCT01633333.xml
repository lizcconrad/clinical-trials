  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is commonly used in screening for colorectal cancer. A refined technique of
      colonoscopy involving the use of water as the sole modality to aid colonoscope insertion,
      water exchange, has been described in recent research papers to decrease patient discomfort
      and pain, and to reduce the need for sedation during colonoscopy when compared with standard
      air insufflation. Carbon dioxide insufflation has been described to decrease patient
      discomfort after colonoscopy. No randomized trial has so far compared the use of water
      exchange to carbon dioxide insufflation. Our hypothesis is that water exchange inflicts less
      discomfort to patients undergoing colonoscopy than carbon dioxide insufflation. Patients
      undergoing screening colonoscopy in two centers in Norway, one center in Poland and one
      center in The Netherlands will be enrolled and randomized to examination of either of the two
      methods.
