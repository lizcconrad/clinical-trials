    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label extension study is to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety
      of FG-4592 in maintaining hemoglobin in dialysis and non-dialysis CKD patients who have
      completed the Treatment Period of an FG-4592 FibroGen-sponsored anemia study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, long-term maintenance study of FG-4592 anemia therapy in dialysis and
      non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease patients who have completed the Treatment Period of an
      FG-4592 FibroGen-sponsored anemia Study. Subjects assigned to FG-4592 in the previous study
      will continue to receive the same FG-4592 dose and dosing frequency, unless a dose adjustment
      is required. An optional treatment group may allow subjects assigned to placebo in the
      previous study to start active FG-4592 study treatment.
