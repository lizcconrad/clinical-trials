    <description>Photodynamic therapy is performed using verteporfin. Full dose of verteporfin is infused for 10 minutes, followed by laser delivery at 15 minutes from the start of infusion. Different light dose of PDT is applied to the patients at 50%, 40% and 30% of the full energy based on TAP study. The area of irradiation is set to the abnormal choroidal vascular hyperpermeability on ICGA corresponding to the leaking area on FA.</description>
