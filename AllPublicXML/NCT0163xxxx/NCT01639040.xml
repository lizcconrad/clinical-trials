    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to the end of study (up to Day 78)</time_frame>
    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (from start of administration of first dose of study drug to the end of study [up to Day 78]). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score: Reduction of ≥50 at Day 29 - Censored Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. The efficacy data were set to missing after prohibited medication was used or after the participant was discontinued from the study. Then, all missing values were imputed by simple LOCF.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) From Day 1 (Baseline) to Day 29 (Week 4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>IGA was an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response was an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

          <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD.</description>

          <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report intensity of subject’s pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked following question: how would a subject rate his itch at worst moment during previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0–10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]).</description>

A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event.

        <title>Percent Change in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score From Day 1 (Baseline) to Day 29 (Week 4) - Censored LOCF</title>
        <description>IGA was an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response was an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). The efficacy data were set to missing after prohibited medication was used or after the participant was discontinued from the study. Then, all missing values were imputed by simple LOCF.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 29</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment; it was based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).</population>

        <description>EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. The efficacy data were set to missing after prohibited medication was used or after the participant was discontinued from the study. Then, all missing values were imputed by simple LOCF.</description>
