      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and the therapeutic effect of Decitabine
      in the treatment of elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of the elderly AML patients is very poor. No obvious progress was achieved in
      this field. Decitabine is a kind of specific DNA methylation shift enzyme inhibitor. It can
      reverse the DNA methylation and induce the differentiation and apoptosis of the tumor cells.
      Recent studies about decitabine in the treatment for elderly AML patients had achieved
      inspiring results and indicated that low dose decitabine maybe a good choice for elderly AML
      patients. So in this research the investigators plan to evaluate the safety and the
      therapeutic effect of decitabine in the treatment of elderly AML patients.

If Grade 4 neutropenia（&lt;0.5×10E9/L）come arise after 5 days' cycle of decitabine and lasts more than 14 days in last cycle,the next cycle will decrease dose to 4 days(20 mg/m2, IV ,&gt;1h, on d1-4 of each 28 day cycle).If Grade 4 neutropenia（&lt;0.5×10E9/L）come arise after 4 days' cycle of decitabine and lasts more than 14 days in last cycle,the next cycle will decrease dose to 3 days(20 mg/m2, IV,&gt;1h, on d1-3 of each 28day cycle).</description>
