    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies pregabalin in preventing acute pain syndrome in
      patients receiving paclitaxel. Pregabalin may control the pain caused by cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible effect of pregabalin on
      pain related to paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.
      To obtain pilot data regarding the possible effect of pregabalin on paclitaxel-induced
      peripheral neuropathy. II. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible relative toxicities
      related to pregabalin therapy in this study situation. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To
      characterize neurological testing abnormalities that might occur with the P-APS, and to
      evaluate neurological testing abnormalities during the period of the longer-term
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). II. To determine the PRO incidence and
      characteristics of, and change in, P-APS and paclitaxel induced more chronic CIPN over
      several cycles. These data will serve to confirm the results obtained in our previous natural
      history study N08C1. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I:
      Patients receive pregabalin orally (PO) twice daily (BID), beginning on the first night of
      chemotherapy, for 12 weeks and then once daily (QD) for 1 week. ARM II: Patients receive
      placebo PO BID, beginning on the first night of chemotherapy, for 12 weeks and then QD for 1
      week. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 6
      months.

    <description>Worst of the pain scores for the week following the first cycle of paclitaxel administration, as measured by a question on the daily post-paclitaxel questionnaire. Worst pain over the first 6 days following treatment initiation. Higher scores represent more pain (0: No aches or pains -10: Aches or pains as bad as can be).</description>

    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to 6 days following treatment initiation; up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum of average pain scores over 6 days following initiation of treatment. Average pain over the first 6 days following treatment initiation. Maximum of the average pain scores (item 3, appendix IV; &quot;Please rate the same aches/pain by circling the ONE number that best describes your aches/pains on the AVERAGE in the last 24 hours.&quot;) over the period from treatment initiation to day 7 (for cycle 1). Higher scores represent more pain (0: No aches or pains -10: Aches or pains as bad as can be).</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve Per Assessment (aAUCpa) of Worst, Average and Least Pain (Items 1-3 Appendix IV) for the First Cycle of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to 6 days following treatment initiation; up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of worst, average, and least pain (items 1-3 app. IV; &quot;Please rate any aches/pains that are NEW since your last dose of paclitaxel, and that you think might be related to your chemotherapy treatment by circling ONE number that best describes your aches/pains at its WORST in the last 24 hours.&quot;, &quot;Please rate the same aches/pains by circling the ONE number that best describes your aches/pains at its LEAST in the last 24 hours.&quot;, &quot;Please rate the same aches/pain by circling the ONE number that best describes your aches/pains on the AVERAGE in the last 24 hours.&quot;) for the first cycle of treatment. Scores are reported on a 0-100 scale, where 100=better outcome QOL.

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 8 prior to each paclitaxel course, and then every 30 days for 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns within patient groups. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that is graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated&quot; or &quot;unlikely to be related&quot; to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing. The overall toxicity rates (percentages) for grade 3 or higher adverse events considered at least possibly related to treatment are reported below.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of EORTC Sensory, Autonomic, and Motor Neuropathy Subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of EORTC Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neurophathy Module (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) Sensory, Autonomic, and Motor Neuropathy Subscales. The EORTC CIPN20 scoring algorithm was used for the sensory (items 31-36, 39, 40 and 48), motor (items 37, 38, 41-45, 49), and autonomic (items 46, 47, 50) subscale scores on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores represent fewer symptoms (better QOL). The aAUCpa for each subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the 6-month assessment. For example; for each patient and each subscale, the subscale values at treatment-initiation and assessment-1 are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for that assessment time-period. Then these AUCs for all available assessment time-periods up to 6-months are averaged to yield the aAUCpa per patient per subcale.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of EORTC Sensory, Autonomic, and Motor Neuropathy Subscales</title>
        <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of EORTC Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neurophathy Module (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) Sensory, Autonomic, and Motor Neuropathy Subscales. The EORTC CIPN20 scoring algorithm was used for the sensory (items 31-36, 39, 40 and 48), motor (items 37, 38, 41-45, 49), and autonomic (items 46, 47, 50) subscale scores on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores represent fewer symptoms (better QOL). The aAUCpa for each subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the 6-month assessment. For example; for each patient and each subscale, the subscale values at treatment-initiation and assessment-1 are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for that assessment time-period. Then these AUCs for all available assessment time-periods up to 6-months are averaged to yield the aAUCpa per patient per subcale.</description>
