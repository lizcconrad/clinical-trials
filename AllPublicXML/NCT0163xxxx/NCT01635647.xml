  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prime boost vaccination with ChAd63 ME-TRAP followed eight weeks later with MVA ME-TRAP shows
      efficacy against malaria infection when tested in UK volunteers using sporozoite challenge
      experiments. It is a leading candidate vaccination strategy against malaria. In the field,
      Phase I studies have been conducted in adults in Kenya and The Gambia and children and
      infants in The Gambia. The vaccination strategy appears safe and well tolerated in these
      populations, and also shows impressive immunogenicity, not significantly different to that
      seen in the UK trials where efficacy was shown. In particular, recent data from The Gambia
      shows excellent safety and immunogenicity in infants in malaria endemic areas, who would be
      the ones to benefit most from such a vaccine against malaria. With this clinical development
      as background, the investigators now propose to evaluate efficacy against natural malaria
      infection in this important target group for an effective malaria vaccine, that is, 5-17
      month infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The proposed study area, Banfora,
      Burkina Faso, is highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
