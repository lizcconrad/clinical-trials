  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase Ib study that has six treatment arms is designed to assess the safety,
      pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; an engineered
      anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PDL1] antibody) administered with bevacizumab (Arm A) and
      with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFOX) (Arm B),
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm C), with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Arm D), with
      carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm E), and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm F) in participants with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study includes dose escalation cohort for
      establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and then
      expansion cohort will be initiated based on a selected dose level at or below the MTD or MAD.
