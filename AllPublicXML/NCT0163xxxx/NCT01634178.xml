  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of a high fat meal on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 30 mg of apremilast in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study. Each subject will be
      randomized to receive a single dose of 30 mg apremilast during each of the 2 periods; once
      under fasting conditions and once after a high fat meal. The subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive apremilast either fasted first, then fed, or fed first then fasted. The
      subjects will check into the study center on Day -1 of each period, will be dosed on Day 1,
      and discharged from the study center on Day 3 after all scheduled pharmacokinetic blood draws
      and safety evaluations. After a washout of at least 5 days to a maximum of 10 days, the
      subjects return for period 2 during which they will receive apremilast according to their
      assigned sequence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects of any ethnic origin between ages of 18 and 65
             inclusive with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 33.

          2. Females who are able to become pregnant have a negative pregnancy test at screening
             and baseline, and must agree to use one of the following:

               -  a highly effective form of contraception (ex. Non-oral hormonal, intrauterine
                  device) OR

               -  oral hormonal contraceptive plus one additional form of barrier contraception OR

               -  Two forms of barrier contraception These must be effective by the time of
                  screening.

          3. All other females must have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, or psychiatric
             illness, that would prevent the subject from signing the Informed Consent form, places
             the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the study, or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          2. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or plans to have elective or medical
             procedures during the conduct of the trial.

          3. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the
             first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known
             (whichever is longer).

          4. Subjects with known serum hepatitis, is a known carrier of hepatitis B surface
             antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus antibody.

          5. Subjects who have used prescription systemic or topical medications within 30 days of
             dosing, unless it is being used to treat a stable, chronic medical condition. This
             includes medication that is an inhibitor or inducer of P-glycoprotein transporter and
             CYP-3A4/5 used within 14 days of dosing.
