      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of the DeltaMotion cup system in the
      treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement.Patients who
      enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient,
      clinical and x-ray assessments.
