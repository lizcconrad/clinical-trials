  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to test the hypothesis whether a novel intervention that uses
      motivational interviewing along with immediate feedback and follow-up counseling calls is
      effective in educating the household members about the health hazards of smoking and
      secondhand smoke exposure and reducing children exposure to secondhand smoke at households in
      Armenia.

      The study was a randomized control trial with two arms: intervention and control groups.

      The sample population for the study included households with a non-smoking mother and at
      least one child 2 to 6 years of age residing with at least one daily smoker. The study team
      recruited the households through pediatrician's offices in polyclinics (primary healthcare
      facilities) utilizing multistage random sampling. Trained interviewers made two baseline (one
      week apart) and two 4-month follow-up household visits to conduct measurements, interviews
      and intervention. Measurements included surveys, air nicotine monitoring in homes and hair
      samples from children to assess changes in nicotine concentration over time.

      SHS concentration was estimated by sampling vapor-phase nicotine using a filter badge treated
      with sodium bisulfate. Airborne nicotine monitors were used in all homes to measure SHS
      concentration at baseline and 4 month follow-up. At least one monitor was used in each home,
      preferably in the main room in which the family congregates.

      Personal exposure to SHS in 2-6 years old children was assessed using biological samples of
      hair. A small sample of hair (approximately 30 - 50 strands, 2-3 cm) was cut near the hair
      root from the back of the scalp where there is the most uniform growth pattern between
      individuals which minimizes the variability of the results.

      The intervention included an in-person counseling session with distribution of a tailored
      educational brochure and demonstration/feedback measurement of indoor PM2.5 (at second
      baseline visit); it also included one and two months follow-up counseling calls. The control
      group received only a brief educational leaflet on the hazards of second-hand smoke exposure.

    <description>The interventionist provided in person counseling on eliminating child exposure to tobacco smoke to at least one daily smoker and a non-smoker mother in the household. The counseling session emphasized the following issues: a) importance of healthy environment at home, b) health dangers of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, c) why and how to quit smoking, and d) how to keep home air smoke-free.</description>

    <description>The study team measured the particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air using the TSI AM 510 Aerosol SidePak to compare the quality of indoor air with outdoor air and demonstrate the effect of smoking on indoor air quality in the intervention households. After completing the Side Pack PM2.5 measurement, the interventionist immediately downloaded the data to a laptop to visualize the results through graphical presentation of the PM2.5 fluctuations to family members.</description>

    <description>Interventionists made two follow-up counseling calls to the primary contact in the intervention households, usually a non-smoking mother at one and two months after the in-person counseling session. These calls aimed at a) assessing the progress in meeting the goals set earlier, b) counseling on barriers to the change, and c) encouraging study participants to maintain the success or to set new goals. These calls also provided opportunity for the participants to ask questions or clarify issues</description>
