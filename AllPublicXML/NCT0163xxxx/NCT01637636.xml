  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand whether there is any difference in the
      amount of tasimelteon (including its breakdown product) in the blood when taken alone and in
      combination with either rifampin or ketoconazole.

      Cytochrome P450 3A4 is an important enzyme produced by the body to breakdown certain
      medications. In this study, the effect that this important enzyme has on tasimelteon is being
      studied by assessing the effect rifampin and ketoconazole have on tasimelteon and how they
      are broken down by your body. Rifampin is a known inducer of Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme
      meaning that it increases the activity of the enzyme. Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of
      Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme meaning that it decreases the activity of the enzyme.

      In addition, the safety and tolerability of tasimelteon will also be assessed throughout the
      study.
