    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate safety,
      pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics (the
      effect of the investigated drug on the body) of NNC 0172-2021 administered subcutaneously to
      healthy male subjects and subjects with haemophilia.

      The present phase 1 trial has been terminated due to the need for changes in the trial design
      requiring a new re-designed multiple dosing phase 1 trial. Initiation of this new trial
      awaits additional non-clinical data.
