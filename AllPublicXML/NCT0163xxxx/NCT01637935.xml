      To assess the potential association between pioglitazone and bladder cancer compared with
      non-pioglitazone users among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Following guidance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European
      Medicines Agency, the University of Pennsylvania and Kaiser Permanente Northern California
      (KPNC) designed and conducted this study using the KPNC database to assess the potential
      association between pioglitazone and bladder cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

      The study was conducted over the course of 10 years, with a series of interim analyses
      undertaken during this period and provided to the sponsor (Takeda) and the appropriate
      regulatory agencies.

      In 2011, the planned 5-year interim analysis of this study was published in Diabetes Care.
      That report included data from 1 January 1997 to 30 April 2008. Following reporting of these
      data, there was a request from the FDA for an additional fourth interim analysis at 8 years
      including data from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2010.

      In August 2011 the FDA requested inclusion of a sensitivity analysis to assess change of
      cohort entry criteria to minimize left censoring of exposure. Included in the FDA request was
      a duration analysis for other antidiabetic medications.

      In August 2014, the final 10-year analyses were completed and submitted to the sponsor and
      regulatory agencies.

      Interim results previously posted on clinicaltrials.gov are available in the public archive

        The study was conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), which provides
        comprehensive healthcare services to approximately 3.2 million members. The source
        population was identified from the KPNC diabetes registry, which was first constructed in
        1993 and has been updated annually since then. The registry identifies patients primarily
        from four data sources: primary hospital discharge diagnoses of diabetes mellitus (since
        1971); two or more outpatient visit diagnoses of diabetes (since 1995); any prescription
        for a diabetes-related medication (since 1994); or any record of an abnormal hemoglobin A1c
        (HbA1c) test (&gt;6.7%) (since 1991).

        The diabetes registry gathers data from a variety of KPNC electronic medical records (EMR)
        to build and follow the registry cohort across time. These data include cancer registries,
        pharmacy records, laboratory records, and inpatient and outpatient medical diagnoses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study cohort included both patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes
             mellitus prior to January 1, 1997 and those who were newly diagnosed prior to December
             31, 2002. Patients were eligible for the study cohort if they met any of the following
             criteria:

               1. As of January 1, 1997 they had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, were age 40
                  or older and were members of KPNC,

               2. They had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, reached age 40 between January 1,
                  1997 and December 31, 2002 and were KPNC members on their 40th birthday, or

               3. Had diabetes mellitus and were age 40 or older when they joined KPNC between
                  January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2002.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of bladder cancer recorded in the KPNC cancer registry prior to entry to the
             cohort or within 6 months of entry into KPNC.
