      The aims of the study were to attempt to answer the following questions; what proportion of
      women know how to and are able to exercise their pelvic floor and for those who cannot can
      they be trained and motivated to do so. This was a nested design comprising a prospective
      cohort study together with a controlled trial intervention after baseline assessment in the
      cohort study for a defined at-risk group.

    <description>Women in both the practice nurse and specialist nurse groups were given supervised pelvic floor exercise training. After the initial training they were given a daily exercise regimen and seen at monthly intervals for three months. The practice nurses had attended a study day on supervising Pelvic Floor Muscle Training(PFMT)followed by practice sessions with patients overseen by the nurse specialist.</description>
