    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study to determine the effects of an activated vitamin D compound
      (paricalcitol) on heart structure (size) and function (ability to relax) in patients with
      normal kidney function and a form of heart failure known as HFPEF (heart failure and
      preserved ejection fraction). This study will also examine heart failure-related
      hospitalizations and changes in cardiac-stretch and biological markers that are believed to
      change along with heart size. Patients in this pilot study will be treated for a period of 48
      weeks with paricalcitol at a dose previously approved by FDA (1 mcg per day) and followed-up
      for 4 weeks after treatment is completed.

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is among the top ten causes of hospitalizations in the US. It is estimated
      that ~40-50% of patients with HF have preserved ejection fraction (EF). Patients with heart
      failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) have normal systolic function, but impaired
      cardiac relaxation. The main causes of HFPEF include left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and
      hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis with a normal EF, coronary artery
      disease and restrictive cardiomyopathies.

      Only a few small clinical trials have tested therapeutic interventions in patients with
      HFPEF, producing either small or negative effects. Relatively few drugs have effects on
      cardiac relaxation and are not candidates for chronic use, as they may have significant side
      effect profiles and/or are inconvenient to administer. Paricalcitol, an FDA-approved
      activated form of vitamin D, has been shown to slow LVH progression and improve parameters
      associated with diastolic function in animal models (see refs). Treatment with paricalcitol
      has also been associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a
      historical cohort study of patients with end-stage renal disease (see refs).

      This is a single-center, single-arm, pilot study in 20 patients with HFPEF and normal renal
      function on stable medical therapy to evaluate the effects of paricalcitol on cardiac
      structure and function.
