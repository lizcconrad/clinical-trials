      The purpose of the research is to collect and examine spinal disc and ligament tissues to see
      if there are any biological markers that can be correlated with MRI images to help us learn
      more about causes of back pain. Spinal discs are the pillow-like cushions between the bones
      of the spine. They act as shock-absorbers for the spine. Spinal ligaments support the disc
      structure during movement.

      Degenerative disc disease is the most prevalent indication for spine surgery and the major
      source of back pain in afflicted patients. Age related degeneration of the intervertebral
      discs is not the exception, but the rule. Degenerative changes are associated with weakening
      of the disc and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum in the spine. The aim of this study is
      to determine if there are any local or systemic biomarkers that correlate with the severity
      of degeneration as indicated by radiological examination. To date, Imaging (XRay, MRI, CT
      scans) are the most widely used diagnostic tools for identifying degenerated discs. Physical
      changes in the disc are also associated with increased secretion and expression of
      inflammatory mediators in the tissue. The investigators are interested in measuring both gene
      and protein level changes of inflammatory mediators in degenerated discs in order to
      correlate these levels with imaging based indicators of degeneration. Protein level changes
      in the disc and ligamentum flavum have yet to be correlated with MRI-derived disc modic
      changes classification system. The investigators hypothesize that as the image
      characteristics of advancing degenerative disease increase, a corresponding change will be
      present in the secretion (or expression) of specific markers related to inflammatory
      processes in the disc. Cytokines found to be upregulated in disc tissue or ligamentum flavum
      will also be measured in patient's serum levels to begin developing a systemic diagnostic
      method for detecting disc degeneration.
