        1. Conventional Physical Therapy.

        2. Physical Therapy focused on healthy lifestyle using the &quot;Stage of Change&quot; model.

      Non-dependent observer will follow-up on the outcome parameters via phone calls and filling
      the questionnaire's with the relevant study participants following 3 months, 1 year, 2 and 5
      years.
