    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determined if a lower back treatment would change the hip and
      knee muscle activities in people with and without anterior knee pain. The investigators
      hypothesized that the lower back treatment may change the hip and knee muscle activities in
      people with anterior knee pain but not in people without anterior knee pain.

    <measure>Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be assessed before and 45 min after the lower back treatment (lumbopelvic manipulation) for participants in the patellofemoral pain syndrome group on Day 2 only.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a 100 mm continuous line between two end-points. The left end-point represents &quot;no pain&quot; and the right end-point represents the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

          2. pain with patellar facet palpation or compression

          3. subjective knee pain rating of at least 3/10 on the pain visual analog scale during at
             least one of the following activities:

               -  ascending stair

               -  descending stair

               -  kneeling

               -  squatting

               -  running

               -  jumping

               -  prolong sitting for more than 20 minutes

        Exclusion criteria for all participants:

          1. history of spine, hip or knee surgery

          2. history of hip pathology or other knee condition

          3. current significant injury of any lower extremity joints

          4. pregnancy

          5. sign of nerve root compression

          6. osteoporosis or history of compression fracture

        Age- and gender- matched control participants will be recruited if they have no signs or
