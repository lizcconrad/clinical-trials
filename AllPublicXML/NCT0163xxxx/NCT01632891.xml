  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if antiretroviral therapy (ART) is safe and works at
      getting rid of malaria in blood and to see whether one type of ART is better than another.
      This study may offer information for further research in looking at whether ART plays a role
      in the prevention and treatment of malaria.

             DAIDS-approved laboratory.

          -  Pf SCP confirmed in a laboratory approved to conduct parasitemia microscopy.

        Note: Pf SCP will be defined as meeting all three of the following criteria within 72 hours
        prior to study entry:

          -  Microscopy confirmed parasitemia (see section 6.3.6 and the A5297 Manual of Procedures
             [MOPS])

          -  An oral temperature &lt; 37.5°C temperature

          -  The absence of Grade 2 or greater signs or symptoms thought to be related to clinical
             malaria including:

               1. headache

               2. malaise or fatigue

               3. abdominal discomfort

               4. muscle or joint pain

               5. fever

               6. chills

               7. perspiration

               8. anorexia

               9. vomiting

              10. other signs or symptoms thought to be related to clinical malaria

          -  Certain laboratory values obtained within 14 days prior to study entry, as detailed in
             section 4.1.4 of the protocol.

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative within 30 days prior to entry.

          -  Female study volunteers of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to entry.

        NOTE: Female study volunteers of reproductive potential are defined as women who have
        reached menarche or who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months
        {i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months and have not undergone a
        sterilization procedure (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingectomy)}.

          -  Female study volunteers of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to entry.

        NOTE: Female study volunteers of reproductive potential are defined as women who have
        reached menarche or who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months
        {i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months and have not undergone a
        sterilization procedure (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingectomy)}.

          -  All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (eg, active
             attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization)
             for study duration.

        If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all study volunteers must
        agree to use two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while receiving
        protocol-specified medications. One form of contraceptive must be a barrier method if a
        participant receives EFV. Participants must agree to continue the use of two contraceptives
        for 6 months after stopping EFV and 6 weeks after stopping all other protocol-specified
        medications.

        Note: Female participants who are unable to meet the contraception requirements for EFV
        should be encouraged to consider NVP.

          -  Study volunteers who are not of reproductive potential (girls who have not reached
             menarche, or women who have been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months,
             or women who have undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy, or
             men who have documented azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of a
             contraceptive. Acceptable documentation of sterilization, other contraceptive methods,
             and menopause are written documentation or oral communication from a clinician or
             clinician's staff documented in source documents of one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record

               -  Discharge summary

               -  Laboratory report of azoospermia (is required to document successful vasectomy)

               -  FSH measurement elevated into the menopausal range as established by the
                  reporting laboratory for EFV and per participant's history for all other drugs.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent.

          -  Willing and able to return to the clinic twice to three times a day for study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Step 1: Exclusion Criteria

          -  Previous history or current use of ART.

          -  Single dose NVP or dual therapies used for PMTCT within 2 years prior to entry.

          -  Use of any medication with antimalarial activity, including TMP/SMX (see list of
             prohibited medications in the A5297 MOPS), within 14 days prior to study entry.

          -  Confirmed or clinically suspected OIs (including but not limited to tuberculosis,
             clinical malaria, PCP), or other pulmonary or gastrointestinal infections for which
             potential participants did not complete treatment more than 30 days prior to
             enrollment or have signs and symptoms during screening.

          -  Breastfeeding.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or
             their formulation.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days
             prior to entry.

          -  Results suggestive of active pulmonary disease from a chest x-ray performed within 30
             days prior to study entry.
