      The investigators are trying to evaluate the clinical effect of remote ischemic
      postconditioning on liver graft function and postoperative renal function in subjects
      undergoing living-donor liver transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic reperfusion injury of liver graft and postoperative renal dysfunction is a common
      problem which influence poor outcome in subjects undergoing liver transplantation. The
      incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction was reported as high as 12 ~ 64% and is thought
      to be caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Ischemic pre- or postconditioning was reported
      to be effective for preventing ischemia/reperfusion injury during liver transplantation.
      Remote ischemic pre- or postconditioning was also reported to be protective for
      ischemia/reperfusion injury in major organs in previous animal studies. Therefore, we are
      trying to evaluate the clinical effect of remote ischemic postconditioning on liver graft
      function and postoperative renal function in subjects undergoing living-donor liver
      transplantation.

Remote ischemic postconditioning consists of three 5-min cycles of upper limb ischemia, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the unilateral upper limb and inflated to 250 mm Hg, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff was deflated.</description>
