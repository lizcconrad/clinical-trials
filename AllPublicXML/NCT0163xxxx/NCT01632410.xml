      The study describes the autonomic control system function in subjects post stroke in
      comparison with healthy subjects.

      Aims: To describe the Autonomic hart rate control system function in post stroke subjects in
      different rehabilitation levels in comparison with healthy subjects.

      To examine the reflective reaction of the autonomic control system as reflected in the heart
      rate variability to stimulations subjects in different rehabilitation levels in comparison
      with healthy subjects.

      To examine the autonomic control system reaction as reflected in the heart rate variability
      to physical and cognitive action subjects in different rehabilitation levels in comparison
      with healthy subjects.

      Subjects will be examined 3 times: a week 1 and 3 month post stroke. Control consist similar
      in description healthy subjects, will be examined once. Each test includes 24 hours Holter
      surveillance and an examine that include general check that reflects the autonomic reaction
      to different manipulation.

      The examination description:

      A. Prior to the examination subjects will be asked to fill the mRS, NIHSS forms.

      B. Subjects will receive an examination that includes

        -  General neurological examination (strength, deep and superficial sensation, cognitive
           test and pain level.) C. Holter will be place for 24 hours. And autonomic examination
           test will be conducted

        -  Grip Test: emphases the sympathetic system.

        -  Breathing Test: emphases the parasympathetic system. D. Manipulation to examine the two
           sub systems. Each manipulation lasts1 minute.
