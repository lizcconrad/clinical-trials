      The purpose of this study is to see how the brain differs between smoking regularly and after
      not smoking for 24 hours. The investigators will be using an MRI machine to get the
      information from adult smokers and non-smokers while they lie in the scanner with their eyes
      closed. Smokers will be scanned when they have not smoked for 24 hrs and shortly after
      smoking. It is our hypothesis that brain activity will be altered after not smoking for 24
      hours.

      The broad objective of this proposal is to identify functional neuroanatomical correlates of
      changes in brain functional connectivity during smoking abstinence. The investigators will
      measure changes in regional blood oxygenation levels using fMRI while adult smokers and
      non-smokers lie in the scanner with their eyes closed. Smokers will be scanned when they are
      abstinent from smoking for 24 hrs and shortly after smoking. Our primary hypothesis is that
      smoking abstinence will alter resting state brain activity (or resting state functional
      connectivity; RSFC) across widely distributed neural networks and that high-resolution fMRI
      will help in resolving the exact nature of such changes. Data will be analyzed using methods
      developed in our laboratory and applied to other resting state datasets. All of the
      procedures used in the study are well validated and introduce only minor risk to participants
      (e.g. blood draw; MRI).
