      Introduction - Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (AF) ablation. Recurrences remain, however, not infrequent and are mainly due to
      PVs reconnection. In this setting, all procedural means able to improve the quality of tissue
      lesions are welcome.

      Study Hypothesis - A continuous sensing of contact force (CF) during ablation, offered by a
      new catheter available on the market, was a valuable additional tool increasing the efficacy
      of the ablation procedure for PVI.

      Methods - Prospective observational non-randomized monocentric study. Patients with
      paroxysmal AF receive PVI following standard ablation procedures (linear antral catheter
      ablation guided by CARTO 3 System, Biosense Webster, Inc.) using either a new irrigated RF
      ablation catheter that provides tip-to-tissue CF information (THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter,
      Biosense Webster, Inc.) (CF group), or a non-CF irrigated catheter (THERMOCOOL SF or EZ STEER
      THERMOCOOL Catheter, Biosense Webster, Inc.) (control group). Overall, 60 consecutive
      patients are enrolled in the study, with 30 patients in each group. All procedures is
      performed by the same experienced operator, not blinded to the catheter used. Except for CF
      information (with an objective of at least 10 g, associated to the most perpendicular vector
      obtainable), ablation procedures are carried out using identical approaches in both groups.
      Patients are discharged from hospital free of antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients are enrolled
      in a specific follow-up plan.

      Primary Endpoints -(1) Proportion of PVI after exclusive anatomic approach, (2) Proportion of
      patients free of AF after 12-month follow-up.
