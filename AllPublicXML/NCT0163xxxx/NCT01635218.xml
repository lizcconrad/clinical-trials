    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine whether individualized homeopathic treatment and
      fluoxetine are more efficient than placebo for moderate to severe depression in peri- and
      postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perimenopausal period is characterized by an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Major
      depression is one of the most disabling medical conditions worldwide. At present, it is
      becoming more difficult to prove that antidepressants actually work better than placebo in
      clinical trials.Use of homeopathy to treat depression is widespread, but there is a lack of
      clinical trails about its efficacy in depression in peri- and postmenopausal women. Previous
      trials suggest that individualized homeopathic treatments improve depression in general
      population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individualized homeopathic
      treatment and fluoxetine are more efficient than placebo for moderate depression in peri- and
      postmenopausal women.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at 6 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) is a well-known standardized scale used worldwide to assess severity of depression. Score ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (maximum depression severity). A total score in HRSD was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. For this study the change was calculated as the later time point (total score in 17- HRSD at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score at baseline). A score &lt; or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), &gt; 24 (severe depression).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that assess severity of depression. A total score range was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. A score 0 (without depression) up to 63 (most severe depression). For this study the change was calculated as the later time point (total score in BDI at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score in BDI at baseline). A score 0 - 8 is considered normal, 9 - 18 (mild to moderate depression), 19 - 28 (moderate to severe depression), &gt; 29 (severe depression).</description>

A score &lt; or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), &gt; 24 (severe depression). Responder rate definition: a decrease of 50% or more from baseline score using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression after six weeks treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Greene´s Scale at 6 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Greene Climacteric Scale (GS) is intended to be a standard measure of core climacteric symptoms. For this study a total range was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. A total score 0 (without climacteric symptoms) up to 63 (most severe climacteric symptoms). The change was calculated as the later time point (total score in GS at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score at baseline).The scale measures four separate sub-scales (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and sexual function). The score of the four sub-scales was summed. A total score of 0 -10 is considered without symptoms, 11 - 29 (mild symptoms), 30 - 49 (moderate symptoms) and &gt; 50 (severe symptoms).</description>

          <description>Greene Climacteric Scale is intended to be a standard measure of core climacteric symptoms. For this study a total range was assessed: 0 (without climacteric symptoms) up to 63 (most severe climacteric symptoms). The scale measures four separate sub-scales (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and sexual function). The score of the four sub-scales was summed. A total score of 0 -10 is considered without symptoms, 11 - 29 (mild symptoms), 30 - 49 (moderate symptoms) and &gt; 50 (severe symptoms).
The score presented here is the baseline score of Greene Climacteric Scale before treatment.</description>

        <description>17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) is a well-known standardized scale used worldwide to assess severity of depression. Score ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (maximum depression severity). A total score in HRSD was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. For this study the change was calculated as the later time point (total score in 17- HRSD at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score at baseline). A score &lt; or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), &gt; 24 (severe depression).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Beck Depression Inventory at 6 Weeks.</title>
        <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that assess severity of depression. A total score range was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. A score 0 (without depression) up to 63 (most severe depression). For this study the change was calculated as the later time point (total score in BDI at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score in BDI at baseline). A score 0 - 8 is considered normal, 9 - 18 (mild to moderate depression), 19 - 28 (moderate to severe depression), &gt; 29 (severe depression).</description>

        <description>Greene Climacteric Scale (GS) is intended to be a standard measure of core climacteric symptoms. For this study a total range was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. A total score 0 (without climacteric symptoms) up to 63 (most severe climacteric symptoms). The change was calculated as the later time point (total score in GS at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score at baseline).The scale measures four separate sub-scales (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and sexual function). The score of the four sub-scales was summed. A total score of 0 -10 is considered without symptoms, 11 - 29 (mild symptoms), 30 - 49 (moderate symptoms) and &gt; 50 (severe symptoms).</description>

        <description>17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a well-known standardized scale used worldwide to assess severity of depression. Score ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (maximum depression severity). A total score in 17-item Hamilton Scale for Depression was assessed for this study. It ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (most severe depression). A score &lt; or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), &gt; 24 (severe depression). Remission rate definition: 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score &lt; 7 points after 6 weeks of treatment.</description>
