  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine use disorders are an unrelenting public health concern. Intensive research efforts
      have yielded behavioral interventions that reduce cocaine use, however, these interventions
      are not universally effective and treatment effects diminish over time. Development of a
      pharmacotherapy that enhances the efficacy of these interventions is a priority for the
      National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study proposes to determine the impact of buspirone
      maintenance on self-administration of cocaine and alternative reinforcers. These preliminary
      data will be used to support further research developing buspirone as a pharmacotherapy for
      cocaine use disorders. We hypothesize that buspirone will attenuate the reinforcing effects
      of cocaine and increase the reinforcing effects of alternative reinforcers.

    <measure>Number of Times Cocaine Was Selected in the Presence of a Monetary Reward Alternative</measure>
    <time_frame>One test per cocaine dose level per intervention for each participant over his/her 2 week inpatient admission</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of cocaine were determined using a modified progressive ratio procedure (Stoops et al., 2010) in which subjects made 6 choices between available each available cocaine dose and money (US$0.25). Reinforcing effects are measured for each cocaine dose during both buspirone and placebo maintenance.</description>

    <measure>Peak Score on Sedative Subscale of the Adjective Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects completed this measure at 15 minute intervals for 45 minutes after sampling each cocaine dose under both buspirone and placebo maintenance conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed 16 items that loaded into the Sedative Subscale of the Adjective Rating Scale. The items were rated 0-4 on a Likert-type scale and the sum for the 16 &quot;sedative&quot; items was summed to yield the Sedative Subscale score. The maximum score for this scale was 64, the minimum was 0. Higher values represent greater subjective effects on this item. Peak scores were calculated from multiple assessments for each cocaine dose under both buspirone and placebo conditions.</description>
