  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 25% medicines prescribed for long term conditions are not taken as directed, and
      approximately 15% people receiving a new medicine take few, if any, doses. The New Medicine
      Service (NMS) is a community pharmacy service that started in England in October 2011 which
      involves the pharmacist providing additional support to patients starting a new medicine for
      some breathing problems (asthma &amp; COPD), high blood pressure, adult onset diabetes or
      medicines which reduce blood clotting. It aims to improve the way patients take their
      medicines improving outcomes and reducing costs to the National Health Service (NHS).

      The investigators will assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the NMS using a
      research study where some people will receive the NMS, and some won't, so The investigators
      can look at the effect of the NMS on problems with their medicines, medicines taking and use
      of the NHS in general. Data will be collected in the East Midlands, South Yorkshire and
      London areas.

      The investigators will recruit 500 patients from a range of different pharmacies and follow
      them up at six, ten and twenty six weeks after starting their new medicine to assess effects
      on medicines taking behaviour, patients' reported problems with medicines, referrals to their
      General Practitioner (GP) and use of NHS resources. The investigators will compare the data
      gathered from this study with that being collected routinely by all pharmacies in England to
      provide wider estimates of cost effectiveness.

      The investigators will also explore how the NMS service is being implemented by pharmacies. A
      sample of patients from the main study will be followed in more detail. This will involve
      recording the consultations with the pharmacist and also interviewing patients about their
      experience of the service. The investigators will interview the patients GP to investigate
      their views of the service. The investigators will also try to understand why people decline
      the invitation for the NMS
