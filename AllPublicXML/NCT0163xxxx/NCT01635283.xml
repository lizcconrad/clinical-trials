    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase II clinical trial is to determine the safety and effect on
      survival of patients autologous dendritic cells pulsed with autologous tumor lysate as a
      treatment for low-grade glioma patients. Other goals of this study are to determine if the
      vaccine can cause an immune response against patients' cancer cells and slow the growth of
      their brain tumors

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), using intradermal injections of
      autologous dendritic cells harvested from peripheral blood precursors and pulsed
      (co-cultured) with tumor lysate derived from surgical tissues in patients with low-grade
      gliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor overall survival (OS), and cellular immune responses in brain tumor patients
      injected with tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on
      days 0, 14, and 28.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma of World Health Organization (WHO)
             grade II (astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and/or oligoastrocytoma) will be eligible
             for this protocol

          -  Patients must have had surgical resection at University of California, Los Angeles
             (UCLA), for which a separate informed consent was signed for the collection of their
             tumor prior to surgery

          -  After surgery, a pathological diagnosis of low-grade glioma (WHO grade II) will need
             to be established

          -  Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document; patients
             must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational
             nature of this study.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) rating of &gt;= 60 prior to
             initiating treatment; patients may be enrolled at a KPS of &lt; 60 if it is felt that the
             patient will have adequate opportunity to recover to a KPS of &gt;= 60 by the initiation
             of treatment

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm%

          -  Absolute granulocyte count &gt;= 1,500

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100K

          -  Serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             (SGOT) =&lt; 2.5 times institutional normals

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5mg%

          -  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times institutional normals

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with an active infection

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent because of psychiatric or complicating medical
             problems

          -  Unstable or severe intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions as determined by the
             Investigator

             approved contraception

          -  History of immunodeficiency (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) or autoimmune
             disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis,
             polymyositis-dermatomyositis, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, or juvenile-onset
             insulin-dependent diabetes) that may be exacerbated by immunotherapy

          -  Subjects with organ allografts

          -  Inability or unwillingness to return for required visits and follow-up exams

          -  Subjects who have an uncontrolled systemic malignancy that is not in remission
