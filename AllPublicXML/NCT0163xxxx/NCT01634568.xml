      A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending oral doses of V81444 in healthy male
      volunteers

      Part A - Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single
      ascending dose study.

      Each study subject will participate in a screen visit, three identical treatment periods, in
      each of which they will receive a single oral dose of V81444 or placebo in accord-ance with
      the randomisation schedule, and one post-study visit.

      In each treatment period, subjects will be admitted the day before dosing (Day -1) and,
      subject to satisfactory medical review, discharged in the morning, 4 days later (Day 4).

      Part B - Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, multiple ascending dose study

      Each study subject will participate in a screen visit, one treatment period in which they
      will receive repeated oral doses of V81444 or placebo in accordance with the randomisation
      schedule, and one post-study visit.

      In each treatment period, subjects will be admitted the day before dosing (Day -1), dosed
      daily on Days 1 to 14 and, subject to satisfactory medical review, will be discharged in the
      morning, 3 days after the final dose (Day 17).
