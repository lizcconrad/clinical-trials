  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to use MRI to evaluate pre- and post-arthroplasty hips; the specific
      aims of this project are three-fold. First, the investigators intend to compare the amount of
      muscle atrophy and tendon damage that occurs around the hip between two commonly-used
      operative approaches: the direct-anterior approach and the posterior approach. Second, the
      investigators aim to provide baseline data on the amount of muscle atrophy and tendon damage
      that should reasonably be expected to occur with both of these approaches. Third, the
      investigators will document the degree of recovery of the periprosthetic soft tissues
      post-surgery in both patient groups.

      The investigators first hypothesis is that the posterior approach will demonstrate
      significantly more damage to the abductors, piriformis, and short external rotators than the
      direct anterior approach, which will demonstrate minimal soft tissue damage. The
      investigators second hypothesis is that both surgical approaches will cause some degree of
      baseline muscle damage and atrophy, in a predictable pattern. The investigators third
      hypothesis is that each of the surgical approaches inherently cause some degree of soft
      tissue damage, and that the periprosthetic soft tissues that are incised during the surgical
      exposure will recover in a predictable pattern which is consistent but unique within each
      group
