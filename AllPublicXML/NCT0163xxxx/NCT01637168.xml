    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different drugs in
      the treatment of patients diagnosed with memory difficulties and a decline in cognitive
      function.

      This is a parallel distribution: a group of patients will be treated with a combination Panax
      Ginseng + Ginkgo Biloba + multivitamin + Polyminerals (EMS), and another group with Ginkgo
      Biloba (Tebonin ®).
