  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few breast cancer support groups that focus on the specific needs of Chinese women.
      The purpose of this study is to learn about two different ways of providing support groups to
      help women of Chinese descent cope with the difficulties of a diagnosis of breast cancer and
      its treatment. The investigators want to learn about how best to support Chinese women with
      breast cancer by providing two different types of groups: an in-person support group and a
      virtual (online/phone) support group.

    <description>To pilot and evaluate the feasibility of information-based, culturally-tailored in-person and virtual support groups for Chinese patients with breast cancer. The feasibility of participation in the in-person and virtual support groups will be measured by documenting patient accrual to the pilot study and attendance at the support groups.</description>

    <description>in the in-person versus virtual support groups on quality of life (QOL), pain, psychosocial outcomes (distress, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy in coping with cancer), and perceived social support.

    <description>All participants will complete the Brief Support Group Survey at the end of each support meeting to assess satisfaction with and to provide feedback on the usefulness of the meeting and the information presented, ease of understanding and cultural appropriateness of the information, effectiveness of the facilitator, and suggestions for change or improvement.</description>

The Screening Tool will be used for all eligible patients (patients refusing to participate will still be asked to complete the screening tool).</description>
