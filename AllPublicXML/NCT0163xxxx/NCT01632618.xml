  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the most frequently reported musculoskeletal problem and third most
      frequently reported symptom of any kind in people over the age of 75. In fact, 17.3% of all
      visits to physicians for LBP involve individuals over 65. In older adults, LBP has been
      associated with a host of negative consequences, including decreased physical function,
      increased fall risk, increased mood disturbance and increased health care utilization.
      Surprisingly, little research has focused on LBP in people over 65. But, recent evidence
      demonstrates that LBP is associated with increased intramuscular fat infiltration in the
      abdominal and paraspinal muscles and that this altered muscle composition increases the risk
      of mobility-related functional decline in older adults. While trunk muscle training (TMT) has
      been used in younger LBP groups, it is unproven in elders and, alone may not be sufficient to
      substantially improve function and symptoms, given the compromised state of ages muscle. TMT
      augmented with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) known to improve strength and
      function beyond the capacity of volitional exercise alone, may provide greater improvements.
      Treatment of chronic LBP in older adults using an exercise intervention has been hypothesized
      as a way to prevent functional decline and frailty progression; however this hypothesis has
      yet to be experimentally confirmed. In this exploratory study, the investigators will test
      the hypothesis that TMT plus NMES will result in reduced disability and pain severity
      compared to usual care in elders with chronic LBP.

        Inclusion Criteria: 64 participants &gt; age 65 will be recruited to participate. Participants
        will be included if they meet the following criteria:

        - Low Back Pain for at least 3 months with pain of at least moderate intensity every day or
        almost every day that requires activity modification. This criterion is necessary to
        guarantee a subject population that has chronic pain that is not controlled with
        conventional therapy. At least moderate pain intensity (&gt; 3 on a scale of 0-10) will be
        required to ensure our ability to detect treatment effects, and because pain of moderate
        intensity has been shown to be significant in the pain literature.11 The Pain thermometer
        has been shown to be reliable in older adults12, 13, will be used to screen pain intensity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion Criteria: Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following
             exist:

               -  Prominent component of radicular pain: CLBP with distal radiation below the knee

               -  Known spinal pathology other than osteoarthritis: (e.g., a history of back
                  surgery or recent trauma, spinal stenosis, vertebral compression fractures,
                  ankylosing spondylitis, carcinoma metastatic to the spine) In these other cases,
                  LBP may be of non-mechanical origin.

               -  Non-ambulatory, or severely impaired mobility (i.e., require the use of a
                  walker): Since measurement of physical performance in the proposed study includes
                  gait velocity and standing balance, conditions other than LBP that could
                  negatively impact these measures may confound our study results.

               -  Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score of &lt; 24 will exclude subjects
                  because of the uncertain reliability of their answers to the self-reported
                  outcome measures.

               -  Severe visual or hearing impairment: Since this study will involve questionnaires
                  and telephone evaluations, severe visual and/or hearing impairments may interfere
                  with data collection.

               -  Red flags indicative of a serious disorder underlying the LBP: Red flags that
                  would require specialized medical attention include fever, significant
                  unintentional weight loss, a sudden recent change in the character or intensity
                  of pain, trauma that preceded the onset of pain, or signs and symptoms of caudae
                  equinae. These subjects will be promptly referred to their primary practitioners.

               -  Significant pain in parts of the body other than the back or acute LBP: Since we
                  will be specifically evaluating chronic LBP, we do not want to confound the
                  outcome data with pain from other areas or with acute pain. Thus only subjects
                  with LBP severity that is greater than pain severity elsewhere in the body will
                  be included.

               -  Acute or terminal illness: To insure weekly participation and a six month
                  follow-up, subjects with an acute or terminal illness will be excluded from the
                  study.

               -  Presence of a pacemaker: Since electrical stimulation will be used in this study
                  and the effects of that stimulation on pacemakers is unknown, we will be cautious
                  and exclude subjects with this device.
