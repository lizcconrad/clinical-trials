      A feasibility study for the treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma of the lower extremities in the
      elderly utilizing intralesional cryosurgery.

      10 cases of BCC (confirmed by biopsy) in the lower extremity of elderly will undergo
      intralesional cryotherapy. A Cryoneedle is introduced through the skin lesion (BCC) and thus
      the BCC is frozen. Treatment success will be determined according to biopsy results 3 months
      after treatment

      BCC is the most common skin cancer. Many treatment modalities are acceptable including
      cryotherapy - freezing of the skin lesion with liquid nitrogen. This method is highly
      effective for the treatment of BCC. The purpose of this study is to determine the cure rates
      of BCC utilizing intralesional cryotherapy.

      surgery in the gold standard for the treatment of BCC, however in the case of skin malignancy
      in the elderly and in the lower extremity, surgical complication (including skin grafting)
      are high. Therefore cryotherapy which is a non surgical treatment method provides an optimal
      therapeutic choice.

      10 cases of BCC (confirmed by biopsy) in the lower extremity of elderly will undergo
      intralesional cryotherapy. A Cryoneedle is introduced through the skin lesion and the BCC is
      frozen. Treatment success will be determined according to biopsy results 3 months after
      treatment. Participants will be followed at the out patient clinic for the duration of wound
      healing, an expected average duration of 3 weeks.

    <description>The Intralesional cryotherapy technology (CryoShape; CryoShape™, U.S Patent Number 6,503,246; European Patent Number 1299043, FDA 510(k) Number K060928) had been developed for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The cryoneedle is connected by an adaptor to a cryogun filled with liquid nitrogen, and is introduced into the BCC. After the BCC is completely frozen, the cryoprobe defrosts and is withdrawn.
Other relevant intervention: The cryotherapy will be performed under local anesthesia (bupivacaine). After the procedure topical antibiotic cream will be applied. Participants will be followed at the out patient clinic for an average duration of 5 month after cryotherapy (3 month post cyotherapy until the biopsy and then 1-2 month more until biopsy results are received).</description>
