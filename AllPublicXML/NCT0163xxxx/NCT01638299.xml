      This study is a non-randomized, uncontrolled feasibility study that looks to enroll people
      with type 1 diabetes who are currently using an insulin pump. During the subject's
      participation, the study staff will closely monitor the study subject in a clinical research
      center environment for approximately 30 hours, while controller algorithm determined insulin
      doses are delivered by an insulin pump, and utilizing continuous glucose monitoring results.
