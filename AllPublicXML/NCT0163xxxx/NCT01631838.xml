  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to address the anti-thrombotic effects of tocotrienols
      supplementation via modulation of platelet activation, thrombotic markers, inflammatory
      markers and endothelial function.

      It is hypothesized that 2 weeks supplementation of tocotrienols will be able to suppress
      platelet aggregation in subjects with metabolic syndrome.

    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, crossover study comparing the effects of tocotrienols vs. placebo
      will be conducted in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Subjects will be supplemented with
      Tocovid Suprabio 200 mg twice daily (or placebo) for 2 weeks followed by a postprandial
      challenge on Day 14. During the postprandial challenge, venous blood samples will be
      collected during fasting. Subjects are then required to consume a high fat breakfast meal
      containing 50g fat and 100mL milkshake, followed by the assigned capsules. Venous blood
      samples will be drawn at 2, 4 and 6 hours after consumption of capsules. A washout period of
      at least 14 days will be in place before the commencement of the second treatment.
