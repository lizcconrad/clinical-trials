  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical studies will analyze the interactions between nicotine, alterations in
      endocrine hormones, mood and cardiovascular measures. They also intend to examine the
      contribution of gender and menstrual cycle phase. These studies hypothesize that this novel
      focus on nicotine's rapid hormonal, cardiovascular and subjective effects will be important
      for developing novel biologic approaches to treatment for nicotine abuse and dependence as
      well as advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine reinforcement.

      Clinical studies are proposed to measure the covariance between nicotine-induced changes in
      endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with increases
      in serum nicotine and cotinine levels. Possible gender and menstrual cycle phase influences
      on the effects of nicotine on HPA and HPG hormones have not been clearly delineated.
      Accordingly, we propose to compare the acute effects of nicotine in men and women, and to
      study women at the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.

    <description>Two doses of nicotine will be utilized: a commercially available, high-yield nicotine cigarette (Marlboro Red; Phillip Morris brand) and a denicotinized cigarette (Murty Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lexington, KY). The high dose cigarettes contain 15.48 mg of nicotine and 16 mg of tar based on analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH, 1998). The low nicotine cigarettes contain 1.1 mg of nicotine and deliver 0.1 mg of nicotine and 2.8 mg of tar based on analyses provided by the manufacturer.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15 cigarettes every
             day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence (305.10) will
             be eligible for participation.

          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and
             physical examination by a qualified physician.

          -  Absence of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders other than nicotine dependence (305.10) as measured
             by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID).

          -  Routine laboratory blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN and
             creatinine, liver function test, hepatitis panel and urinalysis will be performed.
             Laboratory parameters must be within the normal range. HBsAg must be negative but
             study participants who have hepatitis serology consistent with previous exposure to
             Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C, but who do not have clinical and biochemical
             evidence of acute infection, will be acceptable.

          -  Hematocrit levels â‰¥ 35%.

          -  Serum pregnancy test (hCG beta subunit) results must be negative within 24 hrs of the
             study day.

          -  Normal ECG.

          -  A mean Body Mass Index (ratio of weight (W) to height (H) squared; W/H2=kg/m2) will be
             calculated. Women with a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0-27.0 will be
             accepted.

          -  Study participants must be able to read, understand instructions and provide a valid
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with any lifetime DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than nicotine dependence will be
             excluded.

          -  Women who are pregnant as determined by laboratory testing for serum beta hCG will be
             excluded.

          -  Women who use hormonal contraceptive medications will not be accepted for
             participation because this would confound the hormonal measures.

          -  Women with clinically significant medical disorders will be excluded.

          -  A mean Body Mass Index (ratio of weight (W) to height (H) squared; W/H2=kg/m2) will be
             calculated. Women with a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) outside of the range of 18.0-27.0
             will be excluded.

          -  Treatment seeking study participants will not be selected but will be referred to
             local smoking cessation programs.

          -  Women taking any OTC medications on a regular basis (with the exception of
             multivitamin formulas) or prescription medications will be excluded.
