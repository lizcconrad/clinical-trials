  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of bevacizumab to ranibizumab in
      the treatment of patients with DME (OCT central area thickness &gt; 275 μm) as determined by the
      change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye from baseline to month 6.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To compare the effectiveness and costs of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab to 0.5 mg
      ranibizumab, given as monthly intravitreal injections during 6 months. It is hypothesized
      that bevacizumab is non-inferior to ranibizumab regarding its effectiveness.

      Study design: This will be a randomized, controlled, double masked, clinical trial in 246
      patients in seven academic trial centres in The Netherlands.

      Study population: patients 18 years of age or higher with diabetic macular and a best
      corrected visual acuity BCVA score between 78 and 20 letters in the study eye.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be the change in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) in the study eye from Baseline to Month 6.

      Secondary outcomes will be amongst others the proportion of patients with a gain of 15
      letters or more and/or a BCVA of 20/40 or more at 6 months, and the costs and costs per
      quality adjusted life-year of the two treatments.

             scar(s), epiretinal membrane involving fovea or organized hard exudate plaques;

         27. Any type of advanced, severe or unstable disease or its treatment, that may interfere
             with primary and/or secondary variable evaluations including any medical condition
             that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to such an extend that it may
             bias the assessment of the clinical status of the patient to a significant degree or
             put the patient at special risk;

         28. Concomitant conditions in the study eye which would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, prevent the improvement of visual acuity on study treatment;

         29. Ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound interpretation of study results,
             compromise visual acuity or require medical or surgical intervention during the
             6-month study period, including cataract, retinal vascular occlusion, retinal
             detachment, macular hole, or choroidal neovascularization of any cause (e.g., AMD,
             ocular histoplasmosis, or pathologic myopia).
