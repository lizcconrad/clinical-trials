      Set the pattern of vitamin D supplementation in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery
      in deficit of vitamin D.

      Patients receive a single oral dose of vitamin D, during the 28 days will be done a kinetic
      curve. Then and over the next 3 months, levels are normalized. Once normalized, will be
      administered another single oral dose to a second pharmacokinetic evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery (for bypass or sleeve
      gastrectomy) in deficit of vitamin D.

      Will include a total of 44 patients, 22 from each type of surgery. Patients receive a single
      oral dose of vitamin D of 50,000 IU. During the 28 days after administration of vitamin D
      will be done a kinetic curve determining plasma levels of vitamin D on 15 occasions. Then and
      over the next 3 months, levels are normalized by providing a daily oral dose for each
      patient. Once levels are normalized, will be administered another single oral dose of 50,000
      IU vitamin D and proceed to a second pharmacokinetic evaluation determining plasma levels 15
      times.

      Patient follow up is approximately 36 weeks. Patients go to the screening visit, baseline
      visit and visits on days 1, 2, 3, 14 and 28 days after each pharmacokinetic evaluation.
