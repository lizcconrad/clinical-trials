    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is a popular complementary/alternative therapy that has been in use for thousands
      of years for the treatment of various medical and psychiatric conditions, including Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). In this study, the investigators applied the investigators
      acupuncture-treatment-for-depression protocol, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
      principles for treating MDD, to depressed patients not taking any antidepressant medications
      (a protocol that the investigators previously piloted as a medication augmentation therapy
      for partial responders with MDD).

      The investigators specifically investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this
      TCM-based protocol for such patients, as well as potential differences in outcomes between
      weekly vs. twice-weekly treatment. The investigators hypothesized that acupuncture
      monotherapy would be associated with a response rate of at least 50%, which the investigators
      defined as a decrease in depressive symptoms from the beginning to the end of the study of
      50% or more, and that the response would be greater among patients who received acupuncture 2
      times per week (vs. 1 time per week). The investigators also hypothesized that acupuncture
      would be associated with minimal side effects.

    <description>The HAM-D-17 is a clinician-rated assessment (structured interview) of patients' depressive symptoms. Questions focus on depressive symptoms during the past 7 days, and higher cumulative scores (possible responses to each item range from 0-4 or 0-2) indicate more severe depression.</description>
