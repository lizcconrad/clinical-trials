      This study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of renal denervation in the treatment of
      uncontrolled hypertension. This study will enroll a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 45
      subjects. The study will be conducted at up to 8 actively enrolling investigational sites.
      The primary endpoint is change in Office Systolic Blood Pressure from baseline to 6 months
      post-procedure.

    <description>Previous research has shown that disrupting the nerves of the kidney may successfully decrease blood pressure.
A less invasive approach to disrupting these nerves is to apply a brief high temperature near the nerves (renal denervation). This can now be done with an experimental medical device called the Symplicity renal denervation system. The System includes a catheter that is inserted into your blood vessels and an RF-generator.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Individual is 18 and 80 years old at time of treatment.

          2. Individual is receiving a stable medication regimen including 3 or more
             anti-hypertensive medications of different classes, of which one must be a diuretic
             that is expected to be maintained without changes for at least 6 months.

          3. Individual has an office systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg based on an average of 3
             blood pressure readings measured at screening visits

          4. Individual or legally authorized representative agrees to have all study procedures
             performed, and is competent and willing to provide written, informed consent to
             participate in this clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individual has renal artery anatomy that is ineligible for treatment including:

               -  Main renal arteries with less than 4 mm diameter or with less than 20 mm
                  treatable length

               -  Multiple renal arteries where the main renal artery is estimated to supply less
                  than 75 percent of the kidney.

               -  Renal artery stenosis more than 50 percent or renal artery aneurysm in either
                  renal artery.

               -  A history of prior renal artery intervention including balloon angioplasty or
                  stenting.

          2. Individual has an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 45mL per min per
             1.73m2, using the MDRD calculation.

          3. Individual has had more than 1 in-patient hospitalization for a hypertensive crisis
             within the past year.

          4. Individual has type 1 diabetes mellitus.

          5. Individual has had 1 or more episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension within
             the past year or during the screening process.

          6. Individual requires chronic oxygen support or mechanical ventilation other than
             nocturnal respiratory support for sleep apnea.

          7. Individual has primary pulmonary hypertension.

          8. Individual has known secondary causes of hypertension, such as untreated
             pheochromocytoma, Cushing's Disease, coarctation of the aorta, hyperthyroidism, or
             hyperparathyroidism.

          9. Individual has experienced a myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, syncope,
             or a cerebrovascular accident within 6 months of the screening period, or has
             widespread atherosclerosis, with documented intravascular thrombosis or unstable
             plaques.

         10. Individual has a scheduled or planned surgery or cardiovascular intervention in the
             next 6 months.

         11. Individual has a condition that would prohibit or interfere with ability to obtain an
             accurate blood pressure measurement using the protocol specified automatic blood
             pressure monitor

         12. Individual has severe cardiac valve stenosis for which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, a significant reduction of blood pressure is contraindicated.

         13. Individual has any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, may adversely affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the participant
             or the study

         14. Individual is pregnant, nursing or planning to be pregnant.

         15. Individual has a known, unresolved history of drug use or alcohol dependency, lacks
             the ability to comprehend or follow instructions, or would be unlikely or unable to
             comply with study follow-up requirements.

         16. Individual is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial. For
             the purposes of this protocol, participants involved in extended follow-up trials for
             products that were investigational but are currently commercially available are not
             considered enrolled in an investigational trial.
