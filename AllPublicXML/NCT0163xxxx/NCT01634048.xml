  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major problem worldwide and current dietary interventions are not proving to be
      enough to cease the increase in levels of obesity and its detrimental side effects, such as
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

      Existing data suggests that adjustments in the macronutrient composition of the diet, more
      specifically the protein content, may have beneficial effects on body composition and an
      antiobesegenic effect on appetite. This may be important in terms of controlling body weight
      and reducing the amount of fatty tissue within our bodies and organs, and therefore
      preventing obesity and its health related side effects.

      The investigators will perform a study to investigate whether a high protein low energy diet
      compared to a normal protein low energy diet, in overweight adults can modify appetite and
      aid loss of weight and fat mass. Subjects will receive either a high protein low energy diet
      (1.34g protein/kg body weight) or a normal protein low energy diet (0.8g protein/kg body
      weight) in the form of 2 meal replacements and one conventional meal per day with 2 snacks
      for 12 weeks.

      HYPOTHESIS In overweight subjects with the metabolic syndrome, a 12 week dietary intervention
      with a high protein low energy diet will lead to a reduced appetite, body weight and fat
      mass, more specifically to a greater fall in levels of fat in the liver and pancreas than a
      low energy normal protein diet.

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in body weight and body composition, more specifically visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas fat content will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Individual's data will be compared at baseline and at 12 weeks of following the diet and also to that of the participants given normal protein low energy diets. This data may therefore support our hypothesis that high protein intakes may help to aid weight loss and reduce fat mass and would therefore be a viable option in the treatment of obesity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in appetite regulation, measured by VAS, gut hormones and food intake.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It has also been suggested that highprotein diets are more beneficial in the regulation of appetite. We therefore aim to measure any changes in appetite whilst on a highprotein lowenergy diet compared to a normalprotein lowenergy diet. Changes in appetite will be measured using validated questionnaires assessing subjects feeling of hunger, pleasantness and volume able to eat as well as fullness. This data may support our hypothesis that highprotein intakes may alter appetite regulation and therefore be a useful in the treatment of obesity.</description>

Meal replacements have been used in hundreds of previous human studies and are generally not found to be linked to any serious adverse effects.</description>
