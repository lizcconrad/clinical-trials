  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment involves administering propranolol, a medication indicated for treating high
      blood pressure. Propranolol is hypothesized to reduce the strength of drug or alcohol
      cravings (an integral factor involved in relapse), specifically when memories of substance
      use are recalled. In this study, propranolol or a placebo will be administered to patients
      participating in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation facility once a week over three or six
      weeks. After receiving propranolol or placebo, strong memories associated with substance
      craving are recalled by asking participants to read aloud a summary of a substance use
      experience. The investigators hypothesize that participants who receive propranolol will
      report fewer and less intense drug or alcohol cravings than participants who receive the
      placebo or treatment-as-usual.

      Trial Objectives: To test the feasibility of reconsolidation blockade as an adjunct treatment
      for reducing drug or alcohol cravings in individuals diagnosed with a substance dependence or
      substance abuse disorder and participating in a drug rehabilitation program.

      Study Design and Duration: This study will be a 3 to 6 week, randomized, double-blind trial
      involving participants with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of substance dependence or abuse. Consented
      participants meeting enrolment criteria will receive a dose of propranolol (1mg/kg) or
      placebo ninety minutes before undergoing a brief memory reactivation procedure twice a week
      for a three-week period (or once a week for a six week period, depending on the participants
      availability) as an adjunct to their usual drug rehabilitation treatment. Participants will
      be randomized to one of two treatment arms (i.e. placebo group + treatment as usual, or
      propranolol group + treatment as usual) and remain in that arm for the duration of the study.
      Participants from the placebo arm will be offered the opportunity to continue receive
      open-label propranolol treatment for another 3-6 weeks following the double-blind phase of
      the study. A four-month follow-up assessment will also be conducted.

    <description>The craving scales ask about current craving for substances. Items for the questionnaires represent distinct conceptualizations of substance craving: (1) desire to use; (2) anticipation of positive outcomes from use; (3) anticipation of relief from withdrawal symptoms or relief from negative mood; (4) intention and planning to use; (5) lack of control over use.</description>
