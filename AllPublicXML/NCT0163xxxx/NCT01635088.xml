    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are appreciated for their long term anti-inflammatory effects
      in chronic asthma. However, they also have largely unappreciated early effects when initiated
      as a controller therapy in a steroid-na√Øve population. Impulse oscillometry might reveal such
      an early effect better than spirometry. The investigators sought to examine the onset of
      action and sustained effects over 4 weeks treatment of mometasone furoate as measured by
      Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS) versus spirometry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18-65 years inclusive.

          -  Written informed consent (conducted according to the GCP and ICH guidelines) to
             participate in the study. Ability to comply with all study requirements.

          -  Mild to moderate persistent asthma with symptoms at least 2 times per week, managed by
             as-needed SABA only.

          -  A 35% or greater improvement in small airway dysfunction defined by IOS AX after
             inhaled SABA.

          -  Allergic response to one or more common allergens at screening via skin test.

          -  Male, or female of childbearing potential using a medically approved birth control
             method.

          -  Evidence of SAD manifested by an index of peripheral airway reactance of &gt; 10.5 cm
             H2O/L (3 times the upper limit of adult normal).

          -  Symptoms of airflow obstruction (i.e. dyspnea on exertion greater than peers at
             similar exercise levels, wheeze, or cough &gt; 3 weeks without respiratory infection, or
             nocturnal dyspnea, and use of SABA &gt; 2 times per week)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with severe persistent asthma and/or subjects taking inhaled or systemic
             corticosteroids or long acting beta agonists (LABA).

          -  Subjects &lt; 18 years of age or &gt; 65 years.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  History of diabetes.

          -  Acute infections within 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Concurrent medical condition that might interfere with the interpretation of efficacy
             and safety data during the study.

          -  Contraindications and warnings according to the specific label for Asmanex.

          -  Chronic inhaled or systemic corticosteroid treatment (&gt; 7 consecutive days of
             treatment) within 30 days prior to Screening.

          -  Investigational drug treatment within 30 days prior to Screening. Treatment with any
             drug with a known and frequent toxicity to a major organ system within the past 60
             days.
