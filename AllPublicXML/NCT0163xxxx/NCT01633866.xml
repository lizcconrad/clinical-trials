      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and optimize advances in radio frequency (RF) coil
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
      (CCHMC).

    <textblock>
      Pediatric Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques have been limited by the unavailability
      of specialized radio-frequency (RF) coils for pediatric imaging. Typically, MR coils are
      designed for general purpose adult imaging and lack the mechanical design, flexibility and
      high channel count needed for pediatric imaging. Furthermore, pediatric patients are often
      positioned decubitus or prone rather than supine. This makes coil positioning even more
      challenging and often results in images with low SNR and poor image quality. Many coils used
      in clinical practice have fixed dimensions that do not fit within the realm of &quot;one-size fits
      all,&quot; especially for the huge variation found in the pediatric patient population.

      MRI coil development and optimization is performed by MR manufacturers and in research
      laboratories across the world including the Imaging Research Center (IRC) of Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital and Medical Center (CCHMC). Coil development and refinement involves
      evaluating the new coils on inert phantoms and then imaging examinations performed on healthy
      participants and patients. The focus of this study protocol is to evaluate the design and
      performance of investigational coils on patients and healthy participants.

        Healthy participants will be recruited by word-of-mouth, generally from within CCHMC.The
        healthy participants could include children of faculty or staff members of CCHMC.Because
        the healthy participants could include children of faculty or staff members, recruitment
        will be consistent with CCHMC Research Policy.Patients will be recruited at the time of
        their scheduled clinical scan.We are only using these participants to evaluate the safety
        and feasibility of the use of the new coils in our patient population.For this reason, we
        will not focus on the demographics of the participants.However, we will attempt to obtain a
        broad anatomic size range to match that of the patient population for which the coils were
        developed.
