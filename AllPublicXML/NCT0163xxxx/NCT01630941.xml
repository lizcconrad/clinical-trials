  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to study the effect of Denosumab on Bone Mineral Density,
      Standardised Uptake Value and bone metabolism in patients with total hip arthroplasty. The
      primary hypothesis is to demonstrate that Denosumab is superior to placebo.

    <textblock>
      A clinical study with 64 patients, age 35-65 years, with unilateral osteoarthritis of the
      hip, randomised to two groups of patients, either receiving Denosumab or placebo

      The patients will operated with an uncemented total hip arthroplasty with a Continuum
      acetabular cup with trabecular surface (Tantalum) and longevity Highly Cross-linked
      Polyethylene liner, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA, and a CFP femoral stem with Titanium surface and
      a chrome cobalt 28 mm head, Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany.

      Clinical outcome evaluated by Harris Hip Score and EQ-5D, Bone Mineral Density by DXA,
      Standardised Uptake Value of Fluoride tracer, by PET/CT and biochemical markers for bone
      formation and bone resorption will be analyzed together with conventional radiology for
      implant position and fixation.

             Anesthesiologists, ASA-score &gt;31 should not be regarded eligible

          5. patients with known drug or alcohol abuse or regarded as socially dysfunctional, as
             judged by the investigator, should not be considered for the study

          6. pregnant women or women planning for pregnancy or fertile women (premenopausal)

             device study, or in another investigational study of an approved drug within 30 days
             prior to Visit 1 of the current study

          9. any condition or laboratory findings which in the opinion of the Investigator makes
             the patient unsuitable for inclusion (for example claustrophobia)
