  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of writing about chronic pain on mental
      and physical health. The effectiveness of two different types of brief online writing
      interventions will be explored in individuals with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly prevalent and costly, but often not treated effectively. Psychological
      interventions are needed as part of chronic pain treatment since the pain affects many
      aspects of an individual's life. In particular, brief psychological interventions that are
      easily accessible (i.e., online) could benefit many people with chronic pain. Writing
      interventions have been used in recent years to understand difficult experiences. Writing
      interventions have been found to help individuals explore distressing thoughts and feelings,
      such as those that are associated with pain.
