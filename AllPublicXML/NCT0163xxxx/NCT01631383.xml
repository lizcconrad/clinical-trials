  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of l-THP with cocaine exposure in
      people who have a history of cocaine use. The subject will be admitted to the Brief Stay Unit
      (BSU), an inpatient facility at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, used for short term
      drug abuse or clinical trial studies. The participant will stay for 4 nights and 5 days.
      He/she will be randomized to either placebo or l-THP for three days. On the morning of Day 4,
      the subject will receive one cocaine dose (40 mg intranasal) and have testing for
      pharmacokinetic parameters for the following 10 hours. The subject will stay over one more
      night and will be discharged the following day. Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized
      to enroll the target sample of 30 (N=15 placebo, N=15 l-THP). In summary, each subject will
      come for a screening visit(s), then a 5-day, 4-night stay on a secure research unit. After
      cocaine administration day, the participant will stay overnight for one more day of
      observation and to permit substantial l-THP elimination from the body. The following morning
      we will get one additional blood specimen for l-THP (Day 5 at 24 hours after last dose (7:30
      am); then the participant will be discharged. A visit with blood collection on Day 6 at 55
      hours after last dose (2:30 pm) will be scheduled. A final follow-up visit will be scheduled
      4-7 days after unit discharge to ensure no persisting side effects.
