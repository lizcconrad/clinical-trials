  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of music therapy before, during, and
      after cardiac catheterization is associated on (a) change in reactive hyperemia index
      measured before and after catheterization using peripheral arterial tonometry and (b) patient
      stress and discomfort measured by a questionnaire, as compared to the standard of care (no
      music during cardiac catheterization).

      The hypothesis of the study is that music therapy during cardiac catheterization will be
      associated with more favorable change in reactive hyperemia and higher patient satisfaction
      compared to no music playback.
