  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unruptured brain aneurysms and pain syndromes like trigeminal neuralgias often
      undergo minimally invasive brain surgery with a smaller incision,shorter duration of
      procedure and in some patients the possibility of going home on same day. Postoperative pain,
      nausea and vomiting are sometimes difficult to manage with conventional medications. This
      affects recovery from surgery and often delays discharge from the hospital. This study looks
      at the use of a medication called sumatriptan which is a drug that has been used in the
      treatment of migraine headaches for a very long time. This drug works on the receptors in the
      lining of the brain and around the nerves which maybe associated with pain. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if this pain medication sumatriptan given at the end of the
      surgery improves the postoperative course in terms of less pain, less nausea and vomiting and
      generally having a better postoperative quality of recovery.

      Our main hypothesis is that subcutaneous sumatriptan (6mg) administered at the end of surgery
      will improve the postoperative quality of recovery at 24 hours after elective minimally
      invasive craniotomies.
