      This is a first in human, prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label,
      dose-escalation study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      immunogenicity of repeat doses of CSL362.

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:
A non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or worse.
A hematological toxicity grade 3 that does not recover to baseline within 14 days.

    <description>CSL362 is humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha chain of the interleukin 3 receptor (IL3Rα; also known as CD123) and is optimised for enhanced activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via natural killer cells.
CSL362 is a sterile solution for injection and will be administered by intravenous infusion to subjects in sequential, escalating dose level cohorts, at doses up to 12.0 mg/kg. CSL362 will be administered every 14 days for a total of 6 infusions per subject. The 6 infusions for each individual subject will contain the same dose of CSL362.</description>
