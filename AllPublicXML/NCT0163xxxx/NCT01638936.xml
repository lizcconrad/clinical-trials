  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test safety and anti-tumor activity of BT062 in combination
      with lenalidomide and dexamethasone to define the best doses for treating patients with
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT062 is an antibody-drug conjugate designed to bind and destroy Myeloma cells. The study
      drug is being given in multiple doses with standard Multiple Myeloma treatments, lenalidomide
      and dexamethasone, to test how well the treatments are tolerated and work together. This
      study is a dose escalation study with the purpose to find out the highest dose of BT062 that
      a subject can tolerate in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

    <measure>Determination of optimal dose of BT062 (Phase I part)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Phase I part will follow a standard dose escalation design with at least 3 patients per dose level to define optimal dose of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. Optimal dose will be defined by dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during Cycle 1 (28 days).</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of response (Phase IIa part)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment with optimal dose of BT062 (defined in Phase I part) in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone will be evaluated at baseline and at start of each Cycle (every 28 days). Response evaluation will be primarily based on assessment of M-protein and serum free light chains. If clinically required bone marrow analysis, plasmacytoma evaluation, and skeletal survey will be performed.</description>
