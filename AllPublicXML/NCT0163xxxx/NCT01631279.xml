  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Dose-Limiting
      Toxicity of the drug to further evaluate safety and antitumor activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent, subjects undergo baseline evaluation and disease assessment.
      PR610 is administered intravenously weekly.

      In the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, subjects may continue to
      receive PR610. Intra-subject dose escalation (to no higher than the highest safe level) is
      allowed in subjects who are not experiencing dose limiting toxicity. Disease assessment will
      be repeated at week 6 and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment (PR610 and PR610E) will be performed for all subjects.

      After determination of the MTD and the determination of the phase II dose, additional
      subjects with NSCLC that is genetically resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors will be
      accrued into an expansion cohort.

    <description>The first cohort of three subjects will receive PR610 at Dose Level 1. Subsequent cohorts will receive PR610 at a dose levels determined as per dose escalation criteria. The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which one (1) or fewer subject in six exhibit DLT with the next highest dose level demonstrating two (2) or more of six (6) subjects with DLT (or for which more than â‰¥33% of subjects exhibit DLT if the cohort size exceeds 6 subjects).</description>

    <description>DLT is defined as the following:
Occurs during the first cycle of PR610
Is considered PR610-related, as defined by &quot;Definitely-related&quot;, &quot;Probably-related&quot; or &quot;Possibly-related&quot;
Is clinically significant, as determined by the Principal Investigator
In addition, DLT will meet at least one of the criteria listed below using grading criteria from the CTCAEv4.
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity
Any drug-related toxicity that prevents administration of 100% of all doses of PR610 planned for Cycle 1
Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity</description>
