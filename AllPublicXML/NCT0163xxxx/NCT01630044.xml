    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized and unblinded study designed to generate preliminary
      data to assess the effect of a new portable non-invasive brainstem stimulator to treat
      migraine headaches in patients with episodic migraine headaches.

      This study is a single-center, unblinded, non-randomized clinical trial for adjunctive
      prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine headache using neuromodulation device developed
      by Scion NeuroStim, LLC (SNS). The investigational use of the device for episodic migraine
      headache has been reviewed by the FDA and is classified as NSR (non-significant risk).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  On a Monthly basis, at least four, and not more than a total of fourteen Headache Days
             (Pain Score between one and ten) of which between four and nine are Migraine Headache
             Days (Pain Score between five and ten). NOTE: For clarification, the occurrence of
             Headaches is counted taking into account, and making no adjustments for, the
             medications that the subjects are taking;

          -  A history of some responsiveness (incomplete) to at least one and a maximum of two
             prophylactic pharmaceutical therapies (utilized concurrently);

          -  The investigator must have confidence in the patient's ability to reliably complete
             and return the Daily Headache Diary.

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who are pregnant, who have a history of cardiovascular disease, who work
             night shifts or who have vestibular migraine, menstrual migraine, posttraumatic
             migraine, a history of unstable mood disorder or unstable anxiety, moderate or greater
             hearing loss or a history of traumatic brain injury will be excluded from the Study.

          -  A history within the last six months of tobacco use, narcotic or barbiturates use or
             experiencing one or more analgesic rebound headaches.
