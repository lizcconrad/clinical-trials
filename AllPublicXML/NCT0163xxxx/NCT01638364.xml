      The purpose of this study is to examine whether there is an increase in dopamine levels in
      the human striatum following an oral administration of alcohol, as has been evidenced in
      animal models. This will be a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study using the radiotracer,
      [11C]-(+)-PHNO (11C]-( + )-4-propyl-
      3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b][1,4]oxazin-9-ol).

      This will be a within subjects study in 8 heavy drinkers ages 21-45. The within factors will
      be PET scans following an alcoholic beverage and following a non-alcoholic beverage.
      Participants will also have a baseline session prior to the scans where they will complete
      various cognitive tasks and questionnaires. During each PET scan, subjective drug effects as
      well as heart rate, blood pressure, blood alcohol content and cortisol levels will be
      collected. The change in PHNO binding potential between the two scan conditions will be the
      primary outcome measure.

    <description>Following the injection of the positron-emitting radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO, binding of this radiotracer to dopamine receptors (DR) D2/3 will be measured using the PET scanner. As dopamine also binds to DR D2/3, either an increase or decrease in dopamine levels will either decrease or increase PHNO occupancy respectively. [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding potential will be measured on two different conditions (alcoholic beverage vs non-alcoholic beverage) on two separate days.</description>
