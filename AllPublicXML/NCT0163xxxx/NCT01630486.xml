      The goals of the KNOW-CKD (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Chronic Kidney
      Disease) study are 1) to establish a CKD cohort representing Korean CKD population for up to
      10-year follow-up, and 2) to investigate the renal progression, mortality, complications,
      risk factors, role of biochemical parameters and the genetic influence.

      KNOW-CKD Research Group comprises nephrologists, pediatric nephrologists, epidemiologists and
      statisticians from eleven centers in Korea. KNOW-CKD will enroll 2,850 individuals with CKD
      stage from 1 to 5 between 2011 and 2015 and follow them up to 10 years. Dialyzed patients or
      those with allograft kidney are excluded. At enrollment and at pre-specified intervals,
      laboratory tests will be conducted on the kidney function, biochemical profiles, anemia,
      cardiovascular complication (echocardiography, coronary CT, arterial stiffness), and mineral
      bone disorder. A biobank is also established for the DNA, serum and urine at regular
      interval. Information on the medical history, health questionnaires, QoL will also be
      collected. Web-based case-report forms (CRF) is developed for the systemic management of the
      patient data.
