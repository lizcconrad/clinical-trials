  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - People with congenital heart disease may develop heart failure earlier that those who do
      not have the disease. One theory to explain this is that the heart s own blood supply may be
      different in people with congenital heart disease. Problems with this blood supply can
      severely damage the heart. This damage can be studied with a heart imaging test called a
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Researchers want to use this type of scan to
      look at the blood supply to the heart in people with congenital heart disease.

      Objectives:

      - To learn more about the blood supply to the heart in people with congenital heart disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have heart defects caused by congenital heart
      disease.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have a cardiac MRI scan to look at the blood flow to the heart.

        -  Participants will also have a heart stress test to measure heart function during
           exercise.

        -  Other imaging studies of the heart may be performed to collect more information on heart
           function.

      This is a study of the perfusion of the myocardium in adults with specific forms of repaired
      congenital heart disease using established cardiac MRI techniques and correlating perfusion
      with clinical outcomes. Our objectives are to examine myocardial perfusion both during stress
      and at rest in adults with repaired or palliated congenital heart disease as well as quantify
      ventricular function, regional myocardial strain and evidence of myocardial fibrosis with
      quantitative measures of myocardial perfusion. The specific aim of this study is to
      understand whether clinical subendocardial perfusion defects contribute to the late
      decompensation of adult subjects that have single ventricle physiology and adult subjects
      that have a systemic right ventricle.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion Criteria for All Arms of the Protocol:

          -  Subjects 18 years of age or older

          -  All defects that have a right ventricle that supports the systemic circulation

          -  All defects with a functional single ventricle

          -  Written informed consent

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion Criteria for All Arms of the Protocol:

          -  Subjects with a contraindication to MRI scanning will be excluded. These
             contraindications include subjects with the following devices:

               -  Central nervous system aneurysm clips

               -  Implanted neural stimulator

               -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator

               -  Cochlear implant

               -  Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)

               -  Implanted Insulin pump

               -  Metal shrapnel or bullet

          -  Severe heart damage that makes it difficult to breathe while lying flat

          -  Pregnant women (Women of childbearing potential who are uncertain as to whether they
             are pregnant will be required to have a screening urine or blood pregnancy test)

          -  Subjects with active symptoms of myocardial ischemia occurring despite maximally
             tolerated doses of oral antianginal therapy and intravenous nitroglycerin

        Furthermore, the following subject groups will be excluded from studies involving the
        administration of MRI contrast agents:

          -  lactating women unless they are willing to discard breast milk for 24 hours after
             receiving gadolinium

          -  renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 body
             surface area)

        The eGFR will be used to estimate renal function if reported by the laboratory. Otherwise,
        estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be based on the Modification of Diet in
        Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation (see below) in subjects with stable renal function.
        This formula is not applicable to subjects with acute renal insufficiency:

        eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine)-1.154 x (age)-0.203 x 0.742 (if the
        subject is female) x 1.212 (if the subject is black)

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Vasodilator Stress MRI:

          -  Myocardial infarction within 24 hours

          -  Uncontrolled heart failure

          -  Uncontrolled asthma or emphysema

          -  Ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular arrhythmia at the time of MR scan)

          -  Second degree heart block or higher
