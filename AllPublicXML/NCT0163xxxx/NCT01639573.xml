  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II pilot trial seeks to demonstrate that prolonged administration of Campath-1H
      without prior marrow or stem cell harvesting can result in immunoablation similar to that
      achieved by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from either bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell sources in children and adolescents with severe treatment
      refractory systemic sclerosis (SSc).

    <description>Pediatric patients with dcSSc are eligible for the clinical trial if they fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are based upon those of the SCOT trial for adult dcSSc patients, which is the Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States comparing autologous HSCT to monthly high dose cyclophosphamide (CY) alone.</description>

          -  Lack of rehabilitation potential

        4.3 SSc patients, who fulfill the inclusion criteria, will then be assessed for residual
        thymic function since our previous study of pediatric dcSSc patients demonstrated that the
        dcSSc patients had decreased thymic function as compared to age matched controls as
        measured by the proportion of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4+, CD31+), recent thymic
        emigrants (RTE). (5) Patients with less than 40% RTE will be excluded because of concerns
        about their ability to reconstitute their immune system after immune ablation.

        4.4 dcSSc patients, who fulfill the screening criteria, will be consented for entry into
        the clinical trial.
