    <textblock>
      Scientists have studied how fasting and nutrients affect brain function in animals. The
      purpose of this study is to look at the effects of both fasting and food intake on brain
      function and memory in humans. To do this the investigators will use functional MRI to
      observe the brain and its function while fasting and after a meal. Understanding the action
      of these hormones in the brain may eventually lead to new ways to help people avoid obesity
      or lose weight.

      Potential subjects will participate in a short phone screening interview and if eligible,
      will come to the University of Washington hospital 2 times. At the first health screening
      visit, we will go over the subjects' medical history, weight and height, and eating habits.
      This visit will take an hour or so and eligible subjects will then schedule the study visit.
      For the study visit, subjects will have to fast overnight from 9:30 pm the night before and
      arrive at the hospital at 8:00am. At 8:30 am, the subject will have a 30 minute MRI scan of
      the brain done in the University of Washington Radiology Department. During the MRI scan they
      will see pictures of common objects and foods and be asked to remember the photos they saw.
      At 9 am subjects will eat a standard breakfast, and they will not eat again until after the
      second MRI. The time of their second MRI will be randomly assigned to one of seven time
      points anywhere from 15 minutes to 5 hours after the breakfast. After the MRI, subjects will
      be allowed to eat freely from food we provide. Subjects will receive $10 for the health
      screening visit, and $50-85 depending on the length of the visit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BOLD response as measured by brain fMRI during viewing of food photographs</measure>
    <time_frame>We will randomly assign subjects to one of 7 timepoints for a post-meal brain MRI - 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300 minutes after their breakfast.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the change in brain response (as captured by MRI) to visual food cues with food intake is a marker of satiety. We hypothesize that consumption of a meal will reduce brain activation by food cues and that these reductions will be temporally associated with both subjective and objective measures of satiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary endpoints are the amount of food eaten at a lunch buffet and self-reported appetite ratings.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 30 minutes throughout study.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure subjective appetite and satiety, subjects will complete serial visual analog rating scales (VAS) of hunger and fullness every 30 minutes. We predict that the percentage change in brain activation will correlate with changes in self-reported hunger and fullness. After the post-meal scan, we will obtain measurements of objective satiety for each subject by monitoring his or her food intake during a 30 minute ad libitum buffet meal. The buffet will be surreptitiously monitored, allowing us to assess ad libitum caloric intake and food choices.</description>

          2. Body mass index (BMI) 18.5-24.9 kg/m2

               -  Age and weight are restricted because of known changes in appetite and satiety
                  with aging and changes in body weight.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Chronic health conditions, including diabetes

          4. Use of medications that alter appetite (e.g., atypical anti-psychotics)

          5. Pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives of estrogen replacement

          6. Participation in other studies that might affect appetite or body weight

                  diabetes, chronic disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer), and estrogen
                  use are restricted or excluded due to documented influences on the hormones of
                  interest. Smokers and regular alcohol users are excluded consistent with prior
                  studies of appetite regulation.
