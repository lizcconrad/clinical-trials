    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to add to the investigators' quest to understanding stone
      disease, by evaluating the metabolites excretion in urine and its relation to microflora
      present in the stool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stones affect up to 10% of the Canadian population and can lead to pain,
      hospitalization, lost of time at work, and surgery. Approximately 80% of stones consist of
      calcium and oxalate, of which both components come from diet and normal bodily processes.
      Individuals who have high levels of oxalate in their urine have a greater tendency to
      generate stones. One recommendation is to reduce their intake of oxalate-containing foods,
      but many healthy foods contain oxalate, and an oxalate-free diet is unpalatable and difficult
      to achieve. Some patients, despite reducing their oxalate intake, still have high amounts in
      the urine.

      Intestinal metabolism is largely affected by the state and composition of the intestinal
      bacterial flora, with several metabolic diseases being linked to a disrupted &quot;normal&quot;
      intestinal flora. The investigators believe that calcium oxalate stone disease as well as
      high urinary levels of oxalate (hyperoxaluria) are triggered by inefficient oxalate
      metabolism in the intestine, which is linked to a &quot;disrupted&quot; intestinal bacterial flora that
      lacks certain key components such as O. formigenes. The long-term purpose of this study is
      therefore, to determine the effect of replenishing the intestinal flora of patients with that
      of &quot;normal&quot; controls, thereby re-introducing a balanced environment that will lead to the
      re-establishment of normal metabolic functions and a decrease in urinary oxalate levels and
      hopefully lower incidence of stone disease.

    <description>The objective of this study is to compare the bacterial flora in the intestine of patients with kidney stones compared to non-stone forming individuals. If there are differences between stone forming and non-stone forming individuals in the content of their bacterial flora, these will also be correlated with levels of metabolites found in the urine that are known risk factors of stone disease. Difference in bacterial intestinal flora already exists for patients who are obese compared to non-obese individuals.</description>

        Subjects in the study group are seen at Vancouver General Hospital for their kidney stone
        disease. Subjects in the control group do not have history or family history of kidney
        stones and can join the study if they are eligible, wiling to participate, and can provide
        their specimens at Vancouver General Hospital.
