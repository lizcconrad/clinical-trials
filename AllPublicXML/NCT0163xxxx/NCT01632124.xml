      The objective of this study is to investigate whether rituximab (RTX), a drug commonly
      prescribed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or inflammatory myositis, is associated
      with subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD). Surrogate markers for interstitial lung
      diseases are a decrease of the forced vital capacity (FVC) and/or the diffusing capacity of
      the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). However, the measurement of these lung function
      parameters is indicated as regular follow-up examinations during the treatment with RTX
      according to the principles of &quot;good clinical practice&quot;. We will perform pulmonary function
      testing (spirometry) including measurement of the DLCO in patients with RA, who are going to
      be treated with RTX. A baseline lung function measurement will be performed immediately
      before RTX therapy is started. Follow-up measurements will be performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks,
      8 weeks and 6 months after initiation of RTX therapy. A reduction in forced vital capacity
      (FVC) of &gt;10% or a fall of &gt;15% in DLCO will be defined as indicative for ILD.
