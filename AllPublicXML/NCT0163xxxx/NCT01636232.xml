  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The higher rate of vitamin D deficiency is spotted among patients being hospitalized or in
      critical condition. Especially, vitamin D level below normal prolongs hospital stay and
      increases incidence of adverse prognosis and pushing up mortality of a number of diseases.
      However, it is remain unclear the relationship between vitamin D levels and critically ill,
      especially infection or sepsis. In this study, the investigators evaluate the significance of
      vitamin D for diagnosis and other relevant assessments of ICU cases, including vitamin D's
      relevance to sepsis, as well as its value in severity and prognosis assessment,
      high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the
      quantification of the total 25(OH)D in serum of critically ill patients. The investigators
      speculate that measurement of vitamin D could be taken as an indicator for diagnosis and
      assessment in critically ill patients.
