  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected mothers with positive hepatitis B e antigen
      (HBeAg) have an increased risk of becoming infected with HBV. This study will determine
      whether telbivudine among both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBeAg positive
      pregnant women during the third trimester, in addition to standard immunoprophylaxis in
      infants, will be more effective than standard immunoprophylaxis alone at preventing HBV
      infections in these infants.

    <textblock>
      Infants of HBV-infected mothers with positive HBeAg have an increased risk of becoming
      infected with HBV. Standard immunoprophylaxis against mother-to-infant transmission of HBV
      includes administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine;
      however, approximately 5-15% of the infants are not protected despite having received these
      preventive measures. It is reported that antiviral prophylaxis among HBV-infected pregnant
      women can reduce mother-to-infant transmission of HBV. However, more research is needed to
      obtain the definite conclusion. This study will determine whether telbivudine among HBsAg-
      and HBeAg-positive pregnant women during the third trimester, in addition to standard
      immunoprophylaxis in infants, will be more effective than standard immunoprophylaxis alone at
      preventing HBV infections in these infants.

    <description>HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive pregnant women at 28-32 weeks of gestation are given with telbivudine (oral 600 mg/day) until 4 weeks after delivery. Newborn infants are administered 100-200 IU HBIG within 12 hours after birth and vaccinated against hepatitis B with yeast recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (10 Âµg) at 0, 1, and 6-month schedule. HBV DNA and ALT levels are measured before the use of telbivudine, at delivery, and 1-2 months after stopping the drug. HBV serological markers, including HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc, HBeAg and anti-HBe are tested in infants at age of 7-12 months.</description>
