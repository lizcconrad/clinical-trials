    <textblock>
      In patients with suspected APE (Acute Pulmonary Embolism) referred to the intensive care unit
      (ICU)after major surgery, serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal proBNP), Troponin-I and D-dimers were
      measured according to the standard hospital protocol. To definitively confirm or exclude APE,
      all patients underwent an angiographic CT-scan of the thorax.

      In patients with suspected APE referred to the intensive care unit after major surgery, serum
      NT-proBNP, Troponin-I and D-dimers were measured according to the standard hospital protocol.
      Blood samples were obtained within one hour after the onset of clinical symptoms.

      Definitive confirmation or exclusion of APE was performed with an angiographic CT-scan of the
      thorax.
