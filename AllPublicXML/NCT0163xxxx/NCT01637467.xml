  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is the therapy used to passively activate muscles using
      electrodes on the surface of the skin. EMS may be helpful in preserving muscle function in
      people who are on bedrest due to critical illness in the intensive care unit. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of implementing EMS in critically ill
      patients who are on mechanical ventilation for greater than 7 days, and examine the effects
      of 4 weeks of EMS on leg muscle size, muscle strength and functional outcomes in these
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that EMS will be safe and feasible and that
      critically ill patients receiving EMS will show a smaller loss of muscle size and strength
      than those in the control group, who do not receive EMS.
