      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility, and performance of the C2
      Focal Cryoablation Device in patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE). At 6 to 8 weeks, the
      patient will receive a follow-endoscopy to assess stricture formation along with biopsy
      samples taken.

      Post-operative pain will be noted. Additionally, biopsy samples will be evaluated for the
      presence of residual Barrett's Esophagus. Through evaluation of the histological results,
      treatment parameters for the ablation of human esophageal epithelium will be better
      understood.

      Evaluations include, but are not limited to the following:

        -  Deployment ease/scope compatibility.

        -  Device malfunctions.

        -  Time of catheter deployment.

        -  Adverse events.

        -  Stricture formation at 6 to 8 weeks.

        -  Patient Pain.

        -  Histological evaluation of treatment zone at 6 to 8 weeks for presence of residual
           Barrett's Esophagus.

    <measure>Esophageal Stricture</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stricture formation is defined as none, mild (non-circumferential stenosis allowing easy passage of diagnostic endoscope), moderate (circular stenosis allowing passage of diagnostic endoscope), and severe (any stenosis preventing the passage of a diagnostic scope).</description>

    <measure>Post-procedure pain relative</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-ablation,12 hrs post ablation, 2 days (+ or - 1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary objective of the study is to determine patient comfort post-procedure. Pain scores are measured on a numerical pain intensity scale (0 to 10). Patients is asked to score pain level in the treatment area and swallowing.</description>

    <description>Esophageal tissue subjected to ablation via the CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System will be submitted for histological evaluation. The evaluation will include:
detailed description of the presence of Barrett's Esophagus and/or squamous mucosa.
