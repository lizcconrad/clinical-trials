  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate effects of treatment with varenicline, a smoking cessation drug, on
      the dopaminergic system by using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with new
      radioligand, [11C]-(+)-PHNO. The investigators primary hypothesis is that chronic varenicline
      administration will increase dopamine (DA) receptors levels ([11C](+)PHNO) within the human
      brain.

      Subjects will undergo a pre-treatment PET and MRI scans for baseline [11C](+)PHNO measures on
      Day 1. Subjects will subsequently be provided an initial 2-week supply of study medications
      (varenicline) and directions for use. Any adverse events, compliance to medication and
      smoking patterns will be noted during these two weeks. Varenicline will be used at the same
      dosage regimen as used for smoking cessation. After subjects go through a post-treatment PET
      and MRI scans on Day 10, they will be instructed to set up a quit date. There will then be
      follow-up visits every 2 weeks for the duration of the medication phase (3 months total) and
      a visit at 6 months follow-up.

             surgical clips, skull plate, certain part of dental braces) or implanted electronic
             devices (e.g. cardiac pacemaker, neurostimulator), that preclude safe MR scanning.
