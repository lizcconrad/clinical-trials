  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of maternal overweight and obesity has nearly doubled in the United States
      since 1976. In 2004-2005, 42% of pregnant women had body mass index (BMI) above 25 versus 23%
      in 1993. Most American women are overweight/ obese (OW/OB) at conception, especially within
      certain racial, ethnic, and lower socioeconomic groups leading to increased adverse maternal
      and birth outcomes. This study will recruit, randomize and test in 300 ethnically diverse
      OW/OB pregnant women a behavioral intervention aimed at controlling gestational weight gain
      (GWG) through recommended diet, activity and lifestyle changes that are to be maintained
      postpartum. Outcomes include anthropometric (height, weight, percent body fat) metabolic
      (blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipids and C-reactive protein) and
      behavioral measures (diet. physical activity, sleep and stress). In addition, babies will be
      measured for length, weight and percent body fat. The goal is to limit excessive gestational
      weight gain through improved maternal lifestyle that can be maintained and modelled for the
      family post partum and beyond.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Randomized Control Trial is planned among ethnically diverse OW/OB pregnant women ages
      18-45 years to be randomly assigned to the MOMFIT Active Intervention Group (AIG) or the
      Educational Control Group (ECG) plus standard obstetrical care. The DASH diet, along with
      moderate physical activity and group intervention as utilized in the Diabetes Prevention
      Program (DPP), will be adapted for pregnant and postpartum women through individual visits to
      tailor calorie/nutrient/activity goals, plus group coaching sessions and electronic
      self-monitoring behavior. Evidence based motivational interviewing and state of the art
      self-monitoring tools involving the Calorie King software will be adapted for
      pregnant/postpartum women via smartphone or Internet access, along with tailored feedback and
      encouragement from the Lifestyle Coach. Prevention of excessive GWG and achievement of the
      Institute Of Medicine (IOM) weight gain goals will be compared between groups, whether
      ongoing adherence to the lifestyle interventions can be sustained through postpartum
      intervention. Approximately one third of the participants are expected to be minorities
      and/or from low income backgrounds. The primary outcome is gestational weight gain from
      baseline (self-reported prepregnancy weight) to near delivery (36 weeks) compared with IOM
      goals in both groups and postpartum weight retention between 6 weeks and 12 months
      postpartum. Additional outcome variables include changes in maternal BMI and adiposity
      postpartum, blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c, CRP, and lipids, diet quality, and
      physical activity levels, offspring adiposity and anthropometrics, and glucose and C-peptide
      in cord blood
