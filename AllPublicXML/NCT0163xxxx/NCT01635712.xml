    <textblock>
      Hsp90 is a chemical in the body that is involved int he promotion of cancer. SNX-5422 is an
      experimental drug that blocks Hsp90.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SNX-5422 is a prodrug for SNX-2112. Correlation has been observed between Hsp90 client
      protein level changes and functional effects in cells in in vitro studies of SNX-2112,
      supporting inhibition of Hsp90 as the mechanism of action for this compound. SNX-5422 has
      demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of human tumors,
      including breast (BT474, MX-1), colon (HT29), prostate (PC3), and melanoma (A375) with
      multiple oral dosing regimens. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice, rats, and dogs have
      shown high bioavailability of SNX-2112 following oral administration of SNX 5422. In mouse
      xenograft studies, SNX-2112 was selectively retained in tumor tissue compared with other
      tissues. This study will employ critical risk management features including the use of the
      NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, which provides a
      scale for consistently grading the severity of AEs, toxicity criteria analyses for dose
      escalation, frequent laboratory and clinical observations, correlation of AEs with plasma
      concentrations of SNX-5422 and SNX-2112, monitoring of the QTc interval at appropriate time
      points, and a conservative dose-escalation scheme.
