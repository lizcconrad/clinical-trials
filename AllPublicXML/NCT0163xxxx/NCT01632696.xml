      Tumor Imaging of I-124 PGN65 in Solid Tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) will be enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, tumor
      imaging and dosimetry study of I-124 PGN650 in solid tumors. All eligible patients who give
      written, informed consent and meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, and
      whose laboratory results are within specified limits at the screening visit, will be
      enrolled. All study subjects will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of I-124 PGN650.
      Study subjects will have whole body PET/CT imaging at three different timepoints with all
      patients having PET/CT at 0 to 60 minutes after injection of I-124 PGN650. Study subjects
      will then be assigned to either a 3 to 5-hour or 6 to 8-hour timepoint and either an 18 to 26
      hour or 42 to 52 hour post-injection timepoint. Tumor and whole body radioactivity
      distribution will be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Signed informed consent form.

          2. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors at any stage with at least one
             lesion (primary, metastatic, or recurrent) ≥ 1.5 cm in diameter documented by CT. If
             the lesion is located in a lymph node, the shortest diameter of the lymph node must be
             ≥ 1.5 cm as defined by RECIST 1.1. (Note: See Exclusion Criteria #1.)

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          5. Adequate baseline hematological and organ function, assessed by laboratory values
             prior to study treatment as follows: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 x 109/L;
             hemoglobin &gt; 7 g/dL; serum creatinine &lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal
             (IULN); aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x IULN; alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x
             IULN; (if liver metastases are present, ALT and AST &lt; 5 x IULN); total bilirubin &lt; 1.5
             x IULN.

          6. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control, abstinence), for the duration of study participation
             (i.e., from dosing day 1 until study day 8). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          7. Patient must be willing and able to undergo the imaging studies outlined in the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Only measureable disease (primary or metastatic) is located in or near the thyroid
             gland, liver, kidney, or urinary bladder.

          2. Medical conditions such as ischemic heart or lung disease that may be considered an
             unacceptable risk.

          3. Females who are lactating or pregnant.

          4. Persistent acute toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapy.

          5. History of hypersensitivity to iodine.

          6. Known bladder outlet obstruction.

          7. Any condition that would in the Investigator's judgment prevents compliance with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          8. Patients with known history of an autoimmune disease- including but not limited to:
             celiac disease, Crohn's disease, dermatomyositis, Grave's disease, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
