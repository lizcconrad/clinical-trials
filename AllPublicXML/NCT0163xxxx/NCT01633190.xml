      -  Rotavirus Hospital Admissions Surveillance

        -  Retrospective surveillance for 2010 and 2011 for hospital admissions in children aged 0
           to 16 years due to rotavirus gastroenteritis will be completed by all centers of the
           IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program, ACTive) pediatric hospital network.

        -  Prospective surveillance of rotavirus-related admissions for children aged 0 to 16 years
           was conducted in 2012-14 inclusive and will be performed for an additional three years,
           2015, 2016 and 2017 at all 12 sites. Surveillance methodology will continue using the
           same case-finding strategy and the same case report form as in past surveillance (Case
           reporting is done electronically.

        -  Emergency Department Burden of Disease Case finding for all-cause diarrheal illness
           using ICD codes was undertaken prospectively for 2012 to 2014 and will not continue in
           the years 2015-17 inclusive. Systematic stool sampling was carried out for cases of
           gastroenteritis in children &lt; 5 years of age presenting to the ED departments at the
           IMPACT hospitals in 2012 and 2013 and 5 of the 12 center hospitals in 2014. This
           component will not continue in to the 2015-17 protocol study years. However the admitted
           cases presenting to the IMPACT center hospitals with positive rotavirus will be reported
           and stool samples saved for genotyping at a later date.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has the ability to provide contemporary Canadian data on the two of the most
      important outcome measures for effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine: hospital admissions and
      emergency department visits. The extended time period that already exists prior to vaccine
      implementation (2005 to 2017) will provide longterm baseline data with which to compare
      disease burden from 2012 to 2019.

      The major advantages to this study are that surveillance occurs at the same hospitals and the
      same methodology and CRF has been used since 2005. This will ensure reliability and
      consistency in the surveillance study. The national data set captures patients from age group
      0 to 16 years in 12 centers across the country. The retrospective and prospective studies
      will be in a unique position to capture all children admitted to the 12 pediatric hospitals
      in Canada. Since reliance on discharge codes alone may underestimate gastroenteritis due to
      rotavirus, laboratory surveillance coupled with medical record review will ensure the
      complete capture of the true disease burden. Data on the health status of children will
      facilitate the evaluation of children who are medically fragile for which rotavirus
      infections may be more significant.

        There are two parts to this criteria- Hospital admission surveillance (to December 31,
        2019; and genotype surveillance (to December 31, 2019)

        Hospital admission surveillance:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 0 to 16 years of age.

          -  Inpatient status at the IMPACT hospital

             the use of antigen detection methods (enzyme linked immunoassay [ELISA] or
             immunochromatographic methods) or electron microscopy or molecular (PCR) diagnosis in
             a stool specimen taken within 14 days after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms.
             Cases identified by autopsy must have had gastrointestinal symptoms before death.

             institution using the same criteria as above

        Exclusion criteria
