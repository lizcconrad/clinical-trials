    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a replicable, psychologically-based
      group education intervention, Re-Inventing Yourself after Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), which
      aims to enhance personal self-efficacy. A structured six-week, manualized, group therapy
      intervention that delivers positive psychology concepts within a cognitive-behavioral
      therapy-based model has been created for the purpose of developing a resilient and optimistic
      sense of efficacy for people with SCI. Concepts covered within this intervention include:
      reframing and restructuring a person's method of looking at events, building confidence by
      focusing on personal strengths, developing methods of recognizing and appreciating the good
      in one's life and expressing gratitude for positive attributes. The goals of this
      intervention are to increase personal self-efficacy, enhance emotional well-being and improve
      participation in society for people with SCI living in the community. The investigators
      hypothesize that persons receiving the intervention will demonstrate improved SCI-specific
      and overall self-efficacy as compared to waitlist controls.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MSES is a 16 item self-report measure of self-efficacy related to everyday life activities, designed specifically for persons with SCI. Individuals use a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very uncertain) to 7 (very certain) to rate their ability to perform 16 everyday tasks, with higher scores representing greater perceived self-efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) is a questionnaire designed to assess a person's ability to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life, with ten items scored using a Likert rating scale, ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (exactly true).</description>

    <description>This group will receive 6 instructor-led 2 hour long didactic presentations regarding 8 key principles of self-efficacy and experiential exercises, including goal setting and problem solving with extensive group discussion. At the end of each session, tasks are assigned to participants to be completed outside the group during the week between sessions. Experiences from these activities and practice implementing the intervention principles will be shared and discussed each week, providing additional opportunities for problem solving and positive feedback.</description>

    <description>The intervention involves participation in a six week psychologically-based educational intervention. During the course, 8 specific skills are reviewed in order to specifically address reframing a person's method of looking at events, build confidence by focusing on personal strengths, develop methods of recognizing and appreciating the good in one's life and express gratitude for positive attributes. These skills are presented in a specific sequence so that participants can gain mastery of introductory concepts before undertaking those that are both more difficult and complex.</description>

             interactions; and

          5. able to provide informed consent to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury;

          2. current participation in another RCT;

          3. live beyond a reasonable commuting distance from Craig Hospital;

          4. unable to verbally communicate;

          7. are currently experiencing moderately severe or greater levels of depression which
             would require more intense treatment than is provided in this intervention, as
             evidenced by a score of 15 or higher on the Personal Health Questionnaire-9;37

          8. are currently of high self efficacy, as determined by a score of 90 or higher on the
