      Hypofractionated radiotherapy reduce the patient and family burden through decreasing the
      overall treatment time. This study is to evaluate the clinical end results of the
      hypofractionated radiotherapy in DIPG compared to the conventional treatment. The
      non-inferiority of the hypofractionated radiotherapy will result in decrease the hospital,
      stay or engagement, for more than its half with the same results.

    <textblock>
      In lack of open study protocols aiming to increase cure rate in pediatric diffuse intrinsic
      pontine glioma (DIPG), the investigators examined a hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen up
      to a dose of 39Gy in 13 fractions, completed in 2.5-3 weeks, instead of 6 weeks.

      This schedule offers a reduction in patient burden, especially preferable in children with a
      poor compliance and performance status. The non-inferiority of the hypofractionated regimen
      in its clinical end-results, with the reduction of the overall treatment time to less than
      its half will decrease the burden for the patient, his/her family and the treating
      department. This will be considered as added value without compromising the survival or
      increasing side effects.
