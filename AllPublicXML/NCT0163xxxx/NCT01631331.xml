      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effect of vismodegib on sporadic basal cell
      carcinoma (BCCs) prior to surgical removal.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The percent reduction in surgical defect area/size surrounding BCC tumor pre and
      post-vismodegib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Recurrence rate post treatment II. Safety, tolerability and percent drop-out after 3 vs. 6
      months of vismodegib in otherwise healthy patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 3 months if the initial BCC
      size is &lt; 2 cm and superficial or for up to 6 months if the initial BCC size is &gt;= 2 cm or
      non-superficial. After completion of vismodegib treatment, patients undergo Mohs surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for an average of 24 months.

    <time_frame>average of 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, we selected 1 to 2 tumors per patient for surgery (13 target tumors selected). At baseline,1 Mohs surgeon measured the estimated surgical defect area around the target tumor. For tumors to be excised by Mohs we defined estimated surgical defect as the tumor size plus a 2-mm circumferential margin, presuming tumor clearance after a Mohs stage-1 excision. For the tumor undergoing standard (non-Mohs) excision, we used tumor size plus a standard 4-mm margin11 for the estimated surgical defect. On the day of the surgery, we measured the surgical defect area as the final tumor-free defect after the Mohs procedure or non-Mohs excision immediately before closure. We used the Image J software program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to calculate tumor area (cm2). Only target tumors are included in this analysis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study patients must have at least one BCC, &gt; 5 mm, eligible for Mohs surgical removal;
             patients with BCCs that have been treated before (recurrent BCCs, BCCs that failed
             other chemotherapy) are eligible for this trial, if they meet size criteria

          -  No Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or Karnofsky performance status will be
             employed

          -  Normal hepatic function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) =&lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Normal renal function : normal serum creatinine defined as &lt;= 2.5 mg/dL

          -  Clinically acceptable complete blood count (CBC)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  The patient is willing to forego surgical treatment of BCCs by up to 6 months, except
             when the principal investigator (PI) believes that delay in treatment potentially
             might compromise the health of the subject

          -  Documented negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, with
             agreement to the use of two acceptable methods of contraception during the study and
             for 7 months after discontinuation of vismodegib

          -  For men with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a latex,
             non-latex, or any other male condom and to advise their female partners to use an
             additional acceptable method of birth control during the study and for 2 months after
             discontinuation of study drug

          -  Be willing to not donate blood or semen for three months following discontinuation of
             study medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a history of invasive cancer within the past five years excluding
             non-melanoma skin cancer, stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the
             breast, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stage 0

          -  The subject has uncontrolled systemic disease, including known human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) positive patients:

               -  The patient has history of congestive heart failure

               -  The patient has clinically important history of liver disease, including viral or
                  hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

               -  The patient has any condition or situation which in the investigator's opinion
                  may put the patient at significant risk, could confound the study results, or
                  could interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study; this
                  includes history of other skin conditions or disease, metabolic dysfunction,
                  physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable
                  suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an
                  investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the
                  study or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications

          -  The patient has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study
             medication formulations

          -  The patient is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical medications to
             the skin for the duration of the study, including prescription and over the counter
             preparations; for example, topical preparations containing corticosteroids or vitamin
             A derivatives are not allowed

          -  Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study

        <description>At baseline, we selected 1 to 2 tumors per patient for surgery (13 target tumors selected). At baseline,1 Mohs surgeon measured the estimated surgical defect area around the target tumor. For tumors to be excised by Mohs we defined estimated surgical defect as the tumor size plus a 2-mm circumferential margin, presuming tumor clearance after a Mohs stage-1 excision. For the tumor undergoing standard (non-Mohs) excision, we used tumor size plus a standard 4-mm margin11 for the estimated surgical defect. On the day of the surgery, we measured the surgical defect area as the final tumor-free defect after the Mohs procedure or non-Mohs excision immediately before closure. We used the Image J software program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to calculate tumor area (cm2). Only target tumors are included in this analysis.</description>
