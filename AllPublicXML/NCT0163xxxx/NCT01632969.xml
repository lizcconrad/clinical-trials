  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care provided for head and neck cancer
      patients. By better understanding the end of life experiences of dying patients and their
      families, the investigators hope to better anticipate and improve upon the experiences of
      future patients and their families.

    <description>To determine the perception of the family members of the quality of care received by patients with aerodigestive mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck at the end of their lives. A survey will be administered to the families and next-of-kin of deceased patients. A recently validated survey instrument, the Family Assessment of Treatment at the End of life (FATE), is designed to assess treatment at the end of life based upon the responses of family members of the deceased (Finlay, Shreve et al. 2008).</description>

        Deceased Head and Neck Surgery patients will be queried from Dataline and screened for

        MSKCC for noncutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract will be
        conducted via telephone, employing the survey instruments.
