  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of selected Osteopathic Manipulative
      Medicine (OMM) techniques on the respiratory system of people with Parkinson's Disease (PD)
      in comparison to light touch. Effectiveness will be measured through pulmonary function
      tests, chest wall expansion, and voice analysis. Selected subjects will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two groups: OMM treatment group or light touch group. Although OMM treatment
      has been used on PD patients, a randomized controlled study has not been done to establish
      its effect on PD respiratory function. The authors believe that this study will show OMM's
      effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) on the thoracic cage and diaphragm is commonly used
      in clinical practice to address myofascial imbalances, including muscle spasms to improve
      thoracic cage excursion. Prior research has demonstrated that manual approaches applied to
      the thoracic cage have positive results with lung function and reducing inflammation.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disabling and progressive neuro-degenerative disorder.
      Morbidity and mortality are frequently associated with pulmonary dysfunction in patients with
      PD. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) have been utilized to document respiratory impairment in
      PD patients. Researchers estimate that 89% of people with PD have speech and voice disorders
      including disorders of laryngeal, respiratory and articulatory function.

      These authors hypothesize that performing OMM on the thoracic cage of PD subjects will show
      improvement in PFT, chest expansion, and speech production. Subjects with PD meeting the
      criteria for the study will be randomly assigned to either an OMM treatment or light touch
      control group. Each subject will be involved in one treatment visit. During this visit, the
      following will be measured before and after OMM or light touch procedures: maximal and
      minimal chest circumference; sound pressure, duration, and perceptual measures during
      sustained vowel phonation and Rainbow Reading; Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory
      Volume/1 second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Forced Expiratory Flow 25%-75%
      (FEF25-75%), and Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). Data analysis will be performed with
      SPSS using Analysis of Covariance to measure significance.
