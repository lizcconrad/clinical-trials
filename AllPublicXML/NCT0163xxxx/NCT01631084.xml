    <textblock>
      In this demonstration project (Asia Pacific JADE and DIAMOND Program, AP-JD in short)
      supported by the Asia Diabetes Foundation (ADF), patients will be recruited from different
      sites across Asia, with each site recruiting at least 600 type 2 diabetic patients. After
      explanation by trained doctors and nurses, and with written informed consent, patients will
      be randomized to either the JADE (n=300, structured care) or DIAMOND (n=300, usual care)
      group.

      All patients will undergo a comprehensive assessment (CA) at baseline and yearly thereafter.
      Patients in the JADE group will be further managed by a doctor-nurse-HCA team according to a
      protocol based on risk stratification with predefined follow up (FU) schedules together with
      shared information and decision support (i.e. structured collaborative care). The DIAMOND
      protocol involves only baseline and yearly CA without predefined FU schedules or feedback of
      information between CA visits (i.e. usual care).

      The primary composite endpoint is all-diabetes related clinical endpoints. The secondary
      composite endpoint is attainment of treatment goals and/or control of risk factors. The
      tertiary changes are behavioral changes, psychological well being and quality of life.

      Rationale: Change of practice environment and an interdisciplinary team is needed to
      implement evidence-based diabetes care which requires risk stratification, periodic
      assessments, education and treatment to targets.

      Hypothesis: The use of a web-based disease management program (Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation
      (JADE) Program) delivered by a doctor-nurse-HCA team reduces the incidence of all
      diabetes-associated clinical endpoint and improves control of risk factors compared to usual
      care (DIAbetes MONitoring Database (DIAMOND) group) in type 2 diabetes.

      Objective: To compare structured care using the JADE portal versus usual care using the
      DIAMOND portal on incidence of all-diabetes related events, physical and psychological
      health.

      Study design: A multicentre, randomized, integrated disease management program Setting and
      patients: 600 patients from each site will be randomized to the JADE group (n=300) or the
      DIAMOND group (n=300) and followed up for at least 24 months.

      Intervention: All patients will undergo comprehensive assessment (CA) guided by the templates
      in the respective portal at baseline, month 12 and 24. The JADE group will be further managed
      by a doctor-nurse-HCA team guided by the JADE portal with risk stratification program and
      recommendation to different care protocols with predefined follow up (FU) schedules,
      information sharing and decision supports.

      Outcome measures: Primary composite outcomes include all diabetes-related clinical events;
      secondary composite outcomes include control of risk factors and tertiary composite outcomes
      include behavioral changes, psychological health, quality of life and cost-effective
      analysis.

    <description>Patients randomized to the JADE group will be followed according to protocol-driven diabetes care based on their individual risk levels, using a web-based disease management program. In addition to their annual comprehensive assessments at baseline, year 1 and year 2, all subsequent follow-up visits will be documented and entered into the JADE portal, which will then issue reports to both patients and doctor to promote sharing of information and informed decisions.</description>

    <description>Patients are booked for reviews led by the doctor-nurse-HCA team every 2-4 months, preferably in a setting different from the busy clinics in order to facilitate group education and promote peer support.
Between each follow-up visit, the nurse or HCA will contact the patient by phone or email to remind them of the appointments (e.g. medical FU visit or laboratory tests), adhere to medications and healthy lifestyles, perform self glucose monitoring and provide psychosocial support, as appropriate.</description>
