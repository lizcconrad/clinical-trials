    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a new blood test can help the doctor determine if
      there is brain injury or ischemia. Ischemia occurs when not enough oxygen gets to the brain.
      In this study the investigators are analyzing your blood for a new test that might help
      doctors decide if symptoms are from a neurologic problem.

      We will compare a new blood test with routine tests that the doctor will order as part of
      your normal care. This study will measure new biomarkers (biomarker is a specific
      distinguishing feature used to measure or indicate the effects or progress of a disease or
      condition) of neurologic stress called xanthine, hypoxanthine, and inosine. Blood will be
      drawn as a part of the study to measure these biomarker levels in your blood. This blood will
      be analyzed i the laboratory at VCU and possibly at a future date at another institution. No
      names will be associated with the blood sample
