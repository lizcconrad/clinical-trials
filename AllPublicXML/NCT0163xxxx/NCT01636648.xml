  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, non-interventional post-market study.
      The study was a post-market long-term follow-up study based on the same cohort of patients
      (148 patients) enrolled in a previous investigational study from March 2007 to December 2009
      (ATS 3f Enable™ Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 6000, number S2005) involving 10 European sites.
      Patient follow-up took place on a yearly basis up to 10 years after the implant/enrollment.
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Medtronic ATS Enable Aortic Bioprosthesis during long-term follow-up.

      As this was an observational study, safety and efficacy data were summarized and described.
      There was no statistically powered study hypothesis.
