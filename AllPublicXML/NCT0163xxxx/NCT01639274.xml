  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved survival of
      HIV-infected patients. Opportunist diseases and cancers linked to immunodepression have
      largely regressed. Challenge is now the management of cardio-vascular diseases, nephrologic,
      neurologic, osteo-articular diseases, chronic hepatitis and cancer no linked to
      immunodepression. All this comorbidities are more reported in HIV-infected patients than in
      general non-HIV infected patients. Those are directly linked to the effect of chronic
      HIV-infection on ageing, metabolic effects of HAART, and way of life characterising this
      population.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from tobacco consumption. Bronchial
      chronic infection, immunity, and ageing are also involved in the physiopathology of COPD.
      This disease has never been evaluated in a large prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients
      whereas there is a known increase of tobacco consumption and pulmonary infection in this
      population regardless to the general population.

      Characterisation of COPD disease in HIV patients will allow us to make an hypothetic
      epidemiological link between HIV- HAART and COPD independently of tobacco consumption, and to
      study different physiopathologic hypothesis evocated in COPD genesis, like an accelerate
      pulmonary ageing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of HIV is mainly represented by its commorbidities (cardio-vascular disease,
      nephrologic, neurologic, osteo-articular disease, chronic hepatitis and cancer no linked to
      immunodepression). COPD prevalence has never been studied in HIV population. In consequence,
      there is no guideline about the screening, treatment or follow-up of COPD in HIV patients.
      However this population seems particularly at risk to develop COPD because of high tobacco
      consumption and accelerate ageing. Thus, we need an epidemiologic study to understand the
      prevalence of COPD in HIV population in order to organize a specific screening and follow-up.
      This is supported by an improvement of COPD if early managed. On top of that, COPD screening
      will increase awareness of HIV patients on the problematic of tobacco consumption.

    <description>An auto-questionnaire will be given to each patient included in the study (concern respiratory symptoms, tobacco consummation, illicit drug use, various respiratory exposition and lifestyle). Each patient will release a rapid evaluation of respiratory capacity with COPD-6. Patients screened with abnormal respiratory symptoms on auto-questionnaire, or with a risk of COPD ranked from high to moderate by COPD-6 test will benefit of a conventional spirometry.</description>
