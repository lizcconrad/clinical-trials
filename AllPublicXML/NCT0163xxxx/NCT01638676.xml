  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Vemurafenib in combination with
      Metformin in melanoma patients. The phase II part of the study will also evaluate the
      clinical activity of the combined regiment. Based on pre-clinical studies and a phase I
      trial, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of an FDA-approved non-toxic dose
      of oral Metformin with Vemurafenib will yield little toxicity and improve clinical outcomes
      in terms of objective response rates and survival in metastatic melanoma patients.

      This is a Phase I/II study. Phase I will be evaluating the safety of the FDA-approved
      Vemurafenib (960 mg orally, daily) in combination with Metformin (500 mg orally, twice daily
      for 2 weeks, then 850 mg orally,twice daily) in patients with unresectable Stage IIIC and
      Stage IV melanoma. Phase II will evaluate the clinical activity of the combined
      Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen. The safety profile of this combined Vemurafenib/Metformin
      regimen will be monitored during both phases. The treatment period consists of 28-day cycles
      until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
