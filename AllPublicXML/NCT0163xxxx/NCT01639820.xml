    <textblock>
      Patients with early cervical cancer are usually treated with radical hysterectomy + pelvic
      lymph-node dissection. The study randomizes patients in 2 arms. The control arm is the
      classical surgical treatment including identification of the sentinel nodes, full pelvic
      lymph-node dissection and radical hysterectomy.

      The experimental arm is only sentinel node identification + radical hysterectomy.
