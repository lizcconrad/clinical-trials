  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability; and to determine
      the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CHR-2797 in normal healthy male subjects.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, open-label, 2-arm, 2-way, crossover trial to assess the effect
      of food on CHR-2797 PK following a single 120 mg dose. Approximately 18 normal, healthy male
      subjects will be enrolled with at least 12 subjects completing the study. Two 60 mg capsules
      will be administered for a 120 mg dose of CHR-2797 on Days 1 and 8 with a high-fat meal or in
      the fasted state according to the randomization schedule. Subjects will be confined at the
      clinical research unit (CRU) from the time of Period 1 Check-in until Clinic Discharge on Day
      3, and will return to the CRU on Day 7 for Period 2 Check-in and remain in the CRU until
      Study Completion (on Day 10 of Period 2). Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected
      through 48 hours post dose.

          3. In good health, determined by no clinically significant ongoing diseases or other
             conditions that require medication, and/or any other findings from medical history,
             physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs.
