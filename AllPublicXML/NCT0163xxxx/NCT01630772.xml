      The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence that has a physical therapy protocol in
      maternal and fetal hemodynamics in relation to blood pressure, maternal and fetal responses
      and perinatal outcomes.

      The hypertensive disorders in pregnancy affecting 5-8% of pregnant women worldwide,
      contributing significantly to maternal and fetal complications. Various forms of hypertensive
      disorders occurring during pregnancy, including preeclampsia and chronic hypertension with
      superimposed preeclampsia. These two disorders present with high blood pressure and
      proteinuria, and often lead to the hospitalization of pregnant women.

      The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a physical therapy protocol used in
      pregnant women with preeclampsia on blood pressure, maternal-fetal outcomes and perinatal
      outcomes.

      Participants in the study pregnant women with preeclampsia and hypertension with superimposed
      pre-eclampsia, hospitalized, with no significant complications that may impair the normal
      course of pregnancy. All pregnant women are monitored through laboratory and clinical data
      and the fetus monitored by tests that assessed their vitality, in addition, pregnant women in
      the intervention group performed the proposed physiotherapeutic the study protocol.
