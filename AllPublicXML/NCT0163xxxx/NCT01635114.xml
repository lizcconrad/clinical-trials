      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the antioxidant &quot;resveratrol&quot; on
      liver fat content, body-composition and insulin sensitivity

      Resveratrol is found in grape skin, wine, peanuts, and mulberries and is thought to have
      health benefits such as improving fat metabolism, insulin action, and possibly extending
      lifespan. resVida™ is the name for the dietary supplement containing the natural antioxidant
      &quot;resveratrol&quot;. resVida™ will be supplied by DSM Nutritional Products, Ltd.

      resVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by
      German Authority. It is regulated like a food. The makers of resVida™ make no claim that this
      supplement is meant to treat any ailment.

      This study is designed to investigate the health benefits of resveratrol.
