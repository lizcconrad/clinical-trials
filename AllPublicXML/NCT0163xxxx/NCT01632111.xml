    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether Agalsidase alpha, a drug commonly
      prescribed in patients with Fabry disease, is associated with improvement of the pulmonary
      involvement. According to the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the
      surrogate markers for obstructive lung diseases are a decrease in both forced expiratory
      volume in one second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC ratio, whereas FVC is the forced vital capacity.
      However, the measurement of these lung function parameters is indicated as yearly follow-up
      examinations with or without the treatment of Agalsidase alpha in patients with Fabry
      disease.

      Pulmonary function tests und DLCO measurements are performed yearly in relation with yearly
      follow up examinations in the Department of Internal Medicine from the University Hospital of
      Zurich. We will retrospectively collect the results of the pulmonary functions test
      (spirometry).
