      Although there are several tools that can be used to evaluate the severity of ongoing alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome (AWS), there is no available tool that can predict which patients are at
      risk for developing AWS at the time admission, before the patient has developed AWS.
      Unfortunately, there are severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (e.g., seizures) which may
      develop early in the hospitalization, and before the development of other systemic symptoms
      which may warn medical personnel of the possibility of impeding alcohol withdrawal (e.g.,
      autonomic instability, delirium). The goal of this study is to evaluate the psychometric
      properties (e.g., predictive validity) of a new tool, the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal
      Severity Scale (PAWSS), on identifying which patients are at risk for developing complicated
      AWS (i.e., seizures, hallucinosis, delirium tremens) among hospitalized, medically ill
      patients.

      The investigators plan to study the psychometric properties of a new tool, the &quot;Prediction of
      Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale&quot; (PAWSS) on predicting the risk for the development of
      complicated AWS (i.e., seizures, delirium tremens) in hospitalized medically ill patients.
      This tool was developed through an extensive literature review which identified
      evidence-based predictors for AWS.

      The scale consists of three portions relating to 1) an initial screening (threshold items),
      2) patient's history of alcohol use and its consequences, and 3) measures of BAL and
      autonomic function. The investigators predict that a scale score 4 or greater will be
      associated with a high risk for the development of complicated AWS.

      Patients will undergo examination with the PAWSS within 24 hours of hospital admission.
      Thereafter, all patients will undergo daily examinations with the Clinical Institute
      Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA) and the Alcohol Withdrawal Severity scale
      (AWS scale) in order to measure the primary outcomes of the study, that is, the development
      and severity (i.e., moderate to severe) of AWS during the first 72-hours after admission. The
      study is designed to study the tool's psychometric properties including its validity and
      inter-rater reliability.

      By providing clinicians with a tool (i.e., PAWSS) that allows them to correctly predict who
      will develop complicated AWS it will enable them to prophylax (i.e., preventively treat)
      patients at risk and thus decrease patients' morbidity and mortality, shorten length of
      hospital stay, minimize the significant burden on the nursing and medical staff, and improve
      overall patient care.
