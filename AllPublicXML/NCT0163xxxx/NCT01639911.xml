          7. Systemic infection requiring IV antibiotics within 14 days preceding the 1st dose of
             study drug, or other severe infection.

             not medically relevant.

          9. Pregnant or breast-feeding. Pazopanib is Pregnancy Category D - known teratogenic
             potential. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a
             negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test result
             obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or

         10. Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment

         11. Serious medical or psychiatric illness in the opinion of the researcher that would

         12. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including uncontrolled
             diabetes, malabsorption, resection of the pancreas or upper small bowel, requirement
             for pancreatic enzymes, any condition that would modify small bowel absorption of oral
             medications, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with
             study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with
             the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

         13. Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as the enzyme-inducing
             antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital, or rifampin, rifabutin,
             rifapentine or St. John's wort within 14 days prior to the first dose of alisertib and
             during the study.

         14. Treatment should be avoided (however not prohibited) with strong UGT inhibitors such
             as atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir, ketoconazole, Silybum marianum (milk thistle),
             Valeriana officinalis (garden valerian) or inducers such as carbamazepine, nicotine,
             Orthosiphon stamineus within 14 days prior to the first dose of alisertib and during
             the study.

         15. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or
             hepatitis C. Testing is not required in the absence of clinical findings or suspicion.

         16. Recent (within 6 months) arterial thromboembolic events, including transient ischemic
             attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina, or myocardial
             infarction (MI). Patients with clinically significant peripheral artery disease are
             ineligible.

         17. History of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders, not receiving chronic daily treatment
             with aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or non-steriodal anti-inflammatory agents know to inhibit
             platelet function. Treatment with dipyridamole (persantine), ticlopidine (Ticlid),
             clopidogrel (Plavix) and/or cilostazol (Pletal).

         18. Use of simvastatin is not recommended but not prohibited. The concomitant use of
             pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations. Discontinue
             simvastatin if possible to decrease risk of transaminases elevation from pazopanib.
             There are insufficient data available to assess the risk of alternative statins. If it
             must be continued, monitor liver function closely and follow dosing guidelines.

               -  &gt; grade 1 diarrhea

               -  Major resection of stomach or small bowel

         21. Inability to swallow oral medications or inability to take nothing by mouth except
             water and prescribed medications for 2 hours before and 2 hours after each dose of
             alisertib.

         22. Abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) considered by the investigator to be
             clinical significant or baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (e.g.,
             repeated demonstration of QTc interval &gt; 450 milliseconds)

         23. Poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg
             or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 90mmHg]. Note: Initiation or adjustment of
             antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. The mean SBP / DBP
             values from each blood pressure assessment must be &lt; 140/90mmHg in order for a subject
             to be eligible for the study.

         24. History of cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous
             thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have

             eligible. Patients receiving Coumadin must be transition to low molecular weight
             heparin and treated for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

         25. Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of study drug

         26. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis

         27. Known endobronchial lesions or involvement of large pulmonary vessels by tumor or
             centrally located pulmonary cavitating lesion

             of study drug

         29. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications list in Section 6.5
