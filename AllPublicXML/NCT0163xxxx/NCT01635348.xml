  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare two different exercise treatments for
      walking problems in older adults. The investigators want to determine if participation in the
      exercise programs will improve walking and thinking abilities.

      Specific Aims We will examine the impact of moderate intensity aerobic and of motor skill
      exercise interventions on improving gait and cognition in older adults with slow gait and
      psychomotor slowing. In a thrice weekly, 12 week, randomized clinical trial, we propose the
      following aims: 1) to define the impact of moderate intensity aerobic and motor skill gait
      exercise on thinking while walking, and 2) to define the impact of moderate intensity aerobic
      and motor skill gait exercise on gait and cognition. Brief Background The optimal exercise to
      improve gait and brain health in older adults is not known. Two types of exercise with
      potential for affects on gait and brain health, aerobic and motor skill exercise, developed
      out of distinct disciplines and have been studied separately, but not in older adults with
      the same age-related, centrally-generated slow gait dysfunction or for their effects on an
      integrated measure of gait and cognition, 'walking while thinking'. Summary of Methods We
      propose two parallel, single arm clinical trials to define the impact of aerobic and
      motor-skill exercise on gait and cognitive functions, in community-dwelling older adults with
      slow gait and psychomotor slowing, randomly assigned to moderate intensity aerobic gait
      (n=12) or motor skill gait (n=12) exercise, three times a week, for 12 weeks, in small groups
      of 2-3 supervised by a physical therapist. Primary outcomes are integrated measures of
      thinking while walking, with secondary outcomes of specific measures of gait and cognitive
      function collected pre, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post interventions, to examine impact of exercise
      and dose-response effects on gait and cognition. Future Use of Data The intent of the
      proposed pilot is to generate complementary data essential to support an R01 clinical trial
      grant submission. Specifically in this pilot we will: 1) recruit older adults with both slow
      gait speed and evidence of psychomotor slowing, 2) explore and define a primary outcome
      measure that integrates both gait and cognition, and thus better represents the goal of the
      exercise interventions - thinking while walking, 3) determine potential mean and variability
      estimates for gait and cognitive outcomes, particularly the less well-characterized gait
      outcomes of aerobic exercise (energy expenditure for walking, gait variability, gait
      abnormalities), and cognitive outcomes of motor skill exercise (speed of processing,
      executive function).

    <description>The motor skill gait exercise is a task-oriented motor sequence learning approach to exercise to improve walking. The approach involves goal-directed stepping and walking patterns to facilitate use of the appropriate muscles at the appropriate timing relative to body position during gait through the task performance. Treadmill-assisted walking in brief intervals of small increased speed walking interspersed with usual walking speed are performed to induce the automatic rhythm and timing of gait. The exercise sessions are about 60 minutes, 2-3 times a week for 12 weeks or a total of 30-36 sessions.</description>

    <description>The aerobic gait intervention approach involves treadmill and overground walking with the gradual increases in the distance walked and speed of walking. The exercise approach provides walking practice, including on the treadmill to facilitate the timing of stepping during gait, while also facilitating a fitness or conditioning response, and endurance for walking activities. The exercise sessions are about 60 minutes, 2-3 times weekly for 12 weeks, or about 30-36 sessions.</description>
