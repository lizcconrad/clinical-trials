  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to determine the feasibility to combine standard
      chemotherapy (Carbo/Caelyx or doxorubicin) for recurrent ovarian cancer with immunotherapy
      (Tocilizumab and Peg-Intron).

      This study combines standard chemotherapy Carboplatin-Caelyx or doxorubicin with a monoclonal
      antibody against IL-6R (tocilizumab). High IL-6 levels correlate with poor prognosis and
      chemoresistance in ovarian cancer patients. In cases of chemoresistant ovarian cancer,
      therefore, modulation of the IL-6 pathway, by blocking the IL-6 receptor, may represent a
      promising strategy to both abolish drug resistance and amplify host immunity in patients with
      recurrent ovarian cancer. Blockade of the IL-6/IL-6R pathway may enhance immunogenic cell
      death and restore local normal DC maturation. In addition, the use of interferon-alpha
      (Peg-Intron) allows the full maturation of DC, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor response.
