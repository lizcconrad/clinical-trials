  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical studies propose to study the abuse-related effects of nicotine after
      progesterone administration during the follicular phase in women of reproductive age.
      Concurrent analysis of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormones should help to clarify the
      role of the HPA axis in the abuse-related effects of nicotine.

      These clinical studies will analyze the interactions between progesterone, nicotine,
      alterations in endocrine hormones, mood and cardiovascular measures. The studies also intend
      to examine the contribution of menstrual cycle phase. It is hypothesized that this novel
      focus on nicotine's rapid hormonal, cardiovascular and subjective effects will be important
      for developing novel biologic approaches to treatment for nicotine abuse and dependence as
      well as advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine reinforcement.

    <description>Two doses of nicotine will be utilized in the study: a commercially available, high-yield nicotine cigarette (Marlboro Red; Phillip Morris brand) and a denicotinized cigarette (Murty Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lexington, KY). The high dose cigarettes contain 15.48 mg of nicotine and 16 mg of tar based on analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH, 1998). The low nicotine cigarettes contain 1.1 mg of nicotine and deliver 0.1 mg of nicotine and 2.8 mg of tar based on analyses provided by the manufacturer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15 cigarettes every
             day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence will be
             eligible for participation.

          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and
             physical examination supervised by Dr. Arthur Siegel (Chief of Internal Medicine).

          -  Absence of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders other than nicotine dependence (305.10) as measured
             by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID).

          -  Routine laboratory blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN and
             creatinine, liver function tests, hepatitis panel and urinalysis will be performed.
             Laboratory parameters must be within the normal range. HBsAg must be negative but
             subjects who have hepatitis serology consistent with previous exposure to Hepatitis A,
             Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C, but who do not have clinical and biochemical evidence of
             acute infection, will be acceptable.

          -  Hematocrit levels ≥ 35% for females.

          -  Serum pregnancy test (hCG beta subunit) results must be negative within 24 hrs of the
             study session day.

          -  Normal EKG.

          -  A Body Mass Index (BMI—ratio of weight (W) to height (H) squared; W/H2=kg/m2) of
             between 18.0 and 27.0 for women.

          -  Subjects must be able to read and understand instructions, as well as provide a valid
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with any lifetime DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than nicotine dependence.

          -  Participants with clinically significant medical disorders.

          -  Women who are pregnant as determined by laboratory testing for serum beta hCG.

          -  Women who use hormonal contraceptive medications will not be accepted, because this
             would confound the hormonal measures.

          -  Women with a mean BMI of outside the range 18.0-27.0.

          -  Participants who describe themselves as seeking treatment will not be selected but
             will be referred to local smoking cessation programs.

          -  Subjects with peanut/peanut oil allergies will be excluded.

          -  Participants diagnosed with lactose intolerance will be excluded.
