  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify differences in craniofacial morphology and tongue
      size between patients who have a history of difficult airway management and a control group
      of patients who had an uneventful airway management during induction of general anesthesia.
      In this study the investigators want to validate the hypothesis that there are craniofacial
      phenotypic differences between patients who have a history of difficult airway management and
      a control group of patients who have had an uneventful airway management during the induction
      of general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficult airway management is one of the most challenging tasks for anesthesiologists.
      Recent data from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Management Closed Claims
      Project [1] show that the percentage of claims resulting from adverse respiratory events,
      though on the decline (42% in the 1980s to 32% in the 1990s), continue to constitute a large
      source of morbidity and mortality in anesthetized patients. In 2005, a closed claims analysis
      of trends in anesthesia-related death and brain damage between 1975 and 2000 showed that out
      of all respiratory events (n=503) responsible for death and brain damage, difficult
      endotracheal intubation (n=115), inadequate oxygenation (n=111) and inadvertent esophageal
      intubation (n=66) were the top three causes [2].

    <measure>Mean Hyomental Distance Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>end of study approximately one year</time_frame>
    <description>A curved low-frequency transducer and a Flex focul 400 ultrasound system were used to visualize the tongue and shadows of the hyoid bone and mandible. Midsagittal and coronal/transverse scans from the ultrasound were analyzed using ImageJ. The hyomental distances in the neutral and heal-extended positions were measured from the upper border of the hyoid bone to the lower border of the mentum. The ratio is defined as the ratio of the hyomental distance at the extreme of head extension to that in the neutral position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Tongue Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>end of study approximately one year</time_frame>
    <description>The midsagittal scans were used to measure the cross-sectional area of the tongue. Transverse scans obtained in the midsection of the tongue (at the glossal end of the genioglossus muscle) provided a measure of the tongue width, which was measured between the most distant points on its upper surface. The tongue volume was derived from the multiplication of the midsagittal cross-sectional area by the tongue width.</description>

          <title>Mean Hyomental Distance Ratio</title>
          <description>A curved low-frequency transducer and a Flex focul 400 ultrasound system were used to visualize the tongue and shadows of the hyoid bone and mandible. Midsagittal and coronal/transverse scans from the ultrasound were analyzed using ImageJ. The hyomental distances in the neutral and heal-extended positions were measured from the upper border of the hyoid bone to the lower border of the mentum. The ratio is defined as the ratio of the hyomental distance at the extreme of head extension to that in the neutral position.</description>

        <title>Mean Tongue Volume</title>
        <description>The midsagittal scans were used to measure the cross-sectional area of the tongue. Transverse scans obtained in the midsection of the tongue (at the glossal end of the genioglossus muscle) provided a measure of the tongue width, which was measured between the most distant points on its upper surface. The tongue volume was derived from the multiplication of the midsagittal cross-sectional area by the tongue width.</description>
