  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide 200 million adults annually undergo major noncardiac surgery and 5 million of these
      patients will suffer a major vascular complication. Despite the magnitude of this problem our
      capacity to predict these events is limited. Although perioperative myocardial infarction
      (MI) is the most common major perioperative cardiac complication, little is known about its
      pathophysiology. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a potential non-invasive
      method for the detection of coronary artery disease and cardiac risk stratification in the
      non-operative setting; however, the value of this test to enhance risk prediction among
      patients scheduled for noncardiac surgery is unknown. This study is an international
      prospective cohort study to determine among patients with, or at risk of, atherosclerotic
      disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgery: 1) if preoperative coronary CTA has additional
      predictive value for the occurrence of major perioperative cardiac events and 2) the
      underlying coronary anatomy associated with perioperative MIs.
