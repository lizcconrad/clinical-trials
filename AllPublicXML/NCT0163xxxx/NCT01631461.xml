    <textblock>
      Painful breastfeeding is one of the most common reasons for early weaning. Persistent pain
      associated with breastfeeding can sometimes be difficult to diagnose and is a source of
      frustration for the breastfeeding women as well as for healthcare providers.

      The diagnosis of candida infection in breastfeeding women is generally based on signs and
      symptoms identified in case reports and without any culture. Breastfeeding pain has been
      described as superficial or deep in some studies. This deep pain syndrome as caused by
      candida or bacteria has been questioned. A few studies have cultured breast milk from women
      with deep breast pain and found Candida albicans infections or bacterial infections usually
      caused by Staphylococcus aureus. There still remains controversy and lack of evidence for
      candidiasis affecting the lactating breast as well as bacteria causing the pain. Ensured
      diagnostic methods are important due to the resistant problem with both antibiotics and
      antifungals. Only one study has described five key symptoms associated with candida. It was
      shiny, flaky nipple/areola, burning pain on the nipple/areola, non-stabbing pain or stabbing
      pain in the breast.

      The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of candida and bacteria in
      women with superficial or deep breastfeeding pain and to identify signs and symptoms linked
      to candida or bacteria in breast milk and nipple/areola.
