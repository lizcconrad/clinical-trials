  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the core symptoms, children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder
      (ASD) often exhibit disruptive behavior problems including irritability, tantrums,
      noncompliance, and aggression. This is a pilot study of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, also
      known as Anger Control Training, in adolescents with high-functioning ASD. CBT teaches
      children to recognize antecedents and consequences of problem behavior and to use emotion
      regulation and problem-solving skills to reduce irritability, aggression and noncompliance.
      This form of CBT has been well-studied in typically developing children with disruptive
      behavior and we are investigating if this treatment can be feasible and helpful, with
      appropriate modifications, for irritability and disruptive behavior in ASD.
