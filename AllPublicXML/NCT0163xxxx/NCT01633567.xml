  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the approximately 4.6 million LGBT persons in the U.S., smoking rates among those living
      in urban areas are roughly twice that of heterosexuals. Targeted interventions have shown
      great promise in reducing health risk behaviors across a variety of behaviors and population
      groups by enhancing the relevance of the health information. The primary aim of this study is
      to test the efficacy of a culturally targeted group-based smoking cessation intervention (vs.
      a non-targeted intervention) on smoking outcomes among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
      transgender (LGBT) smokers. The investigators anticipate that the culturally targeted
      intervention will be more effective at helping LGBT smokers to successfully stop smoking than
      will the non-targeted intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1 of this study we used focus groups to establish the cultural appropriateness and
      acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention for the LGBT population. For Phase
      2 of this study, we seek to enroll 400 participants in a randomized controlled trial of the
      targeted intervention vs. a non-targeted, comparison condition. Both conditions will consist
      of group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement therapy and peer support. We
      expect that quit rates, stage of readiness, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and treatment
      adherence will be higher among those who received the targeted intervention than those in the
      non-targeted intervention. Furthermore, we expect that a stronger LGBT cultural
      identification and salience of that identity will be associated with more satisfaction and
      adherence to the targeted intervention.

    <description>The culturally targeted program will include the same cognitive and behavioral approaches and smoking education content that is used in the standard program. As such, we will maintain the integrity of the core program. However, cultural targeting of that program has been informed by local LGBT focus group input and testing, the available literature on LGBT smoking rates and behaviors, feedback from a panel of LGBT health experts, and data collected as part of a previous study.</description>

    <description>The culturally targeted version of the behavioral counseling intervention will consist of six group-based smoking cessation counseling sessions.
