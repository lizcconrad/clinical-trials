    <textblock>
      This will be a systematic investigation of the role of walnuts in preventing or slowing age
      related cognitive decline and age related macular degeneration. 700 subjects will be
      recruited between 2 sites, Loma Linda University in California, USA and Hospital Clinic in
      Barcelona, Spain. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the walnut group or the
      control group for a 2 year intervention. Baseline and annual data will be collected and
      analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies suggest that nutrients such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      antioxidants and B-vitamins may protect against age related cognitive decline. Small human
      studies have shown beneficial effects of polyphenol rich foods on cognition and age related
      macular degeneration. Walnuts are a rich source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      alpha-linolenic acid, antioxidants, polyphenols and other bioactive compounds. A 2-year
      intervention will be conducted with healthy, elderly subjects to investigate the role of
      walnuts in preventing or slowing age related cognitive decline and age related macular
      degeneration.

      350 subjects, age 63 to 79 years, will be recruited at each of 2 sites, Loma Linda University
      in California and Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of two groups: walnut group (habitual diet with 1 or 1.5 oz/d walnut supplement) or control
      group (habitual diet only). At baseline and yearly, cardiometabolic risk factors, red blood
      cell membrane fatty acids, urinary polyphenols and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidation
      will be measured. Eye exam, blood pressure and cognitive function tests will be measured at
      the beginning and end of 2 years. At the Barcelona site only, participants will be given a
      brain MRI and carotid ultrasound.

      Descriptive results will be reported as mean plus/minus standard deviation. Primary analysis
      will be carried out on the basis of groups as randomly assigned. Results will be presented as
      appropriate effect sizes with a measure of precision (95% CI). Analysis of covariates gender,
      age, educational status will be conducted.

    <description>Baseline data will be collected using the following neuropsychological evaluations: NART, WAIS III tests of intelligence; ROCF, RAVLT for memory; BNT and semantic category evocation for language; VOSP for perception; copy ROCF for praxis; TMT A, TMT B, FAS word fluency, Stroop test, SDMT, CPT II, CANTAB for frontal cognition. From baseline we hypothesize there will be a 5% difference in cognitive decline between the walnut intervention group and the control group when tests are performed again after the 2 year intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>% change in macular degeneration from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that 30 to 45g per day of walnuts will delay the onset and progression of macular degeneration in healthy elderly subjects. This will be determined by a difference of 5% in the thickness of the retina as measured by OCT.</description>
