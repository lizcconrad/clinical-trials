      This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 6 sites) study which aims to To establish the
      effectiveness of the PillCam Platform with the PillCam Crohn's capsule as demonstrated by
      visualizing the small bowel and colon in patients with active symptoms associated with
      Crohn's disease (CD).

      This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 6 sites) study which aims to evaluate the
      diagnostic yield and safety of the PillCam Platform with the CD capsule in subjects with
      symptoms associated with Crohn's disease. All subjects to be enrolled in this study will have
      evidence of active symptoms associated with Crohn's disease. Each subject will be required to
      follow a bowel preparation regimen and will undergo the Crohn's Disease capsule endoscopy
      procedure and thereafter the ileocolonoscopy procedure on the same day. The ileocolonoscopy
      procedure may be done the following day per physician discretion. If the ileocolonoscopy
      procedure is done within 24 hours from the CE procedure, the subject will stay on clear
      liquid diet. Observations/ assessments to be conducted in the trial detailed in the sections
      below:

    <time_frame>All the end points and outcomes measures will be evaluated within 4 months from end of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>the primary outcome will be evalluated as follow: The number of subjects having active Crohn's disease in their terminal ileum and / or colon as detected by the PillCam Platform with the CD capsule and ileocolonoscopy.
The analysis related to the primary endpoint was applied for the terminal ileum and colon only due to the limited access of ileocolonoscopy.
Each patient was classified as follows:
Active Crohn's disease is likely
Active Crohn's disease is NOT likely &quot;Active Crohn's disease&quot; included the followings lesions:
Aphthous ulceration
Ulcers (other than Aphthous)
Bleeding
Inflammatory stricture Lesions other than the above list were classified as &quot;Non active Crohn's disease.&quot;</description>

        <title>Per-subject Diagnostic Yield of the PillCam Platform With the CD Capsule Within the Terminal Ileum and Colon as Compared to the Ileocolonoscopy Diagnostic Yield Within the Terminal Ileum and Colon</title>
        <description>the primary outcome will be evalluated as follow: The number of subjects having active Crohn's disease in their terminal ileum and / or colon as detected by the PillCam Platform with the CD capsule and ileocolonoscopy.
The analysis related to the primary endpoint was applied for the terminal ileum and colon only due to the limited access of ileocolonoscopy.
Each patient was classified as follows:
Active Crohn's disease is likely
Active Crohn's disease is NOT likely
“Active Crohn’s disease” included the followings lesions:
Aphthous ulceration
Ulcers (other than Aphthous)
Bleeding
Inflammatory stricture Lesions other than the above list were classified as “Non active Crohn’s disease.”</description>
