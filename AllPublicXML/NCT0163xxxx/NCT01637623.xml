  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if two medicines (allopurinol and losartan) can
      influence heart and blood vessel health compared to placebo in patients with sleep apnea who
      are using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this research project are: 1) Determine if treatment with losartan, an
      angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R) antagonist, or allopurinol, a XO inhibitor, normalize
      chemoreflex control of sympathetic outflow and ventilation and improve local vascular
      regulation and stiffness; and 2) Determine if these interventions reduce the severity of
      sleep disordered breathing and lower diurnal blood pressure.
