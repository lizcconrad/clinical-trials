    <textblock>
      The investigators assume that by analysis of different volatile organic compounds in the
      breath, using nanotechnology, the investigators will be able to identify a unique respiratory
      signature of different diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension.

      Five groups of patients will be included in the study; each group will include 50-75
      patients:

      Group -1 - Healthy volunteer, will use as a control. Group -2 - Patients diagnosed as having
      diastolic heart failure with normal pulmonary artery pressure by echocardiography.

      Group - 3 - Patients diagnosed with diastolic heart failure and out of proportion pulmonary
      hypertension confirm by right heart failure.

      Group - 4 - Patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease. Group- 5 Patients
      diagnosed with asthma Demographic and clinical data will be collected for each patient.
      Exhaled alveolar air will be collected from each test groups. Samples will be collected using
      a breath collection method developed according to the recommendations of the American
      Thoracic Society, which effectively avoids artifacts and systematic errors. Two bags will be
      collected from each person tested: One for gas chromatograph analysis, and another one for
      analysis with the sensor array.

      In order to achieve a artificial nose that has high sensitivity towards the unique breath
      markers of patients with specific disease, we will follow a 5-phase approach. In phase-1 we
      will collect suitable breath samples from each patient and compare the patient data to
      age-adjusted healthy controls. In phase-2 we will analyze the collected breath samples with
      the electronic nose setup. These breath samples are our training set. In phase-3 we will
      carry out auxiliary chemical analysis, using gas-chromatography linked with mass spectrometry
      of the breath samples under different aspects. Phase-4 will aim at the improvement of our
      electronic nose setup and will be conducted in parallel to the first three phases. The main
      steps of this phase will include:

        -  Improvement of the performance of the constituent sensors in terms of sensitivity and
           selectivity to the specific diseases biomarkers. The main parameter for sensor
           improvement will be the choice of the organic functionalities of the nanomaterials
           composes the sensors.

        -  Optimization of the choice of sensors in the array. For choosing the sensors we do not
           have to physically replace them, but can carry out the statistical analysis of the
           output of particular sub-groups of sensors in the array, instead of the output of all
           sensors. Based on the results of the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer chemical
           analysis, we will improve and optimize our sensor array so as to achieve: (i) maximum
           sensitivity to the breath biomarkers of the studied diseases and their stage dependent
           concentration profiles; (ii) minimum sensitivity to non-disease related changes of the
           chemical composition of the breath and (iii) minimum sensitivity to the major
           ingredients of the breath, such as water vapor. Technically, we aim at good
           reproducibility of the sensor fabrication. We will attempt to improve separation between
           the test groups by more sophisticated statistical treatment of the collected data.
           Towards the end of this proof-of-concept study we will compare the performance of our
           sensor array to the diagnosis according to clinical symptoms. The comparison will be
           done in terms of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative,
           sensitivity and specificity.
