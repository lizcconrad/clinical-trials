    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is learn if adding cabozantinib (also known as
      XL184) to hormonal therapy can help to control prostate cancer. The safety of this drug will
      also be studied.

      Cabozantinib is designed to block certain proteins in your blood that cause cancer cells to
      grow. This may cause cancer cells to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 1 capsule of
      cabozantinib by mouth 1 time every day while you are on study. You should not eat or drink
      anything other than water for 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking the study drug. You
      should take the capsule with at least 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You will also be given
      separate directions about how to take the study drug.

      You will also receive hormone therapy. The hormone drug you receive will be standard of care
      hormone therapy. The study doctor will decide what hormone therapy you will receive and will
      explain when and how you should take the hormone therapy, as well as its risks.

      You will be given a drug diary where you will record when you take cabozantinib. You should
      return this diary to the study staff when you come into the clinic.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any other drugs
      you may be taking.

      If you are receiving Coumadin, every week for the first 3 weeks, you will have blood drawn
      (about 1 teaspoon) to test your blood clotting function.

      Every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, and then every 6 weeks after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, and then every 12 weeks after that, blood
      (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid and pancreatic function. The frequency
      of the testing may change if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Every 6 weeks, you will have the following tests performed:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure your PSA levels and for biomarker
           testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You may have these test performed near your home if the study doctor thinks you are
           tolerating the treatment.

      Every 12 weeks, you will have a bone scan and CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to
      check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue receiving the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in
      your best interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you have
      intolerable side effects, or if your study doctor thinks it is in your best interest to stop.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      You will be contacted every 6 months after you stop taking the study drug to check on how you
      are feeling and the status of the disease. This will consist of a phone call, e-mail, or
      medical record review. If you are called, each call should last about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Cabozantinib is FDA approved to treat patients with certain
      types of thyroid cancer. Its use in this study is investigational.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             initiation of hormonal therapy.

         11. Sexually active fertile subjects, and their partners, must agree to use medically
             accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female
             condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and for 4
             months after the last dose of study drug(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Biological agents (antibodies, immune modulators, cytokines, or vaccines) or
             radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.

          2. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.

          3. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis or epidural disease requiring current
             treatment including steroids and anti-convulsant.

          4. The subject has had another diagnosis of malignancy requiring systemic treatment
             within the last two years, unless non-melanoma skin cancer, or superficial bladder
             cancer.

          5. The subject has uncontrolled or significant intercurrent illness including, but not
             limited to, the following conditions: Chronically uncontrolled hypertension, defined
             conventionally as consistent and repeated systolic pressures above 140 mmHg or
             diastolic pressures above 90 mmHg despite anti-hypertensive therapy. This may be
             better established with home BP readings than with clinic visit results. There is no
             criterion related to a specific BP result required for eligibility, nor are acute BP
             elevations that are related to iatrogenic causes, acute pain, or other transient
             reversible causes considered to be an exclusion criteria. The intent is to exclude
             patients with chronically uncontrolled hypertension that might be further exacerbated
             by Cabozantinib.

          6. Continued from # 5) Other cardiovascular disorders such as symptomatic congestive
             heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, clinically-significant cardiac

             the study treatment formulation.

         10. Oral corticosteroids &gt;/= 7.5mg/day prednisone (or prednisone equivalents).
