  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy males were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand
      11C-AZ10419369, before and after administration of a single dose escitalopram. A change in
      the binding potential of 11C-AZ10419369 between the baseline and the post-dose condition was
      hypothesized to reflect a change in serotonin concentration.
