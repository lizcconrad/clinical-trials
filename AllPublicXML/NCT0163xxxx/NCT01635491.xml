      The purpose of this study is to describe gastrointestinal motility and transit times in
      healthy subjects by using Motilis 3D-Transit and to compare the total gastrointestinal
      transit time (GITT) to GITT obtained using radioopaque markers.

      The investigators end points are to measure the transit times through different segments of
      the gastrointestinal canal,e.g. gastric emptying, small intestine, total GITT.

      The study is descriptive and is designed to test and evaluate the usefulness of the Motilis
      3D-Transit system. The investigators hypothesize, that with the system transit times through
      different segments of the gastrointestinal canal can be measured.

      The design is made for evaluating the transit times, the inter-subject reproducibility and
      comparison with gold standard for colonic transit time measurement.

      The investigators have chosen to include 20 healthy volunteers.The study is descriptive and
      therefore power calculation is not needed.
