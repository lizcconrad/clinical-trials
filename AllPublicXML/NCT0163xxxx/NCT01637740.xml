    <textblock>
      A retrospective study of 5753 eyes of cataract surgery patients was conducted at our Clinic.
      Ocular optical components measured by optical low coherence reflectometry biometer LENSTAR LS
      900® of the cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome were put in comparison with
      those of cataract myopic eyes group without pseudoexfoliation syndrome.

      A retrospective study of 5753 eyes of cataract surgery patients was conducted at
      investigators Clinic in a period of 2.5 years. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome was found in 255
      eyes. There were only 26 cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Refractive eye
      state was defined by preoperatively calculated emmetropization intraocular lens (IOL) value
      done by optical low coherence reflectometry biometer LENSTAR LS 900®. Ocular optical
      components of the cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome measured by this
      biometer were put in comparison with matched cataract myopic eyes group without
      pseudoexfoliation syndrome that have emmetropization IOL value within the same range as the
      cataract myopic eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome.
