    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare the physical and quality of life benefits of two
      different types of exercise- tai chi versus strength training- for female cancer survivors
      who have had chemotherapy. Each exercise- tai chi and strength training- will be compared to
      participants in a group that performs flexibility and relaxation exercises, which is expected
      to have different benefits than either tai chi or strength training.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and strength training to prevent falls in female
      cancer survivors.

      II. Determine the mechanism by which tai chi and strength training each reduces the risk of
      falls.

      III. Determine how well the benefits of each intervention persist after structured training
      stops.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify and compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and resistance exercise on
      biomarkers common to both cancer progression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women cancer
      survivors. (Optional ancillary study) II. Quantify and compare the relative efficacy of tai
      chi and resistance exercise on biomarkers unique to CVD in women cancer survivors. (Optional
      ancillary study) III. Determine the influence of initial and changes in adiposity on changes
      in biomarkers from exercise. (Optional ancillary study) IV. Explore the effects of exercise
      training on a biomarker of accelerated aging in women cancer survivors. (Optional ancillary
      study)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients attend strength training classes for 1 hour 2 days per week.

      ARM II: Patients attend tai chi classes for 1 hour 2 days per week.

      ARM III: Patients attend supervised stretching and relaxation classes for 1 hour 2 days per
      week.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

    <description>Evaluated with a negative binomial regression model using an intent-to-treat approach. The regression will be performed piecewise, with the change point occurring at 6 months. In addition, we will examine whether participation in an exercise program following the end of the intervention moderates the effect of the intervention on stability, strength, and falls.</description>

    <measure>Muscle strength and postural stability as mediators between interventions and falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Analyzed using structural equation modeling. Manifest model tested with dummy vectors representing tai chi and strength training as exogenous variables, baseline scores of strength (1-RM) and stability (composite SOT score) as exogenous control variables, strength and stability (difference from baseline-6 months) as endogenous variables, and # of falls from baseline to end of intervention as endogenous variable. Analysis also performed replacing composite SOT score with SOM and VEST scores, and 1-RM and composite SOT with strength measures (PPB chair stand) and dynamic stability (gait speed).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total number of falls per participant in strength training and tai chi arms compared to control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Compared between groups while controlling for covariates using negative binomial regression models of total number of falls per participant during the intervention period. A negative binomial regression was chosen over a Poisson regression for modeling the count data because of the over dispersion that is common with actual research data. Intervention type will be entered into the model as 2 dummy vectors, with the reference group being the control group. Fall rates for participants who drop out of the study will be adjusted by accounting for their exposure time within the study timeframe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of interventions in breast cancer survivors (BCS) compared with women with other cancers</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Using the negative binomial regression models, we will include the binary BCS variable and the product of binary BCS and the treatment dummy vectors as independent variables. A significant coefficient for the product term would indicate that having breast cancer versus other types modifies the effect of the intervention on the fall rate. All significant interactions will be plotted to determine the nature of the interactions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in injurious falls, defined as any fall that resulted in fractures, head injuries, sprains, bruises, scrapes, or serious joint injuries, or in a participant seeking outside medical attention, in patients with at least 1 previous fall</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis will be conducted among the subsample that had at least 1 fall using logistic regression. The control variables and dummy vectors for treatment will be the independent variables and the occurrence of at least 1 injurious fall will be the binary dependent variable.</description>

    <measure>Effect of tai chi and resistance exercise on biomarkers common to both cancer progression and CVD</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be tested with a linear mixed effects modeling approach. Specific hypotheses about treatment group effects will be examined through a series of planned contrasts. In addition to evaluating hypotheses based on traditional significance levels, the practical significance of the interventions will be evaluated, and any interaction effects will be interpreted, by summarizing results with respect to effect size.</description>

    <description>Will be tested with a linear mixed effects modeling approach with interaction terms added. Significant interaction terms will indicate that the effect of the exercise intervention depends, or is moderated by, the level of participant body fat at baseline. In addition to evaluating hypotheses based on traditional significance levels, the practical significance of the interventions will be evaluated, and any interaction effects will be interpreted, by summarizing results with respect to effect size.</description>
