  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of RX-10045 ophthalmic
      solution in alleviating the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergies are relatively common among the general population. Ocular signs and symptoms
      include itching, discomfort, redness, chemosis, tearing, and eyelid swelling. Allergic
      reactions can vary from a mild, self-limiting disease, to a debilitating condition that
      significantly impairs the quality of life of allergen-sensitive individuals.

      Currently approved treatments for ocular allergy reduce the signs and symptoms of the early
      phase reaction; however, evidence suggests that many patients suffer from the persistent late
      phase reaction. Manifestations of the late phase reaction occur 6 to 24 hours after allergen
      exposure and are characterized by an influx of acute inflammatory cells into the
      conjunctivae. Administration of anti-inflammatory agents decreases allergy signs and symptoms
      in both the early and late phase reactions.

      RX-10045 has been shown to be efficacious in multiple pre-clinical dry eye disease models and
      in a pre-clinical model of allergic conjunctivitis. The objective of this clinical study is
      to assess the safety and efficacy of RX-10045 ophthalmic solution for the treatment of the
      signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis induced in the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge
      Model of allergic conjunctivitis at 15 minutes and 8 hours after medication instillation. It
      is anticipated that RX-10045 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic
      conjunctivitis and an acceptable risk-benefit profile.
