  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with castrate resistant prostate cancer who are switched from a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists from a LHRH agonist will experience a fall in
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the proportion of patients with castrate resistant Prostate Cancer who have a
      PSA decline of ≥50% from baseline PSA when switched from an LHRH agonist to an LHRH
      antagonist.
