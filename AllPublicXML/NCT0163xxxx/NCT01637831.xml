  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent literature shows an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). On the other hand there are no published
      studies related to CPAP treatment in this patient group. The investigators aim was to assess
      the effect of CPAP on sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA and
      to recognize and overcome possible difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently published studies report a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in
      patients with IPF. Underlying, and usually under-diagnosed OSA in these patients may be a
      reason for impaired sleep quality and may consequently have a negative influence on their
      daily activities and overall quality of life. In addition, underlying OSA may have a negative
      influence on the already impaired IPF-related morbidity and mortality. The absence of any
      effective treatment for IPF so far indicates that the recognition and treatment of generally
      under-diagnosed OSA in IPF patients should be a primary goal. Therefore, our primary aim in
      this study was to assess the results of effective CPAP therapy in terms of sleep quality and
      overall quality of life in IPF patients with moderate to severe OSA. The investigators used
      generally accepted instruments to assess quality of sleep and overall life. In addition, the
      investigators tried to determine and overcome the reasons for poor CPAP compliance in these
      patients

    <description>Participants with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).This arm will complete pre-treatment questionnaires assessing sleep and quality of life, undergo six months of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) to treat OSA, and complete post-treatment the same questionnaires 1, 3 and 6 months later.</description>

    <description>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) management. Subjects with OSA will be trained in the use of CPAP and will be instructed to use CPAP every night for 6 months. These subjects will then return for a post-treatment completion of questionnaires assessing sleep and quality of life 1, 3 and 6 months after the start of effective CPAP treatment.</description>
