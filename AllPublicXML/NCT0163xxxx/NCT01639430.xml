  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective analysis of a quality measurement project examining the quality of vital
      parameter measurement in consecutive patients &gt;= 75 years presenting to the emergency
      department.

      Primary goal of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of body temperature
      measurement using different methods to diagnose infection in patients &gt;= 75 years presenting
      to the emergency department. The secondary goal is to compare the reliability of tympanal and
      temporal artery thermometry with rectal temperature measurement.

    <description>Temperature measurement was done once in all patients included within the first hour of patients´presentation to the emergency department.
Tympanal measurement was carried out by the use of infrared ear thermometry, temporal artery thermometry was done using infrared technology as well.</description>
