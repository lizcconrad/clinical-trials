      This study investigates the feasibility and immunogenicity of the triple combination of
      gemcitabine, Peg-Intron and p53 SLP vaccination in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent ovarian cancer has a dismal prognosis and there is a pressing need to identify more
      efficient therapies. Ovarian cancer is highly immunogenic and good survival is tightly linked
      to the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells and the absence of immunosuppressive immune
      cells. This anti-tumor immune response might be primed by chemotherapy.

      Gemcitabine has immune-modulatory properties in addition to its direct cytotoxic effect in
      platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Additionally, Peg-Intron allows the full maturation of
      dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor response. Moreover, the tumor-associated
      self-antigen p53 is commonly over-expressed in ovarian cancer and can serve as a target for
      immunotherapy. Therefore, chemo-immunotherapy with gemcitabine and Peg-Intron plus/minus p53
      SLP vaccination seems an attractive treatment for recurrent, p53+ ovarian cancer patients.

    <description>8.2.3 The p53 SLP vaccine consists of 9 synthetic 25-30 amino acids long overlapping peptides, spanning amino acids 70-235 of the wt-p53 protein (patent number WO2008147186). Peptides are prepared at the GMP facility of the Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology of the LUMC. At the day of immunization peptides (0.3 mg/peptide) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration 20%) admixed with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH7.5) and emulsified with an equal volume of Montanide ISA-51.The vaccine (2.7mL) is administered subcutaneously.</description>
