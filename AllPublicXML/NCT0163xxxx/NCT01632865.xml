      To evaluate whether recanalization and stenting for symptomatic subacute and chronic
      veterbrobasilar artery occlusion is technically feasible, can prevent from recurrent ischemic
      events and promotes functional recovery of disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke accounts for 87% of cerebrovascular accidents. Of these, a part is the result
      of intracranial veterbrobasilar occlusion. Acute veterbrobasilar artery occlusion is a
      devastating disease with high mortality without successful treatment. A subset of patients
      can survive the acute phase and develop subacute or chronic veterbrobasilar artery occlusion.
      Due to the adequacy of collaterals, some patients can live without any or just very mild
      symptoms. On the contrast, lack of enough collaterals, another patients still presented with
      recurrent ischemic events and progressive disability despite intensive medical therapy.
      Prognosis is extremely poor. It is in this cohort that subacute or chronic revascularization
      is often considered. The optimal treatment in this cohort with non-acute veterbrobasilar
      artery occlusion is unknown, and there is little literature to guide therapy.
      Extracranial-intracranial bypass may revascularize the intracranial artery occlusion.
      However, bypass procedures are technically challenging and are associated with significant
      risk of morbidity and mortality. Recurrent ischemic symptoms despite best medical treatment
      be indication for endovascular revascularization and stent remodeling. This study was to
      evaluate the technical feasibility, safety and treatment effects of recanalization and
      stenting for veterbrobasilar subacute-chronic intracranial artery occlusion。

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) due to the intracranial veterbrobasilar
             artery occlusion.

          2. Occlusions may be diagnosed by TCD (transcranial cerebral doppler), MRA (magnetic
             resonance angiography), or CTA (computed tomographic angiography) to qualify for
             angiogram performed as part of the study protocol but must be confirmed by catheter
             angiography for enrollment in the trial

          3. Time from imaging-documented occlusion and/or from aggravation of clinical symptoms
             (aggravation was defined as change in mRS [modified rankin scale]≥1 and/or NIHSS
             [national institutes of health stroke scale]≥4) to recanalization was greater than 24
             hours. The reasons for delayed intervention were due to delayed diagnosis,
             interhospital transfer, or unsuccessful initial trial of anticoagulation and
             antiplatelet therapy.

          8. Any hemorrhagic infarct within 15 - 30 days that is associated with mass effect

          9. Any history of a primary intracerebral (parenchymal) hemorrhage (ICH)

         10. Any other intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid, subdural, epidural) within 30 days

         11. Any untreated chronic subdural hematoma of greater than 5 mm in thickness

         12. Presence of any of the following unequivocal cardiac sources of embolism: chronic or
             paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, mechanical valve, endocarditis,
             intracardiac clot or vegetation, myocardial infarction within three months, dilated
             cardiomyopathy, left atrial spontaneous echo contrast, ejection fraction less than 30%

             diathesis, platelets &lt; 100,000, hematocrit &lt; 30, INR [international normalized ratio]
             &gt; 1.5, clotting factor abnormality that increases the risk of bleeding, current
             alcohol or substance abuse, uncontrolled severe hypertension (systolic pressure &gt; 180
             mm Hg or diastolic pressure &gt; 115 mm Hg), severe liver impairment (AST [aspartate
             transaminate]or ALT [alanine transaminase]&gt; 3 x normal, cirrhosis), creatinine &gt; 3.0
             (unless on dialysis)

         16. Major surgery (including open femoral, aortic, or carotid surgery) within previous 30
             days or planned in the next 90 days after enrollment

         17. Pregnancy or of childbearing potential and unwilling to use contraception for the
             duration of this study

         18. Life expectancy＜1 year due to other medical conditions.

         20. Other special conditions considered by neurological physician, neurosurgeon and
             neuro-intervention doctors, weren't suitable for recanalization procedure.
