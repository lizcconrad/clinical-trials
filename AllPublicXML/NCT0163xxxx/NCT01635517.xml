  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the present study are to investigate prospectively the clinical course and
      outcome of the hospitalized heart failure patients treated with tolvaptan for management of
      fluid retention and serum sodium levels of less than 140 mEq/L and also to analyze the
      factors related with the efficacy including outcome of tolvaptan therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vasopressin mediates fluid retention in heart failure. Tolvaptan, an oral, nonpeptide,
      selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, shows promise for management of heart failure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy 1) Alleviation of the signs of body fluid retention 2) Change of body weight 3) Changes in the daily urinary volume</measure>
    <time_frame>At the day of discontinuation of tolvaptan or day 7, whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>1) Alleviation of the signs of body fluid retention by the 7th day of treatment with tolvaptan (or the day of discontinuation of the drug in cases where tolvaptan treatment has been discontinued before the 7th day) as compared with the observations made on the day before the start of treatment 2) Change of body weight by the 7th day of treatment with tolvaptan as compared with the level measured on the day before the start of treatment 3) Changes in the daily urinary volume by the 7th day of treatment with tolvaptan as compared with the values measured on the day before the start of treatment</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Long-term outcome (1 year after tolvaptan administration) 1) Time from enrollment to cardiovascular events 2) Time from enrollment to re-hospitalization for aggravation of heart failure 3) Time from enrollment to all-cause death</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after administration of tolvaptan</time_frame>
    <description>1) Time from enrollment to cardiovascular events within 1 year after administration of tolvaptan 2) Time from enrollment to re-hospitalization for aggravation of heart failure within 1 year after administration of tolvaptan 3) Time from enrollment to all-cause death within 1 year after administration of tolvaptan
Cardiovascular events included death from heart failure, death from acute coronary syndrome, death from stroke, sudden death, death of unknown causes, death from other cardiovascular causes, readmission for heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Search for the factors related with the efficacy of tolvaptan therapy and long-term outcome 1) related factors regarding efficacy of tolvaptan 2 ) related factors regarding long-term outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after administration of tolvaptan</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory analysis will be performed to determine which factors relate with the efficacy of tolvaptan therapy or long-term outcome. Factors will include age, gender, medical past history, medication, NYHA classification, Nohria/Steavenson classification, laboratory data (Na, K, Cl, Albumin, Cr, BUN, AST, ALT, gamma-GTP, LDH, T-Bil, BNP, NT-pro BNP, copeptin, galectin-3,aldosteron,angiotensin II, renin, noradrenaline), heart rate, blood pressure, echocardiography data, intake/urine volume and osmolality.</description>
