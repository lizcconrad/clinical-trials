      The purpose of this study is to better understand why some women with breast cancer develop
      chronic pain.

    <textblock>
      Women with breast cancer who either have chronic pain or who do not have chronic pain will be
      asked to enroll. Those who participate will have pictures taken of their brain using MRI when
      they are lying still and also when pressure is being applied to their thumbnails. These
      pictures will be compared to patients without breast cancer who do not have pain and to those
      who have other types of pain, such as fibromyalgia. By taking and analyzing these pictures
      the investigators hope to understand more about why breast cancer survivors develop pain
      after their diagnosis and treatment. In the future the investigators hope to better treat the
      pain or possibly even prevent the pain from occurring in the first place.

    <description>The primary objective of this pilot trial is to determine if there may be differences in mechanical pain sensitivity and functional MRI brain activation patterns in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain as compared to breast cancer patients without chronic pain, to patients with fibromyalgia, or to healthy controls.</description>
