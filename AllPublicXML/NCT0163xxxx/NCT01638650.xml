    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of a
      modified Invirase (saquinavir)/ritonavir regimen in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients.
      Patients will receive Invirase 500 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily orally for the first
      week, followed by Invirase 1000 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily orally for the second
      week. The study treatment will be given in combination with two Nucleoside Reverse
      Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), in accordance with the current clinical HIV treatment
      guidelines. Anticipated time on study treatment is 14 days.
