  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of
      single doses of odanacatib in mature adolescents and young adults who are currently receiving
      glucocorticoid therapy. The primary hypotheses for the study are that a single dose of
      odanacatib is well tolerated in mature adolescents and following single dose administration
      of odanacatib 50 mg, there is no clinically important difference in AUC0-inf between mature
      adolescents and young adults.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Urinary Aminoterminal Crosslinked Telopeptide of Type 1 Collagen (uNTx/Cr) at 168 Hours Postdose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (predose Day 1) and 168 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary aminoterminal crosslinked telopeptide of Type I collagen (uNTx/Cr) is a biochemical marker of bone resorption. Odanacatib selectively and potently inhibits cathepsin K (CatK), the primary catalyst of bone resorption. Since CatK is the enzyme responsible for bone matrix degradation it is possible to use bone resorption biomarkers to quantify pharmacodynamic effects in short term clinical studies. CatK cleaves the N-telopeptide of collagen type I to form NTx and also cleaves the serum C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (1-CTP - itself generated by the action of matrix metalloproteases) to generate CTx. Urine NTx measurements (in bone collagen equivalents [BCE]) have been normalized to creatinine clearance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinary Aminoterminal Crosslinked Telopeptide of Type 1 Collagen (uNTx/Cr) at 168 Hours Postdose</title>
        <description>Urinary aminoterminal crosslinked telopeptide of Type I collagen (uNTx/Cr) is a biochemical marker of bone resorption. Odanacatib selectively and potently inhibits cathepsin K (CatK), the primary catalyst of bone resorption. Since CatK is the enzyme responsible for bone matrix degradation it is possible to use bone resorption biomarkers to quantify pharmacodynamic effects in short term clinical studies. CatK cleaves the N-telopeptide of collagen type I to form NTx and also cleaves the serum C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (1-CTP – itself generated by the action of matrix metalloproteases) to generate CTx. Urine NTx measurements (in bone collagen equivalents [BCE]) have been normalized to creatinine clearance.</description>
