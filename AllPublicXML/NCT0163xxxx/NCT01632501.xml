  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The freedom of choice in medicine is based on the physician's ability to treat their patients
      with the best available therapy. The armamentarium for percutaneous intervention is
      frequently determined on the basis of subjective criteria and the experience of the
      interventional cardiologist. The evaluation of devices used in coronary intervention,
      especially angiography and its clinical outcomes, has rarely been investigated; the
      exceptions are studies on stents. Therefore, the freedom of choice for the interventional
      cardiologist has been challenged, especially because of cost restrictions. This way this
      study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a device of a single brand in performing
      percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (guide catheters, guidewires, balloons, and
      stents) in selected patients.
