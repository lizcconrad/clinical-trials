      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses,
      as well as of repeated administrations of GNbAC1 in MS patients.

      Scientific research has shown that the expression of genes of a virus which is integrated in
      the Human genetic material, the Multiple Sclerosis associated RetroVirus (MSRV) could play a
      critical role in the causation of multiple sclerosis.

      GNbAC1 is an experimental medication, which neutralizes (i.e. inactivates) a protein of MSRV
      that might contribute to the development or deterioration of multiple sclerosis.

             partners of childbearing potential have to use adequate contraception during the
             study. Contraception methods should be followed during the study and up to 3 months
             after the last study drug administration. Female subjects who are women of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) will have to be tested negative with a pregnancy test
             (serum or urine) at screening and Day 1 and before each repeated administrations of
             GNbAC1.

          -  Patients with Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) according to the Revised McDonald criteria
             2010 or patients with Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) or patients with
             Relapsing-Remitting MS(RRMS)according to the Revised McDonald criteria 2010 who cannot
             be treated with available treatments for MS due to intolerance, non response or
             refusal of treatment;

          -  Score ≤ 6.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS);
