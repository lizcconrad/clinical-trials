  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the extremely limited availability of donated organs, transplant candidates must be
      carefully evaluated and selected to ensure the success of the transplant and value of the
      organ to the recipient. Medical criteria for pre-transplant evaluation of patients is well
      established, however, listing criteria for psychosocial risk factors (e.g., understanding of
      illness and transplant process, psychiatric history, support system, compliance, etc) is less
      standardized. The purpose of this research is to study the psychometric properties (e.g.,
      predictive validity) of the new pre-transplant &quot;Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment
      for Transplant&quot; (SIPAT) examination in patients who received heart, kidney, liver, or lung
      transplant and underwent the SIPAT evaluation before treatment. This new screening tool was
      designed to standardize the evaluation process of psychosocial risk factors and their
      severity, in order to enhance predictions of medical and psychosocial outcomes of patients
      post-transplant.

      If the SIPAT is used for standard, pre-transplant assessment, risk factors that may be
      amenable to clinical intervention could be identified. In turn, this may assist in developing
      a comprehensive psychosocial treatment plan for each individual, with the ultimate goal of
      minimizing preventable problems, mitigating risk, and optimizing graft survival, patient
      function, and quality of life.
