  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms are highly frequent among cancer patients. These symptoms significantly
      impair quality of life (e.g., hopelessness, greater risk of suicidal behaviours) and may even
      affect patients' prognosis (e.g., through decreased adherence to cancer treatments).
      Cognitive therapy (CT) is an established treatment for depression in the general population,
      but its efficacy has not yet been investigated in non-metastatic cancer patients.
      Furthermore, because the accessibility to CT is very limited in routine cancer care and
      because many patients are reluctant to use pharmacological treatment, they often turn to
      alternative treatments such as bright light therapy (BLT), but empirical data on its efficacy
      are needed before its use can be recommended. Goal 1: To assess at post-treatment, as
      compared to a waiting-list control condition, the effect of bright light therapy (BLT) and
      cognitive therapy (CT): (1a) in reducing depressive symptoms; and (1b) in improving
      subjective and objective sleep parameters, in reducing fatigue and anxiety and in increasing
      patients' functioning and quality of life. Goal 2: To compare at post-treatment and at 3- and
      6-month follow-ups the effect of BLT and CT : (2a) in reducing depressive symptoms; and (2b)
      in improving subjective and objective parameters of sleep, in reducing fatigue and anxiety
      and in increasing patients' functioning and quality of life. It is hypothesized that, As
      compared to control patients after their waiting period, both BLT and CT groups will have
      significantly greater improvement of all symptoms at post-treatment. However, as compared to
      BLT patients, CT patients will show greater improvements of all symptoms at post-treatment
      and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. This study will provide empirical data on the efficacy of
      two approaches for treating depressive symptoms in cancer patients in order to better inform
      the scientific community, health care providers, and patients on the most effective
      depression treatments to implement in cancer care.
