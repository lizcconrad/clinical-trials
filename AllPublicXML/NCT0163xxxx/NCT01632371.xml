    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether scoring balloon (SCB) plus paclitaxel-coated
      balloon (PCB) is superior to PCB alone for the treatment of restenosis within &quot;limus&quot;-eluting
      stents (LES)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment of in-BMS-restenosis seems to be implantation of a DES which is
      supported by a large body of evidence. Nevertheless, several recent published studies have
      shown a substantial reduction in late lumen loss and angiographic restenosis using
      paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) for restenotic lesions. Given the increased world-wide use
      of DES and the use of DES in increasingly complex coronary disease patterns, the number of
      patients presenting with restenosis after DES implantation will further increase in the
      coming decade.

      Data regarding the optimal treatment of in-DES-restenosis are very limited: Implanting a new
      DES for in-DES-restenosis has been reported to associate with repeat restenosis rates as high
      as 20%. In addition, an increased risk of stent thrombosis has been associated with complex
      stenting and with additional DES implantation. Thus, for lesions which develop restenosis
      after LES implantation, the optimal treatment strategy remains unknown.

      Few results on small sample-size populations have been reported in patients treated with
      scoring or cutting balloon (SCB) technology for treatment of BMS restenosis as compared to
      plain balloon angioplasty. Moreover, the efficacy of SCB angioplasty in DES restenosis has
      not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, the potential additive benefit of SCB angioplasty
      in patients undergoing PCB therapy remains to be elucidated. The hypothesis behind this
      concept is that the application of SCB prior to deployment of PCB may increase the
      bioavailability of paclitaxel within the restenotic tissue, and therefore may increase the
      efficacy of PCB. There are numerous preclinical studies to support this hypothesis, which
      show that lesion preparation is an important pre-requisite for the effectiveness of PCB.
