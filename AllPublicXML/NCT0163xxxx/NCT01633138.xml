  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether monetary reinforcement for performance
      will enhance the effects of cognitive remediation therapy for substance users seeking
      treatment at an outpatient facility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty individuals seeking treatment for an alcohol or cocaine use disorder at the Substance
      Abuse Treatment Unit (SATU) will be randomized to receive cognitive remediation therapy with
      or without additional compensation based on performance. Participants will use the
      computerized cognitive remediation program (PSSCogRehab 2012) three times per week for four
      weeks. The primary outcome measure will be an improved performance on the computerized tasks,
      with secondary outcomes of changes in cognitive functioning (e.g., attention, concentration,
      memory) as measured by neuropsychological tests between baseline and post-treatment.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Performance scores on various computerized cognitive remediation tasks will be measured repeatedly during the 4 week study. These scores include &quot;time to completion&quot;, &quot;number of errors&quot;, &quot;number of words correctly recalled&quot;, and &quot;percentage of task completed&quot;</description>

    <measure>Improved cognitive function on neuropsychological tests</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognitive function between baseline and post-treatment will be measured by performance on neuropsychological tests, such as Trail Making Test A &amp; B, Wisconsin Card Sort Test, Digit Symbol Test from WAIS-IV, and the Continuous Performance Test-II (CPT-II).</description>
