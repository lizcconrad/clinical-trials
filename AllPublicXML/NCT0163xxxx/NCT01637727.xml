      The primary goal of this proposed research deals with estimating the risk of developing type
      2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in women with a history of GDM compared to women without a
      history of GDM. In addition, this study will attempt to evaluate the effect of parity on the
      late appearance of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in this unique population.

        The proposed research format is: a case control study using a historical cohort of women
        diagnosed with GDM. The study group will include women who gave birth in Shaare Zedek
        Medical Center between the years 2000 and 2010. Women with a GDM history will be identified
        based on the gestational diabetes clinic files. Women without a history of GDM who will be
        the control group will be identified from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center birth
        registration records
