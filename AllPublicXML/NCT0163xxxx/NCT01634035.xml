  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the correlation between Hba1c and the mean plasma glucose in
      diabetic hemodialysis patients.We are reviewing if HbA1c is a good clinical tool to assess
      glycemic control over a 3 months duration in hemodialysis patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hb turnover in hemodialysis population is higher than the general population leading to a
      general believe that HbA1c tend to underestimate mean plasma glucose.

      The investigators are trying to define the correlation between mean plasma glucose and HbA1c
      in the hemodialysis population and trying to study the factors that could affect this
      correlation (dose of erythropoetin, ret count..) We are trying to see if HbA1c is a better
      tool to assess glycemic control over 1 month than glycemic control over 3 month.

      This clinicaly will translate in obtaining HbA1c more frequently in hemodialysis patients to
      assess their glycemic control.
