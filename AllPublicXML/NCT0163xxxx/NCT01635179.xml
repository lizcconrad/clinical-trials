  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prevent bronchial aspiration during induction of anaesthesia it has been a common
      procedure to perform a cricoid pressure, called Sellicks Maneuver, to occlude esophagus, and
      thereby prevent aspiration. During the last ten years the efficiency of this maneuver has
      been discussed, since it probably prolong the intubation time and do not significantly
      reduces the risk of aspiration.

      The hypothesis is that Sellicks Maneuver prolong the time of intubation and reduces the view
      of the laryngeal inlet, during intubation with a videolaryngoscopy.

      The hypothesis is tested by a double-blinded randomized study where patients is intubated
      twice, with and without Sellicks Maneuver, in a randomized order. The specific cricoid
      pressure is blinded to the personal performing the intubation.
