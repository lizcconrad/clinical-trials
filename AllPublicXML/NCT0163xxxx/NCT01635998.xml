  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the H-FIB trial is to determine the role of renal sympathetic denervation in
      the prevention of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) recurrence in patients with hypertension for whom
      a catheter-based AF ablation procedure is planned. Patients will be randomized to either AF
      catheter ablation (usual therapy) or AF catheter ablation plus renal sympathetic denervation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the potential additional benefit of performing renal
      sympathetic denervation at the same time as an AF ablation procedure, in order to improve the
      long-term success of the AF procedure.

      To take part in this study, you must meet all study requirements. Screening visit tests and
      procedures such as a physical exam, blood pressure, review of medical history, blood sample,
      and a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) are done to see if you are eligible to be in the
      study.

      Patients who qualify for the study and provide consent will undergo catheter ablation for AF.
      Very thin electrode catheters, similar to long wires, will be inserted into blood vessels in
      the groin. Using the ablation catheter, we will &quot;ablate&quot; or damage the tissue adjacent to
      your pulmonary veins that is not behaving normally.

      Immediately following the catheter ablation, patients will undergo a renal angiogram in order
      to assess suitability for catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation. A renal angiogram is
      an x-ray study of the blood vessels in the kidney to evaluate for blockage, and abnormalities
      that could be affecting the blood supply to the kidney. It is performed by injecting contrast
      dye through a catheter (a tiny tube) into the blood vessels of the kidney.
