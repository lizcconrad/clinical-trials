  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad,an increased dose of
      Abiraterone Acetate in combination with prednisone has on patients and their prostate cancer.
      This study will investigate whether an increased-dose (2,000mg daily) is safe and potentially
      effective when given to patients whose cancer has grown while taking the standard dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter trial of Abiraterone Acetate in patients with progressive
      prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation with a particular focus on the pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic events occurring at the time of apparent drug
      resistance. All eligible patients will have baseline (prior to taking the first dose of
      Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg/daily) measures of routine clinical variables along with
      measurements of baseline and treatment related changes in testosterone, androgen, and
      endocrine levels, genotyping of SNPs in the selected enzymes known to be directly inhibited
      by Abiraterone Acetate, and collection of circulating tumor cells. All patients will be
      requested to consent for biopsies which will be performed prior to treatment and at the time
      of disease progression on standard dose Abiraterone Acetate therapy. These biopsies will be
      analyzed for expression of an AR-signature as well as for microarray analysis to explore
      changes in methylation, and expression of CYP17A1 and other androgen synthesis genes.

      Subjects will then begin daily oral therapy with Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg po daily with
      physiologic prednisone 5mg BID replacement. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours
      before the dose of Abiraterone Acetate and for at least 1 hour after the dose of Abiraterone
      Acetate is taken. PSA will be followed monthly. Abiraterone Acetate will be supplied by
      Janssen Services. At the end of the first month, the third month, and then every three months
      thereafter, Abiraterone Acetate, testosterone, and androgen levels will be followed. Subjects
      not achieving a greater than or equal to 30% PSA decline at 12 weeks will be taken off study.
      At the time of progression (defined by RECIST criteria OR by the Prostate Cancer Working
      Group 2 (PCWG) criteria as a 25% increase in PSA above the nadir and an increase in the
      absolute value PSA of at least 2ng/dl or back to baseline confirmed at least 2 weeks
      afterward) for subjects who achieved an initial greater than or equal to 30% PSA decline
      (referred to as Progressive Disease (PD) #1), subjects will begin taking Abiraterone Acetate
      1000 mg po BID. Patients will continue to take prednisone 5mg BID and will continue this
      therapy until a second progression at which point they will be withdrawn from the study.
      While 1000 mg po BID is not the FDA recommended dose, it is the dose to be investigated in
      this study.

             of birth control with adequate barrier protection as determined to be acceptable by
             the principal investigator and sponsor during the study and for 1 week after last
             study drug administration.

          -  Have a baseline serum potassium of ≥ 3.5 mEq/L

          -  Have aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin

          -  Have a serum albumin of ≥ 3.0 g/dL

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (In patients with known Gilbert Syndrome, a total
             bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN, with direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN is acceptable)

          -  Have a platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μL

          -  Have an absolute neutrophil count of &gt; 1500 cell/mm3

          -  Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL.

          -  Progressive disease after androgen deprivation: PSA evidence for progressive prostate
             cancer consists of a PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has risen on at least 2
             successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. If the confirmatory PSA value is less
             than the screening PSA value, then an additional test for rising PSA will be required
             to document progression.

          -  Antiandrogen Withdrawal Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of primary
             androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression following discontinuation of
             antiandrogen.

          -  Disease progression after antiandrogen withdrawal is defined as 2 consecutive rising
             PSA values, obtained at least 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue
             progression.

          -  For patients receiving flutamide, at least one of the PSA values must be obtained 4
             weeks or more after flutamide discontinuation.

          -  For patients receiving bicalutamide or nilutamide, at least one of the PSA values must
             be obtained 6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation.

          -  No antiandrogen withdrawal response is expected in patients in whom antiandrogen
             therapy did NOT result in a decline in PSA or in those patients in whom the response
             to antiandrogens was &lt; 3 months. Therefore, it is not necessary to wait for AAWD in
             pts without PSA decline on an anti-androgen or in those in whom a PSA response lasted
             &lt; 3 months.
