          -  The subject reports symptoms consistent with a suspected STI such as abnormal
             discharge, genital itching, pain/discomfort during sexual intercourse or urination,
             and/or lower abdominal discomfort

          -  Subject is asymptomatic and known to be partners with, or a contact of, a person with

             examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A potential subject will be ineligible for clinical trial enrollment if the subject,
             clinician, or medical record reports any of the following:

          -  The subject took antibiotic medications within the last 21 days

          -  Subject already participated in this study

          -  Subject has a history of illness that the principal investigator (PI) or designee

             the clinical trial

          -  Subject has a history of illness that the PI or designee considers could create an
