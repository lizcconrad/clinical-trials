  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the miRNA expression in subjects with nasal polyps and
      Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) differs from the miRNA expressed in subjects
      with nasal polyps but without Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).

  <detailed_description>

      Nasal epithelial tissue will be collected from the inferior nasal turbinates of ten subjects
      with nasal polyps and AERD disease and from the inferior turbinates of ten subjects with
      nasal polyps but without AERD. A rhinoprobe™ will be used to collect this epithelial tissue.
      These samples will be analyzed by miRNA assay to determine if there is a difference in
      mircroRNA expression between the two subject groups.

        This study will be a prospective study design with a target sample size of 20. The
        objective of conducting it as a prospective study is to confirm that the sampling
        procedures and analysis methodology work as expected before attempting a larger study. We
        propose to have 10 study participants with nasal polyps but without AERD and 10 study
        participants with nasal polyps and AERD. If the results of this study are promising, larger
        studies with sufficient power for statistical analysis will be considered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages eligible for study: 18 to 70 years

          -  Genders eligible for study: male and female

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is obtained prior to study

          -  Subjects have a physician diagnosis of nasal polyps without AERD or physician
             diagnosis of nasal polyps with AERD. The diagnosis of aspirin sensitive asthma must be
             present for a minimum of three months. If the medical history is indeterminate either
             an aspirin challenge will be required to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. An aspirin
             challenge is a protocol that can safely be performed as an out patient procedure with
             close supervision.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and/or lactating females.

          -  Current tobacco use.

          -  Severe psychiatric illness.

          -  Current illicit substance use or dependence and/or abuse of alcohol.

          -  Primary or secondary immunodeficiency.

          -  Any clinically significant uncontrolled medical condition that would put the patient
             at risk.
