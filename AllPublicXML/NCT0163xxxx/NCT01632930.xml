    <textblock>
      The ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate is the validated technique for the diagnosis
      of prostate cancer, the first human cancer and second leading cause of cancer death. Overall,
      in more than half of cases, prostate biopsies performed in search of a prostate cancer are
      negative. In this population, there is no consensus recommendation on how to care, leading to
      repeated invasive biopsies, potential sources of complications.

      The PCA3 urine test (ProgensaTM, GenProbe) is an innovative diagnostic tool to predict the
      positivity of prostate biopsies, especially in patients who had at least one negative biopsy.
      Proposed in clinical practice in France as a commercial kit, it is expensive and is not
      covered by health insurance. It is therefore essential to assess the medical and economic
      impact of its introduction into medical practice.

      The investigators propose to set up a study of high standard of proof, multicenter, based on
      recruitment of patients treated in hospitals. This working hypothesis is that the
      availability of the PCA3 test results would reduce the number of invasive biopsies performed
      incorrectly in patients already had at least one negative biopsy, thus improving the
      diagnostic strategy of prostate cancer.

    <description>urinary PCA3 test will be performed in patients before they undergo prostate biopsy for increased serum PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. Patients with negative biopsies will be definitively enrolled in the study. The physician in charge will have knowledge of PCA3 test results and will be asked to determine the subsequent follow-up taking these results into account.</description>
