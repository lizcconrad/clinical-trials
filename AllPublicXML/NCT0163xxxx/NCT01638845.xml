      INTRODUCTION: Hip Fracture is a public health problem because of its constantly increasing
      frequency and its high morbidity and mortality. The leading cause of death is cardiovascular
      decompensation, caused by painful phenomena associated with fracture and orthopedic
      surgery.With hip fracture, epidural local analgesia techniques have proven their benefit in
      mortality but are associated with numerous side effects that prevent routine use. Peripheral
      analgesic techniques locoregional the lumbar plexus, much safer, cause a decrease in
      postoperative pain after surgery for hip fracture and a decrease in mortality at 6 months.
      Elderly patients suffering from a hip fracture, no study has investigated the effect of local
      analgesia continuous femoral perineural catheter on the incidence of cardiovascular events in
      the perioperative period.

      OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this work is to show that perineural analgesia block
      continuous local anesthetic reduces the incidence of cardiovascular complications in the
      preoperative period of a patient with a hip fracture and fact, show that this technique
      decreases the incidence of mortality at one year of patients with a hip fracture (secondary
      objective).

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, descriptive type. It
      compares two populations of patients: one has a perineural analgesia by continuous infusion
      via a catheter of ropivacaine (n = 157) associated with a systemic analgesia and the other
      only systemic analgesia without development of a catheter perineural (n = 157). The duration
      of patient participation will be 12 months. In the first 24 hours after a hip fracture after
      randomization, study participants will benefit from the installation under strict asepsis, a
      continuous block by catheter, placed by an anesthesiologist experienced control room
      post-interventional. The local analgesia will be provided by continuous administration via
      the perineural catheter, ropivacaine for 5 days for the treated group. Except the local
      analgesia protocol, the protocols pre-and postoperative systemic analgesia and general
      anesthesia will be identical for all participants of the 2 groups, similar to techniques
      proposed in the context of everyday clinical practice, ensuring analgesia optimal for all
      patients in the study. The main features will be found three bioassays Troponin IC and 3
      electrocardiograms at the entrance to the hospital, J3 and J5 after inclusion. In addition,
      cardiovascular clinical monitoring and quantification of pain ( will be performed daily for 8
      days after inclusion. Finally, an assessment of higher functions by ladder MMS will be
      conducted at the entrance, J3, J5 and J8. Moreover, a survey of survival at 1 month, 3 months
      and 1 year will be realized.
