      Because the diabetics are fracturing at a younger age than the general population (12), this
      leads us to believe there are significant factors that lead to fracture in Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus (DM) other than bone mineral density (BMD). Very little longitudinal data exists on
      BMD in adults with Type 1 DM and the effects of glucose control on BMD. No longitudinal data
      exists on pQCT in adults with Type 1 DM.

      Hypothesis: Adult subjects with diabetes and poor glucose control will lose bone mineral
      density (BMD) as measured by DXA compared to age and sex matched healthy controls.

        Subjects who have Type 1 DM and their age and sex matched control and have been enrolled in
        a study of Type 1 DM and bone and had a baseline DXA and pQCT during the last 4 years.
        Persons that completed visit 1 for the previous study and had a DXA and pQCT done will be
        invited back for repeat DXA and pQCT measurement. If a diabetic patient does not have an
        age and sex matched control or their control does not want to be in the longitudinal study
        a new age and sex matched control will be recruited.
