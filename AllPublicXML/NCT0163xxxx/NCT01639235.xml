  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on a population of flight attendants who were exposed to occupational
      secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS). This research will examine associations between flight
      attendant SHS exposure and development of respiratory illnesses, reproductive problems, and
      cardiovascular diseases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that exposure to the secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) in
      the confined workspace of commercial aircraft prior to the ban of cigarette smoking is
      responsible for long-term damage on the health of nonsmoking flight attendants. We will
      compare the data collected from our pre-ban flight attendant participants to age-matched,
      nonsmoking controls from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)
      database. The results of our study should permit us to determine if SHS exposure is the cause
      of long-term increased cardiovascular morbidity and risk, as well as increased susceptibility
      to respiratory illnesses.

    <description>Flight attendants fill out the electronic Exposure Questionnaire prior to their appointments. Part of the Questionnaire is a section on reproductive health. The answers to these survey questions in addition to information gathered and saved in APeX during the clinic visit are used for analysis on reproductive health of flight attendants.</description>

    <description>A 45 mL blood specimen is drawn from interested patients to be stored in the research lab as well as analyzed in a UCSF laboratory. Results of the blood analysis performed in the research labs, such as secondhand smoke biomarkers and advanced lipid biomarkers, will not be shared with the subject.</description>

      There is an optional blood draw blood portion to the research study. A sample is collected
      from the interested flight attendant. The majority of the sample is processed and stored in
      the FAMRI biorepository for future research purposes to identify biomarkers of cardiovascular
      risk and secondhand smoke. The remainder of the sample is analyzed for the flight attendant.
      A lipid profile is sent to the flight attendant participant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Never smoker flight attendants who began working for airlines before the smoking ban
             on aircrafts went into effect. Never smoker is defined as those with history of
             tobacco use of less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.

          2. SHS exposure for at least 1 year while working with the airlines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 1 year of occupational exposure to SHS

          2. Smoking more than 100 cigarettes over a lifetime
