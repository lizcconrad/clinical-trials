    <textblock>
      Single center prospective placebo-controlled cross-over phase II study.

        -  To assess if canakinumab can induce clinical improvement and/or complete clinical
           remission of chronic idiopathic urticaria at week 4 as compared to placebo

        -  To compare canakinumab and placebo treated patients in the percentage who achieve
           complete clinical remission at week 1, 2, 4, and 8.

        -  To compare the percentage with clinical improvement as measured by UAS7 score at week 1,
           2, 4, and 8 in canakinumab and placebo treated patients

        -  To compare the percentage of canakinumab and placebo treated patients with 75% and 100%
           improvement of their baseline (Run-in-period) UAS7 score at week 1,2,4,and 8

        -  To compare the daily wheal score for Days 1 to 7 in canakinumab and placebo treated
           patients
