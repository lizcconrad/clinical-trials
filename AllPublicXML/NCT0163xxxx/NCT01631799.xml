  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement is very common in Germany. After surgery patients have severe pain in
      the knee; initiation of the physiotherapy, however, is important in the first three days
      after surgery. Continuous femoral blockade and continuous (lumbar) epidural analgesia are
      commonly used after surgery. Both methods are used in Germany. Both methods have advantages
      and disadvantages. We wanted to answer the question which method of analgesia - after total
      knee replacement - is better concerning complications and function (after 3 months) ?
