      Otherwise healthy subjects who are currently bein maintained on either methadone or
      buprenorphine/naloxone for opioid maintenance therapy who have been on a stable dose for at
      least 30 days will be administered BI 201335 daily to determine if a drug interaction occurs
      between BI 201335 and either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone.

    <measure>Pharmacodynamic Assessment of Withdrawal From Either Methadone or Buprenorphine/Naloxone Using the Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS)-Change From Baseline</measure>

    <description>The OOWS is conducted by a trained independent examiner for either the presence or absence of the following symptoms during a 10 minute observation period at designated times during the trial. The minimum possible OOWS score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 13. Objective criteria: Yawning, Rhinorrhoea, Piloerection, perspiration, lacrimation, mydriasis, hot and cold flushes, restlessness, vomiting, tremors, anxiety, muscle twitches, abdominal cramps. Higher score indicates increasing severity of opiate withdrawal syndrome.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacodynamic Assessment of Withdrawal From Either Methadone or Buprenorphine/Naloxone Using the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS)-Change From Baseline</measure>

    <description>The SOWS is a subjective scale self-evaluated by the subject. The SOWS shows items reflecting the common motor, autonomic, gastrointestinal, musculo-skeletal, and psychic symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Subjects are instructed to rate each symptom on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely) at designated times [c.f. Section 3.1]. The minimum possible SOWS score is 0, the maximum 64. The following subjective criteria are answered by the subject using the scale below: 1) I feel anxious, 2) I feel like yawning 3) I am perspiring, 4) My eyes are watering, 5) My nose is running, 6) I have goose flesh, 7) I am shaking 8) I have hot flushes, 9) I have cold flushes, 10) My bones and muscles ache, 11) I feel restless, 12) I feel nauseous, 13) I feel like vomiting, 14) My muscles twitch, 15) I have cramps in my stomach, 16) I feel like shooting up now. Higher score indicates increasing severity of opiate withdrawal syndrome.</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamic Assessment of Withdrawal From Either Methadone or Buprenorphine/Naloxone Using the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS)-Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>The SOWS is a subjective scale self-evaluated by the subject. The SOWS shows items reflecting the common motor, autonomic, gastrointestinal, musculo-skeletal, and psychic symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Subjects are instructed to rate each symptom on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely) at designated times [c.f. Section 3.1]. The minimum possible SOWS score is 0, the maximum 64. The following subjective criteria are answered by the subject using the scale below: 1) I feel anxious, 2) I feel like yawning 3) I am perspiring, 4) My eyes are watering, 5) My nose is running, 6) I have goose flesh, 7) I am shaking 8) I have hot flushes, 9) I have cold flushes, 10) My bones and muscles ache, 11) I feel restless, 12) I feel nauseous, 13) I feel like vomiting, 14) My muscles twitch, 15) I have cramps in my stomach, 16) I feel like shooting up now. Higher score indicates increasing severity of opiate withdrawal syndrome.</description>
