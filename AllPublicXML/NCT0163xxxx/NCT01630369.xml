      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the decrease of Hb A1c ≥ 1% after 6 month treatment in patients with Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled on Oral Antidiabetics (OADs)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients with Hb A1c &lt; 7.5%,

        -  To evaluate the rate of hypoglycaemia (symptomatic, severe)

        -  To evaluate the middle dose of insulin per product - Insuman Basal, Insuman Comb,
           Insuman Rapid after 6 month treatment

        -  To evaluate the change in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) after 6 month treatment

        -  To assess the overall safety

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of education courses in Diabetes Schools (% of correct answers
           after second test compare to the testing of the initial level)
