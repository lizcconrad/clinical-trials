    <textblock>
      This is a phase I single center dose escalation study with an extension at the best available
      dose to determine the tolerability of inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs) when given to
      adult patients undergoing non-myeloablative HLA-identical sibling donor peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) transplantation for the treatment of a high risk malignancy. Up to 5 dose cohorts
      will be tested. Once the tolerable dose is determined for iTregs, enrollment will continue
      with an additional 10 patients using sirolimus/Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to gain further safety information and to provide pilot data in
      this treatment setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Co-enrollment in University Of Minnesota protocol MT2001-10 is required and transplantation
      will be according to that protocol with iTregs administered the morning of day 0 followed no
      sooner than 4 hours later by the PBSC transplantation.

    <description>Administered 10 x 10^8 iTregs/kg or best available dose using sirolimus/MMF as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Immunosuppression will consist of a combination of sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Sirolimus will be administered starting at day -3 with 8mg-12mg oral loading dose followed by single dose 4 mg/day. MMF will be administered starting on day -3 at a dose of 3 gram/day divided in 2 or 3 doses. Intravenous (IV) route between days -3 and +5, then may change to PO between days +6 and +30. Stop MMF at day +30 or 7 days after engraftment, whichever day is later, if no acute GVHD.</description>
