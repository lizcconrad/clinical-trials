      The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of gingival fissures according to
      the type of brush used, soft and medium.

    <textblock>
      Gingival recession constitute a functional and aesthetic problem that affects much of the
      population. One of the possible causes refers to a traumatic brushing. Individuals who have
      an excessive tooth brushing can cause injuries to your gums, such as abrasions and fissures.
      These lesions have been considered subrogated outcomes of gingival recession noninfectious.
      The literature only reports and case series showing the gingival fissures, which were once
      associated with traumatic occlusion.

      This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the gingival fissures according to the type of
      brush used.

    <description>This study took standardized photographs every 2 or 3 days during two periods of 28 days for evaluation of gingival fissures. These were measured by application of a disclosing solution of plaque on teeth and gums of the participants. The application developer board is safe, without contra-indications in the literature and facilitates visualization of gingival lesions and plaque.</description>
