      -  This study attempts to elucidate whether stroke patients with dysphagia have reduced
           diaphragm movement during voluntary coughing, and also during deep inspiration and
           expiration than stroke patients without dysphagia.

        -  This study will also compare various spirometric measurements with the diaphragmatic
           motions.

      Stroke is a debilitating condition that can impair multiple functions, including swallowing.
      Stroke patients with dysphagia, are known to have reduced cough due to multiple mechanisms
      and this can impair their expectorate function. This can lead to accumulation of sputum and
      mucoid, ultimately resulting in aspiration pneumonia. Stroke patients, especially those with
      dysphagia, are also known to have expiratory muscle weakness and weak cough than healthy
      controls. Stroke patients are also known to have reduced diaphragm movement than healthy
      subjects. Sonography is a useful tool that can easily and reliability measure diaphragm
      movement. Whether stroke patients with dysphagia have reduced diaphragm movement than those
      without dysphagia and whether this affects voluntary cough have not been reported yet.

      This study attempts to evaluate diaphragm movements during voluntary cough in stroke patients
      with dysphagia and determine whether this reduced diaphragm movement correlates to their peak
      flow meters during voluntary cough.
