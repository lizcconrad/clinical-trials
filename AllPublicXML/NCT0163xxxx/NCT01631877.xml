    <textblock>
      After successful screening the cases of cirrhosis of liver irrespective of the etiology who
      have non tumor portal vein thrombosis will be enrolled. The baseline Doppler parameter will
      be recorded and the patient will be randomized into either interventional (acenocoumarol) or
      placebo group along with first five days of subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin inj.
      Enoxaparin in the interventional arm and placebo injection in the control arm. Every 3
      monthly the Doppler screening for recanalization of portal vein thrombus will be done with
      monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR)with target INR 2-3. Both the groups will
      receive the therapy for one year irrespective of the Doppler findings in relation to portal
      vein thrombus re-canalization.Then one year drug free monitoring will be done in both the
      groups as per the primary or secondary outcome. .

    <description>Patients will receive enoxaparin 100mcg/kg for 5days along with acenocoumarol 2mg with titration of dose to maintain a target INR of 2-3.intially the INR will be monitored twice weekly with gradual escalation of dose to achieve target INR.After achieving the target INR this is to be repeated every 4th weekly. The Doppler Ultra Sonography screening will be done every 3monthly to assess the recanalization of portal vein thrombus but the medications will be continue for one year irrespective of recanalization.</description>
