  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if OLT1177 Gel is safe and can be tolerated when
      given as a single dose and multidose to a defined area of one knee of healthy subjects.

      OLT1177 Gel is being developed for the topical treatment of pain and inflammation emanating
      from musculoskeletal and certain skin inflammatory conditions.

      This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of OLT1177 Gel in healthy
      subjects when given as single-dose or multi-dose applications. The study will be conducted in
      two parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A, approximately 18 healthy subjects in 3 dose
      escalating cohorts will be randomized to receive a single dose of the investigational drug (5
      subjects OLT1177 Gel and 1 subject placebo gel). Upon completion of Part A, a new subject
      population of approximately 18 subjects in 3 dose escalating cohorts will be randomized in
      Part B of the study. Subjects will receive a total of 8 doses over 3 consecutive days given 6
      hours apart while awake during the day and will be followed for up to 30 days for safety
      assessment.
