  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that Non Hodgkin lymphoma is using T helper 2 pathways. So
      that the investigators decided to study of cytokines related to T helper 2 pathways. It is
      well known that parasites and allergic situations also use T helper 2 pathways. Because that
      the investigators excluded the patients have parasites and allergic situations. All the
      patients were over 18. The investigators included the patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma
      which new diagnosed. It is observational study. The investigators took blood before
      chemotherapy and four months later. The investigators did not interfere with which
      chemotherapy will be given to patients. This decision was belong to hematologist or
      oncologist who will treat the patient.

    <time_frame>This study ended within 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure 31 patients and 27 healthy person's Interleukin 4 and Interleukin 10 levels as pg/mL at the beginning of the study. We determined all of the patients IPI score, LDH (U/L), crp (mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin (gr/dL), lymphocyte count in per µL, albumin (gr/dL) before the treatment. We wanted to check whether there is any correlation between well known prognostic markers (LDH, crp, albumin, stage, ECOG performance status) and Interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 levels.</description>

        31 newly diagnosed non hodgkin lymphoma and 27 healthy controls. We studied IL-10 and IL-4
        in lymphoma group and healthy group and observed patients till end of study. We analised
        survival. We compared with IL-4 and IL-10 levels with prognostic factors.
