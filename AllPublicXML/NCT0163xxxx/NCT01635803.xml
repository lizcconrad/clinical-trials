  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of bevacizumab in the treatment
      of patients with macular edema secondary to a retinal vein occlusion (branch or central) as
      determined by the change in best-corrected visual acuity in the study eye from baseline to
      month 6.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: to compare the effectiveness and costs of 1.25 mg bevacizumab to 0.5 mg
      ranibizumab, given as monthly intravitreal injections during 6 months.

      Study Design: This will be a randomized, controlled, double masked, clinical trial in 296
      patients in 7 academic trial centres in The Netherlands.

      Study population: patients older than 18 years of age with macular edema secondary to a
      retinal vein occlusion and a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score between 78 and 20
      letters in the study eye.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be the change in BCVA in the study eye from
      baseline to month 6.

      Secondary outcomes will be amongst others the proportion of patients with a gain of 15
      letters or more and/or a BCVA of 20/40 or more at 6 months and the costs per quality adjusted
      life-year of the two treatments
