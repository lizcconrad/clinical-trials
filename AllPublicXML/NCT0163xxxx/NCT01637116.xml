      The primary purpose of this study is to identify and characterize novel diagnostic markers
      for autoimmune urticaria, a subset of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

      Additional aims: include the comparison of the clinical profiles of autoreactive, autoimmune
      and non autoreactive / autoimmune urticaria and the quality of life impairment in these
      subsets of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

        1. Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria and a negative ASST (= non-autoreactive
             chronic spontaneous urticaria)

          2. Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria with a positive ASST, who also test
             positive in a cell activating assay (BHRA OR CD 63 activation of healthy donor
             basophils) and who exhibit anti-FcεRI and/or anti-IgE autoantibodies (=autoimmune
             chronic spontaneous urticaria).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic spontaneous urticaria

          -  disease duration &gt; 6 weeks

          -  signed and dated informed consent

          -  age 18 years or older

          -  Non sedating antihistamines may be used on an &quot;on demand&quot; basis throughout the study,
             in case of high urticaria activity [&gt;50 wheals, and intense pruritus: urticaria
             activity score (UAS) of 6] or in case of an emergency. Patients may take either
             cetirizine 10 mg up to a maximum of 4 tablets per 24 hours or fexofenadine 180 mg up
             to a maximum of 4 tablets per 24 hours. The use of antihistamines and the reason has
             to be documented by the patient in the patient diary. Patients should avoid the use of
             antihistamines during the study and especially during the three days prior to skin
             testing

          -  for female with childbearing potential: female will have to use a safe method of
             contraception to prevent pregnancy and will have to agree to continue this method of
             contraception during the whole study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  intake of immunosuppressives 3 month before Screening Visit and during the course of
             the study. Immunosuppressives including ciclosporin, methotrexate, mycophenolate,
             azathioprine and cyclophosphamide need to be stopped at least 3 month before Screening
             Visit

          -  intake of corticosteroids (e.g. oral, injection) 1 month before Screening Visit and
             during the course of the study. Corticosteroids need to be stopped at least 1 month
             before the Screening Visit.

          -  Previous or present treatment with anti-IgE-antibodies including omalizumab (Xolair)

          -  age below 18 years

          -  use of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), doxepin, leukotriene
             antagonists (e.g. montelukast, trade name: singulair), H2 antihistamines (e.g.
             cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine), sulphasalazine, dapsone, tranexamic acid,
             warfarin, heparin during the last 4 weeks before the Screening Visit and during the
             course of the study.

          -  pregnancy, lactation or planned pregnancy during the study

          -  mentally incapacitated subjects

          -  patients protected by the law (adults under guardianship, or hospitalized in a public
             or private institution for a reason other than the study, or incarcerated)

          -  patients suffering from urticaria vasculitis
