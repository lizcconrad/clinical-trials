  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the performances of Medasense's non-invasive pain monitoring is compared with
      standard pain related indicators, such as heart rate, galvanic skin response, etc. , and with
      a subjective pain level assessment. The subjective pain level is assessed by the
      anesthesiologist when the patient is under general anesthesia and by the patient and a nurse
      in post anesthetic care unit (PACU).

      The study is based on recording and analyzing the subject's physiological signals, while
      recording painful events, medication dosing and different clinical signs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is an unpleasant sensation, ranging from slight discomfort to intense suffering. Since
      pain is a subjective phenomenon, it has frequently defied objective, quantitative
      measurements. Today, in order to measure pain, subjective uni-dimensional scales are used to
      quantify pain. One of the most common scale used to rate a patient's pain intensity is the
      visual analog scale (VAS), usually scored from 0 to 100. Hitherto, those scales are based on
      the subjective evaluation of pain by the patient.

      During anesthesia the patient cannot communicate and therefore the verbal or other report is
      impossible. Therefore, due to misrepresentation of the existence or extent of pain, care
      providers may fail to estimate the correct measure of pain and give too much or too little
      medication. A scoring system of pain level is therefore needed. That is the problem
      Medasense's system tries to approach.

      In this study investigators intend to test and analyze the performances of Medasense pain
      monitor by comparing its results with standard pain related indicators and with subjective
      patient's pain level assessment. The patient's pain level will be assessed by the
      anesthesiologist during surgery based on known pain stimuli, medications administered and
      clinical signs, and by the PACU nurse and patient's reports, when the patient is in recovery.
