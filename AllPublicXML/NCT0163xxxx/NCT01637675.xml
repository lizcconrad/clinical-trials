  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) is a water-soluble derivative of tanshinone IIA
      isolated as the main pharmacologically active natural compound from a traditional Chinese
      herbal medicine,the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge known as Danshen. Danshen has
      been known for the function of improving body functions such as activating blood circulation
      and removing blood stasis according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Danshen
      and its various formula products including STS have been long-time widely used in oriental
      countries, especially China to treat various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases for its
      pharmacological actions, including vasodilatation, anticoagulation, anti-inflammation, and
      free radical scavenging,with negligible adverse effects observed.

      The investigator's objective is to evaluate whether STS exhibits beneficial effects on
      pulmonary hypertension. This is a randomized, controlled, multicentre clinical trial study.
      90 patients with pulmonary hypertension will be enrolled in this study.
