    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the restoration of the
      sagittal balance and the improvement of the Quality of Life for patients with adult
      scoliosis, treated with a polyaxial system (PASS® LP system) during the 2 years after a
      spinal fusion surgery.

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the correlation between:
the correction of the Sagittal Vertical Alignement (SVA), expressed in centimeters - SVA is the distance between C7 plumbline and the posterior of the superior endplate of S1)
the improvement of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is the positive difference of the preoperative score and the postoperative score - expressed in % or a score (/50)</description>

    <description>Sagittal parameters are evaluated by:
