  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that short-term low dose cyclophosphamide therapy will be effective
      in resolving inflammation in patients with late phase antibody-mediated rejection refractory
      to current standard of care treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of de novo donor specific antibody-mediated
      rejection. Optimizing baseline immunosuppression (calcineurin inhibitor (CNI),
      anti-proliferative agent, and anti-inflammatory) is considered foundational but is
      insufficient. Pulse steroids are routinely used. A number of immunosuppressive approaches
      have been tried in uncontrolled trials. The strongest evidence, at least for early
      antibody-mediated rejection (&lt; 6 months from transplant), exists for plasmapheresis, with or
      without low dose IVIg, or high dose IVIg alone. However, as noted in a recent FDA workshop,
      &quot;while the literature suggests that [these agents] have evidence of efficacy for the
      management of acute antibody-mediated rejection, and could be considered as standard of care,
      treatment regimes have not been standardized or optimized.&quot; Moreover the evidence supporting
      efficacy of this approach in late, as opposed to early antibody-mediated rejection is
      distinctly lacking.
