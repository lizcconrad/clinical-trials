    <textblock>
      Well-regulated glycosylation is essential for the normal development of the nervous system.
      Altered expression of glycosyltransferases with resulting dysregulated glycosylation of
      neuroblastic cells might lead to the development of NB. The
      β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase III (B4GALNT3) exhibits GalNAc transferase activity to
      form the GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc or LDN) structure. The Drosophila B4GALNTA, homolog of
      human B4GALNT3, has been suggested to regulate the neuronal development. By
      immunohistochemical studies, we demonstrated that the expression of B4GALNT3 correlated well
      with histological grade of differentiation in NB tumor samples. Since well differentiated
      tumors usually carry a better prognosis, we thus speculate that expression of B4GALNT3 in
      tumor tissues can a favorable prognostic factor of NB.

      To explore the role of B4GALNT3 in the prognosis of NB, we propose the following project with
      two specific aims:

      Aim Ⅰ: Establishing the significance of B4GALNT3 in the prognosis of NB: We plan to collect
      90 NB tumor samples, and evaluate the RNA and protein expression levels by Q-PCR, Western
      blot, and immunohistochemistry in the tumor samples. The results will be compared with the
      other clinicopathological and biological factors of NB. Also the expression levels of
      B4GALNT3 in tumor tissues will be correlated to the patients' outcome to clarify whether
      B4GALNT3 could be a prognosis marker of NB.

      Aim II: Clarifying the effects of B4GALNT3 on NB cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. For
      further strengthening the prognostic role of B4GALNT3 in NB, NB cell phenotype and behavior
      changes after overexpression or knock-down of B4GALNT3 are evaluated by in vitro assays as
      well as by a nude mice xenograft model.

      In summary, if our project can establish the role of B4GALNT3 expression in NB, we may
      further subclassify the NB patients, and give the NB patients more appropriate therapies to
      improve patients' outcome. Furthermore, B4GALNT3 could potentially serves as a therapeutic
      target in the future.
