  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single center, double arm study aiming at the comparison of 2
      commercial neuromuscular block reversal drugs: Neostigmine (Cooper S.A.) and Sugammadex
      (MSD). A faster recovery from neuromuscular block is expected for patients receiving
      Sugammadex and this protocol is of high importance for anesthesia of morbid obese patients
      during bariatric surgery.
