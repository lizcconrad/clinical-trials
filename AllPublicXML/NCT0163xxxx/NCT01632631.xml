  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ongoing technological advances, especially in the field of image processing, have refined
      medical simulations to offer life-like replications of medical and surgical procedures in a
      variety of specialties. Patient-specific image data are incorporated into these simulations,
      and transformed into a 3D model. This enables the practitioner and his/her team to perform
      and practice 'real' cases on a virtual patient prior to performing the real procedure on the
      actual patient. This new technology has been referred to as 'patient-specific' rehearsal,
      also 'mission' or 'procedure' rehearsal.

      Research has already proven that simulated patient-specific rehearsal of a carotid artery
      stenting procedure may enhance surgical and team performance.

      The PROcedure rehearsal software can now also be used to practice patient-specific
      endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms (EVAR). The ability to rehearse a
      challenging and complex procedure like EVAR may not only influence device selection based on
      preoperative planning, but also improve the technical performance of the surgeon/radiologist
      and the awareness and communication within the entire endovascular team. However, further
      research is needed to evaluate if this new technology may enhance clinical safety and
      efficiency, i.e. if patients actually benefit from physicians and team members conducting
      patient-specific rehearsals of EVAR interventions.
