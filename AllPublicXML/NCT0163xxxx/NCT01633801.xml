  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humidified high flow nasal prong oxygen therapy is a method for providing oxygen and CPAP.
      The delivery of high flows decreases dilution of the inhaled oxygen and, by matching
      patient's peak flow, allows accurate delivery of the set FiO2 throughout the whole
      inspiratory phase. In addition, a flow-dependent effect of continuous positive airway
      pressure, possibly due to an air entrainment mechanism, has been documented in healthy
      volunteers and in patients with COPD.

      The investigators working hypothesis is that the use of post-extubation CPAP delivered via
      nasal cannulae in infants less than 18 months, post-bypass surgery will have better PaCO2
      values than infants extubated on to oxygen therapy.

    <textblock>
      After CICU admission, infants with no bleeding, normothermic and hemodynamically stable will
      be switched from PRVC to SIMV+PSV (10-15cmH20) which should be maintained for 4 hours. An
      arterial gas analysis will be performed after 20 minutes. Infants with normal gas-exchange
      are gradually weaned from mechanical ventilation At each weaning step an arterial
      hemogasanalysis is performed after 20 minutes, to assess if the decreased ventilatory support
      is tolerated. Increased work of breathing and respiratory acidosis (ph&lt; 7.3 or pCO2 &gt; 60
      mmHg) are considered criteria to withhold the weaning process. After a 4 hour period on
      SIMV+PSV the child should be switched to PSV for 30 minutes and then extubated. The following
      extubation criteria should be reached:

        -  Satisfactory blood gases with PCO2 under 45mmHg, pH greater than 7.30.

        -  Fractional inspired oxygen concentration of 65% and or less than the baseline value

        -  Adequate respiratory frequency according to age without dyspnea

      At this point criteria for extubation are reached. Once extubation has taken place the child
      will be placed either on traditional oxygen therapy or high flow nasal cannulae according to
      randomization.
