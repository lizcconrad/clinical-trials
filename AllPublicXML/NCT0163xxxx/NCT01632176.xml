  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) study is a small scale test of the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of a brief motivational interview-style intervention. The intervention
      took place in the pediatric emergency departments by a trained interventionist and will
      followed an intervention algorithm developed by a team of dating abuse and brief intervention
      experts. The research design is as follows: the investigators will randomize youth ages 12-19
      years old to one of two groups: one group who receives the intervention (N=~18), and the
      other which does not (N=~18). The investigators compared changes in outcomes from baseline to
      1-month follow-up for those in both groups. The investigators looked at outcomes including
      dating abuse-related knowledge, attitudes about the use of violence to resolve conflict, and
      dating abuse behavior (perpetration and/or victimization).

      Statement of study hypothesis: Youth who receive the intervention will show improvements in
      dating abuse-related knowledge, attitudes and behavior that are maintained for 1 month, while
      those in the comparison group will show no similar change.
