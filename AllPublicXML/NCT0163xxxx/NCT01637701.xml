    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the perioperative and postoperative characters of
      plasmakinetic enucleation of the prostate(PkEP) with bipolar TURP(B-TURP) for BPH patients
      with large prostate.

      Despite the availability of numerous minimally invasive alternatives, monopolar transurethral
      resection of the prostate (TURP) remains the most frequently performed operation for benign
      prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) with small to moderate size prostates. Nevertheless, TURP for
      large prostates is associated with various complications and unsatisfactory long-term
      results. B-TURP and PkEP have both been proved to have more favorable postoperative outcomes
      than monopolar TURP. But whether B-TURP or PkEP is better remain controversial. We aim to
      compare the perioperative and postoperative characters of PkEP with B-TURP for BPH patients
      with large prostate. Moreover, we evaluate the long-term results of both approaches.

    <description>At the end of both procedures, a 22F three-way Folley catheter was inserted and continuous bladder irrigation was performed. Irrigation was discontinued when the catheter drainage became clear, and the catheter was removed 6 h later.Two experienced urologists who were unaware of the surgical modality used decided bladder irrigation and catheter removal for all cases.</description>
