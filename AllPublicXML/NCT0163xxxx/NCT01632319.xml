    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of 2 different therapy courses
      for undergraduate college students who binge drink and experience depressive symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening visit (2 Â½ hrs) to confirm eligibility for the study, all participants will
      receive 8 weekly, 1-hour, individual sessions therapy with a counselor. Participants will be
      randomly assigned, by chance, like the flip of a coin, to the therapy course they will
      attend. In one of the therapy courses, students are asked questions about their drinking and
      receive personalized feedback about it, and are taught coping skills for their depressive
      symptoms. In the second course, students are also taught coping skills for their depressive
      symptoms but they may or may not talk about alcohol consumption depending on the students'
      preference. So, both courses teach the same coping skills for depressive symptoms but include
      different levels of focus on alcohol.

      Participants will also complete 2 follow-up visits, at the end of the 8 sessions and then
      again 4 weeks after completing treatment. These will involve filling out some questionnaires
      and completing a few neuropsychological tests (these questionnaires and neuropsychological
      tests will also be completed during the screening visit).
