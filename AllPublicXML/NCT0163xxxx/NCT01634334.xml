  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if real-time feedback (lights/sounds) from small
      smoke particle monitors and brief coaching will encourage parents to reduce young children's
      secondhand tobacco smoke exposure in their home.

      The purpose of this efficacy study is to test whether children's home secondhand tobacco
      smoke exposure (measured by cotinine &amp; nicotine assays, fine particulates and reports of
      smoking in the home and/or home smoking bans) can be reduced by using custom particle
      monitors to provide real-time feedback to household residents plus brief advice/praise.
