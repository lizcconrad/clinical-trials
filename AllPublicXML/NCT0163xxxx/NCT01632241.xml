      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of belimumab
      in adult patients of black race with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; lupus).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants receive stable standard therapy for lupus in addition to receiving either
      placebo (no active medicine) or belimumab. The controlled period of the study is 52 weeks.
      The random assignment in this study is &quot;2 to 1&quot; which means that for every 3 participants, 2
      will receive belimumab and 1 will receive placebo. Participants who successfully complete the
      52-week study may enter into a 6-month open-label extension. All participants in the
      open-label extension receive belimumab plus standard therapy.

             (ACR) criteria

          -  Have active SLE disease defined as a SELENA SLEDAI score &gt;= 8 at screening

          -  Have 2 unequivocally positive autoantibody test results defined as a positive
             antinuclear antibody (ANA) test [i.e., titer &gt;= 1:80 by human epithelial cell line 2
             (HEp-2) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA)]
             and/or a positive anti- double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) (&gt;= 30
             international units [IU]/milliliter [mL]) serum antibody test as follows:

               -  From 2 independent time points within the study screening period. Screening
                  results must be based on the study's central laboratory results, OR

               -  One positive historical test result and 1 positive test result during the
                  screening period.

        Historical documentation of a positive ANA test (e.g., HEp-2 IFA or EIA) or anti-dsDNA (eg,
        anti-dsDNA by any validated commercial assay) must include the date and type of the test,
        the name of the testing laboratory, numerical reference range, and a key that explains
        values provided as positive versus negative OR negative, equivocal/borderline positive).
        Only unequivocally positive values as defined in the laboratory's reference range are
        acceptable; borderline values will not be accepted.

          -  On a stable SLE treatment regimen consisting of any of the following medications
             (alone or in combination) for a period of at least 30 days prior to Day 0 (i.e., day

                  fixed within the range of 7.5 to 40 mg/day (prednisone or prednisone equivalent).
                  For those subjects on alternating day doses of steroids, use the average of 2

                  cases obtain a blood sample for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol
                  simultaneously to confirm. Diagnostic levels for FSH and estradiol vary by
                  specific laboratories/assays;

               -  OR is of child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by
                  serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening and urine hCG test
                  prior to dosing AND agrees to use one of the contraception methods for 2 weeks
                  prior to the day of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
                  point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 16 weeks following
