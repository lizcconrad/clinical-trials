      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR405838 through the
           characterization of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).

        -  To assess biological activities in patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma during MTD
           cohort expansion.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR405838.

        -  Biomarkers in association with SAR405838.

        -  Anti-tumor activity in response to SAR405838.

        -  Food effect on SAR405838 PK.

        -  Compliance with SAR405838 treatment.

        -  Cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) activity.

      Total duration of study participation for each patient will be one month screening followed
      by treatment until precluded by toxicity, noncompliance, progression, or death.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor for which no
             further effective standard treatment is available. Patients with lymphomas may be
             enrolled.

          -  For dose escalation, tumor type that has high biomarker prevalence without molecular
             confirmation of biomarker status, or any tumor type with molecular confirmation of
             biomarker status; For MTD cohort expansion, only dedifferentiated liposarcoma will be
             included.

          -  Presence of locally advanced or metastatic disease with at least one measurable
             lesion.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Age &lt;18 years.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &gt;1.

          -  Life expectancy &lt;12 weeks.

          -  Unstable brain or leptomeningeal disease based on history and physical examination.

          -  Inadequate organ functions, positive pregnancy test.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Any anti-cancer drug therapy within 2 weeks (8 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosoureas)
             or 5 half-lives of the drug prior to study treatment, whichever is shorter, prior to
             study treatment.

          -  Unwillingness, if not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, to abstain from sexual
             intercourse or employ an effective barrier or medical method of contraception during
             the study drug administration and follow-up periods.

          -  Recent (3 months) history of acute pancreatitis.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
