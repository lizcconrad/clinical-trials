          -  Female subjects must be either postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically
             incapable of childbearing, or effectively practicing an acceptable method of

          -  Female subjects who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or plan to become pregnant during the
             study or within 24 weeks following the last dose of the study drug

          -  Subject has a high risk of infection (eg, subjects with leg ulcers, indwelling urinary
             catheter, persistent or recurrent chest infections, and subjects who are permanently
             bedridden or wheelchair bound)

          -  Subject has a concurrent malignancy or a history of malignancy. Subjects who have been
