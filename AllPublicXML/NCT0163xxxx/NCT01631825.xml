    <measure>Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Vital Signs, and Laboratory Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 55 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of the long-term SPM 962 treatment was examined based on the incidence and severity of AEs, vital signs, and laboratory parameters.
AEs of special interest (1-3) are defined as below:
sudden onset of sleep
obsessive-compulsive disorder or impulse-control disorder
hallucination, delusion
Application site reaction is scored as -, ±, +, ++, +++, or ++++. More + indicates a greater severity of symptoms. The worst score obtained throughout the evaluation period was to be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3 Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 54 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 3 sum score (on state).
UPDRS is a scale for monitoring Parkinson's Disease-related disability and impairment. The UPDRS consists of the following four sub-scales. Part 1: Mentation, Part 2: Activities of Daily Living, Part 3: Motor, Part 4: Complications. Part 3 assesses 14 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>UPDRS Part 2 Sum Score (Average of on State and Off State)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 54 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 2 sum score (average of on state and off state).
UPDRS sub-scale Part 2 assesses 13 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 1 sum score.
UPDRS sub-scale Part 1 assesses 4 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 54 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 4 sum score.
UPDRS sub-scale Part 4 assesses 11 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score.
A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

    <measure>The Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr Severity of Illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 54 weeks after dosing.</time_frame>
    <description>Change (LOCF) from baseline in the Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr Severity of Illness. The Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr criteria are measured on the following 8-point scale for staging: 0, No signs of disease; 1, Unilateral disease; 1.5, Unilateral plus axial involvement; 2, Bilateral disease without impairment of balance; 2.5, Mild bilateral disease with recovery on pull test; 3, Mild to moderate bilateral disease, some postural instability, physically independent 4, Severe disability, still able to walk or stand unassisted; and 5, Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided.

AEs of special interest (1-3) are defined as below:
sudden onset of sleep

hallucination, delusion
Application site reaction is scored as -, ±, +, ++, +++, or ++++. More + indicates a greater severity of symptoms. The worst score obtained throughout the evaluation period was to be assessed.</description>

        <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 3 sum score (on state).
UPDRS is a scale for monitoring Parkinson's Disease-related disability and impairment. The UPDRS consists of the following four sub-scales. Part 1: Mentation, Part 2: Activities of Daily Living, Part 3: Motor, Part 4: Complications. Part 3 assesses 14 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

          <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 2 sum score (average of on state and off state).
UPDRS sub-scale Part 2 assesses 13 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>
