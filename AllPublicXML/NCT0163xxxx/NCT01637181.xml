  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical randomized controlled trial, comparing 2 endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
      techniques in patients with insufficiency of the great saphenous vein (GSV). There are
      multiple EVLA devices available, with different wavelengths. In the Netherlands, 940 nm Diode
      and 1470 nm Nd:Yag laser are the most frequently used devices. Both devices also proven to be
      equally effective in occluding the GSV. However, little is known about differences in
      patient-related outcomes. Therefore, the primary outcomes of this comparative clinical trial
      of 940 nm and 1470 nm EVLA, are pain scores, patient satisfaction and scores of health
      related and varicose-specific questionnaires. The secondary outcomes are complications and
      effectiveness of the treatment. It is thought that possibly the 1470 nm ELVA will give lower
      pain scores and higher patient satisfaction than 940 nm EVLA. No differences are expected in
      complication rate and effectiveness between the two treatments.

      * Study type: Interventional. Randomized comparative clinical trial..

        -  Outcome measures:

             -  Primary study outcomes: Patient reported outcomes: 1. Pain score and use of
                painkillers, assessed with a numeric rating scale (NRS) of pain. 2. Treatment
                satisfaction, assessed with a NRS of satisfaction. 3. Health related quality of
                life, assessed with Dutch translated Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ)
                and EQ-5D questionnaire.

             -  Secondary study outcomes: 1. Number of patients with adverse events. Major
                complications: deep and superficial venous thrombosis (embolic events), nerve
                injury, skin burns, and (sub)cutaneous infections. Minor complications: ecchymosis
                and hyperpigmentation. 2. Obliteration of varicose vein and/or absence of reflux (&gt;
                0.5 sec. of retrograde flow) along the treated segment of the GSV. This is measured
                using US examination.

        -  Outcome measures time frame:

      Follow-up of one year, with outcome measures at baseline, 1 week, 3 months and 1 year post
      treatment.

      * Focus of the study: Varicose great saphenous veins (GSV)

        -  Intervention information:

             -  Intervention name: endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)

             -  Intervention type: 1. EVLA with 940 nm Diode laser 2. EVLA with 1470 nm Nd:Yag
                laser

             -  Arm information: both interventions are active comparators.

        -  Locations:

      Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, The Netherlands
