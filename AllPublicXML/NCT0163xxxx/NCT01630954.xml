    <textblock>
      Hydatidiform mole is a common complication of pregnancy with an incidence of 1in 400
      pregnancies in India. Although this is a benign condition , it is having the malignant
      potential too. A repeat curettage after evacuation of hydatidiform mole was generally
      advocated till 1990s. A thorough curettage at the time of initial evacuation was not
      performed because of larger size of uterus and risk of perforation. Subsequently a number of
      studies assessed the usefulness of repeat curettage and found it was unnecessary and not cost
      effective . However all these studies are retrospective in design and conducted in developed
      countries where hydatidiform mole is diagnosed earlier because of wider use of
      ultrasonography. Thus there is a need to perform a well designed prospective study to compare
      the effectiveness of single evacuation with double evacuation in treatment of hydatidiform
      mole for prevention of Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia.This study compares the
      effectiveness of single evacuation versus double evacuation for treatment of hydatidiform
      mole for prevention of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia .

    <description>In single evacuation group women will be treated by suction evacuation and curettage is performed at the end of evacuation in one sitting. An ultrasound will be done later to examine completeness of evacuation. If there is significant amount of residual molar tissue or persistence of heavy bleeding a repeat curettage will be done . Women will be followed up with serum beta hcg 1 week after the evacuation and then weekly till the titer is negative. After three consecutive negative titre beat HCG estimation will be done at two weekly interval.</description>
