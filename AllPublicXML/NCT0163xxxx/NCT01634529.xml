      A first in human study:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of V158866 in healthy
      male subjects To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of V158866 in healthy male subjects To
      assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of V158866 by determining whether V158866 inhibits fatty
      acid amide hydrolase (FAAH ) in healthy male subjects
