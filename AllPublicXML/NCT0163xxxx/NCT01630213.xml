    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) is a randomized clinical trial in
      20,000 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin
      D3 (2000 IU) or fish oil (1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids) reduces the risk of developing
      cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these
      illnesses. This ancillary study (VITAL-Echo) is being conducted among participants in VITAL
      and will examine whether vitamin D compared to placebo: (1) reduces left ventricular (LV)
      mass in elderly individuals as measured with 2-dimensional echocardiography and (2) improves
      LV systolic and diastolic function as measured with tissue Doppler echocardiography.

    <textblock>
      Recognition of the biological effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular function has been
      growing. The main objective of the parent trial (VITAL) is to evaluate the effects of vitamin
      D on cardiac events but is focused on atherothrombotic events and does not specifically
      address vitamin D effects on LV mass. In ambulatory individuals, LV mass is a key cardiac
      structural feature and increases in LV mass are frequently accompanied by diastolic
      dysfunction. This study leverages the existing infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial to
      perform cardiac imaging studies on a subset of subjects who will be randomized to vitamin D3
      (n=500) or placebo (n=500). Echocardiography is a noninvasive, widely accessible tool to
      evaluate cardiac structure and function. Cardiac echo imaging visits will take place at
      baseline (pre-randomization), and then after 2 years, at the Massachusetts General Hospital
      (MGH). The acronym VITAL-Echo reflects the link to the parent VITAL trial and an ancillary
      investigation of vitamin D versus placebo on LV mass and function as measured by
      echocardiography. The effect of fish oil supplementation on these parameters will be
      evaluated as a secondary endpoint, thereby taking advantage of the factorial design of the
      parent trial.
