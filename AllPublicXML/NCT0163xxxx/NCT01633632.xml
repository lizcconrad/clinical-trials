      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hatha Yoga can improve the chances of a
      successful smoking quit attempt.

      While many smoking cessation interventions have been studied, even the most successful
      interventions result in less than 40% abstinence from smoking at 6 months. Most people
      attempt to quit multiple times before maintaining long-term abstinence from tobacco. Research
      into interventions to improve quit rates and decrease smoking prevalence is a high priority
      for multiple organizations. Yoga is an attractive non-pharmacological option because it can
      be used safely during pregnancy and lactation, can be combined with other pharmacologic and
      non-pharmacologic treatments, and can be continued well past the smoking cessation date to
      combat withdrawal symptoms and cravings. There is a critical need for innovative and
      effective methods for tobacco control that focus on both prevention and cessation.

      This project will be broken into two stages. The first stage will aim to pilot test yoga
      techniques for feasibility and acceptability. Recruitment and retention strategies will be
      tested and participant satisfaction will be evaluated. Preliminary measures of smoking
      abstinence and withdrawal symptoms will be conducted.

      The second stage of this study will be a randomized trial to compare smoking abstinence with
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), CBT + yoga, or yoga alone.
