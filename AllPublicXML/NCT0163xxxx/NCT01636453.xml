  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra Liberty Stent System as adjunctive
      treatment to embolic coils for wide-neck, saccular, intracranial aneurysms in the internal
      carotid artery (ICA). The Liberty Stent System is an implantable device comprised of a stent
      and delivery system designed as an adjunct to embolic coils in the treatment of wide-neck,
      saccular, intracranial aneurysms. It has three components: an implant, an introducer sheath
      and a delivery wire assembly. The implant component is made of superelastic and biocompatible
      nitinol tubular material. Patients presenting with wide-neck, saccular, intracranial
      aneurysms in the internal carotid artery (ICA) from the cavernous segment to the carotid
      terminus (including the paraclinoid, ophthalmic, hypophyseal and posterior communicating
      segments) will receive stent assisted coiling by the Penumbra Liberty Stent with any approved
      embolic coils currently on the market. Wide-neck aneurysms are defined by a neck ≥4mm or a
      dome-to-neck ratio &lt;2. Each patient will be followed and assessed for 2, 6 and 12 months
      after enrollment.
