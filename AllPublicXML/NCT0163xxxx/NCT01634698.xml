    <textblock>
      The relative-dose-response test (RDR) is considered to be the most accurate method for
      evaluating vitamin A nutritional status (VANS) in patients suffering from liver disease, as
      it infers the reserves of the vitamin in the liver. However, for the RDR test to reflect VANS
      in patients suffering from chronic liver disease, factors inherent to the disease need to be
      considered, such as possible malabsorption, advanced age, a drop in synthesis and/or the
      release of retinol binding protein (RBP), which would result in an inadequate response to the
      RDR test. Thus, the objective of present study is to assess the adequacy of two different
      protocol for using the RDR test in patients with cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Methods: The sample group was comprised of 178 patients at Federal University of Rio de
      Janeiro University Hospital (111 men) with several etiologies of liver cirrhosis at different
      stages in the progression of the disease. They were sorted into two groups, according to the
      retinyl palmitate dosage (1500 IU or 2500 IU) received at T0 (blood sample taken following a
      12-hour fast). Following supplementation, the investigators took further blood samples five
      and seven hours later (T5 and T7). The investigators assessed VANS via concentrations of
      serum retinol and RBP, as well as by way of the RDR test. The cutoff points the investigators
      used for denoting inadequacy in the indicators retinol and RDR were, respectively, &lt; 1.05
      µmol/L and ≥ 20%. To classify the degrees of severity of the disease the investigators used
      the criteria established by Child &amp; Pugh (1973).

    <description>Therapeutic response is evaluated by means of circulating serum retinol, 5 and 7 hours after the administration of vitamin A. The RDR was calculated by the following formula, using the values of serum retinol in the three times of blood collection (Loerch et al., 1979), expressed in percentages:
RDR (%) = [(A0-Ax) / Ax] x100 where A0 is the serum retinol at time 0 (fasting) and Ax is the serum retinol 5 or 7 h after administration of vitamin A. It was used as the RDR cutoff ≥ 20%, indicating indirect hepatic reserve inadequate</description>
