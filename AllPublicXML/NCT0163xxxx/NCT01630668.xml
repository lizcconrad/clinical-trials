      Background: In recent years, probiotics have shown promise in treating a variety of diseases.
      Previously, the investigators have reported on the clinical efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri
      NCIMB 30242 in improving the lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic adults.

      Objective: The purpose of the study is to determine the lipid lowering efficacy of a
      One-a-Day probiotic supplement capsule containing Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242 over 12
      weeks in subjects with hypercholesterolemia.

      Design: The study design is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm,
      multi-centre study. The study will last a total of 14 weeks, including a 2-week run-in period
      and a 12-week intervention period.
