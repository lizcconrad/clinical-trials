    <measure>Investigator Overall Satisfaction With the Device Using a 5-Point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated the overall satisfaction with the device using a 5-point scale where 1=definitely dissatisfied with the device to 5=definitely satisfied with the device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction With Breasts Using the BREAST-Q Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated satisfaction with their breasts using the BREAST-Q. Summary scores were computed by summing the score of each response and transferring them to a 0 (worst) to 100 (best) scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Evaluation of Whether the Implant is Palpably Distinguishable From the Tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator examined the breasts and evaluated whether the implant was palpably distinguishable from the tissue using a 5-point scale where 1=implant very easy to distinguish from the tissue to 5=implant indistinguishable from the tissue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Capsular Contracture Evaluated by Four-Grade Baker Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Interim analysis: 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated capsular contracture (lining of cells formed around the device as the body's response to a foreign object) using the Four-Grade Baker scale where: Grade I= Breast is normally soft and looks natural, Grade II= Breast is a little firm but looks normal, Grade III=Breast is firm and looks abnormal or Grade IV= Breast is hard, painful, and looks abnormal. The percentage of participants in each Baker Grade is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Local Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Interim analysis: 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants experiencing local complications (in the area of the implant) is reported.</description>
