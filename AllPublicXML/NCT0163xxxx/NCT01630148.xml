    <textblock>
      The use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains grossly underused for women
      who undergo gynecologic surgery for benign conditions world wide and especially in developing
      countries including our region. Having a research in our locality for the first time might
      raise awareness of the importance of VTE prophylaxis.

      Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), also referred to as venous
      thromboembolic events (VTE), are two major complications after gynaecological surgeries that
      can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of VTE after gynaecologic
      surgery varies depending on the method used for diagnosis. The rate of clinical DVT is
      estimated to be 3% after gynaecological surgery if no thromboprophylaxis was used. The rate
      of VTE assumed to decrease to 0.4% if Low molecular weight heparin was used as a
      thromboprophylaxis.

      According to our knowledge there are no published researches on the effect of the new second
      generation Low molecular Weight Heparin Bemiparin as a thromboprophylaxis after benign
      gynaecological surgery in comparison to a control group.
