  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the safety degree of the patient's gait, to detect
      the reason for the fall and quantify the biomechanical parameters related to fall. This study
      also aims to evaluate the effect of different rehabilitation treatments and their effect on
      the risk of falling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients suffering from motor disabilities as a result of orthopedic or
      neurologic impairments will be tested at the gait and motion laboratory. Each patient will be
      secured with a ceiling-mounted safety harness and will walk on the path wearing passive
      light-reflecting markers and surface electrodes. High-speed cameras will record the subject's
      movements and the markers will be tracked to produce data of joint angles, velocities and
      accelerations. Dynamic EMG will be recorded from various muscles.

      During the examination, the gait of the subjects will be disturb by either (i) a visual or
      sound signal that requires the subject to stop immediately, or (ii) walking different
      terrains, or (iii) tying a string to the foot and pulling it shortly to induce a trip.
