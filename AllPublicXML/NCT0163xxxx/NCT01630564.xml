      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the highest tolerated dose of T
      cells that can be safely given to patients whose cancer has returned after a UCBT.

  <detailed_description>

      You have had a UCBT. A small amount of the previously infused cord blood was frozen. This
      saved cord blood will be treated at the MD Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory with interleukin-2
      (IL-2) and clinical beads to produce and help generate the needed T cells. This will take
      about 2 weeks. When the product is ready, you will be given the expanded cord blood T cells
      as an infusion through your central venous catheter (CVC).

      Cord Blood T Cell Infusion:

      You will be assigned to a dose level of cord blood T cells based on when you joined this
      study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group
      will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were
      seen. This will continue for up to 3 dose levels, until the highest tolerable dose of cord
      blood is found.

      You will receive the cord blood T cells through your CVC. You will be given standard drugs to
      help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how
      the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Tests:

      Before the cord blood T cell infusion:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to test for cytomegalovirus
           (CMV), and to see how well the transplant has taken.

      After the cord blood T cell infusion:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and
           breathing rate).

        -  You will have a pulse oximetry test to check the amount of oxygen in your blood. For
           this test a clothespin-shaped clip will be placed on your finger for about 1 minute.

      One day after the cord blood T cell infusion:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the infusion, including graft versus host
           disease (GVHD - a condition in which transplanted tissue attacks the body into which it
           is transplanted).

        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for CMV.

      One time a week for the first 3 weeks after the cord blood T cell infusion:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the infusion, including GVHD.

        -  Blood (4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for CMV.

      At 1 month (+/- 7 days) after the cord blood T cell infusion:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the infusion, including GVHD.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to test for CMV, and to
           learn if and how well the transplant has taken.

        -  You may have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of the disease. To
           collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and
           a small amount of bone and bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

        -  You may have imaging scans to check the status of the disease and/or to check for
           possible infections.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At about 45 days (+/- 7 days) after the cord blood T cell infusion and when you are taken off
      study:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the infusion, including GVHD.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to test for CMV, and to
           learn if and how well the transplant has taken.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for about 100 days after the cord blood T cell infusion. You may be
      taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if there is not enough cord blood to infuse,
      if it cannot be infused due to infection/contamination, if you have any intolerable side
      effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine post-transplant follow-up visits,
      if your transplant doctor decides it is needed.

      This is an investigational study. The cord blood T cell expansion procedure is not FDA
      approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
