      Selected 400 cases of women with primary breast cancer who were treated with operation
      randomly, then detect the expression of CDK5RAP2 of cancer tissue. At the same time randomly
      selected 100 women with primary breast cancer who were under neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Detect
      the expression of CDK5RAP2 before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
