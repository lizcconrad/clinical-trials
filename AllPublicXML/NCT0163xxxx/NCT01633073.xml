  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare two single-use laryngeal mask
      airways with a provision of a gastric drain tube allowing for evacuation of gastric contents,
      the i-gel and the LMA Supreme, in pediatric patients undergoing positive pressure
      ventilation. The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the i-gel will not
      be significantly different clinically (higher) when compared with the LMA Supreme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the LMA Supreme and i-gel in children having surgery.
      The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the i-gel will not be
      significantly different clinically (higher) when compared with the LMA Supreme. Airway leak
      pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which equilibrium is reached.
      The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, feasibility of use during positive
      pressure ventilation, ease of gastric tube placement, and complications (airway related,
      gastric insufflation, and trauma) will also be assessed.
