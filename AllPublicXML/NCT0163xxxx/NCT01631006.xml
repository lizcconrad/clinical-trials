  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiac disease, is a cause of
      disability including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and sudden death, with an annual
      mortality varying from 1% to 6%. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is extremely common among
      patients with established cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atrial
      fibrillation and when present may contribute to worse cardiovascular outcome. Although
      patients with HCM do not necessarily have typical characteristics of patients with OSA, such
      as obesity and increasing age, there is recent evidence that OSA is extremely common among
      patients with HCM, with a prevalence ranging from 32% to 71%. The presence of OSA among
      patients with HCM is independently associated with worse structural and functional impairment
      of the heart, including atrial and aorta enlargement, worse New York Heart Association
      functional class, and worse quality of life. Therefore, the recognition and treatment of OSA
      is a new area of research that may impact in the management of patients with HCM.
