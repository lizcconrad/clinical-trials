  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the newest strategies to combat micronutrient deficiencies is the biofortification of
      staple foods, where higher levels of minerals are obtained through breeding of staple crops.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate zinc absorption from a rice biofortified with zinc when
      compared with a control rice fortified with zinc just before consumption.

    <measure>Fractional absorption of zinc</measure>
    <time_frame>33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Fractional absorption of zinc is estimated by using the double isotope tracer ratio technique by administering 67Zn as oral and 70Zn as intravenous stable isotopes.The urinary enrichment with both isotopes is measured in a spot urine sample by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.</description>
