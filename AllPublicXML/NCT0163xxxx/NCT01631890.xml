      Consecutive patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. All
      patients with gastric varices with no history of gastric variceal bleed (Group C) will
      undergo Endoscopic ultrasound and Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy at baseline, at the end of
      first year and at the end of study.

      The patients who presented to Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences with gastric variceal
      bleed or develop Gastric Variceal bleed during hospital stay will be randomized into Group -A
      (conventional Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy + Glue) and Group-B (Endoscopic Ultrasound
      followed by Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy+Glue) therapy for gastric varices. Total 90
      patients will be enrolled and randomized into group A and Group B after resuscitation and
      urgent Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy with standard therapy for bleeding gastric varices to
      achieve hemostasis.

    <description>N Butyl cyanoacrylate will be used for achieving initial hemostasis during active gastric variceal bleed and during follow up gastric variceal obturation. Endoscopic injection will be performed intravariceally using a therapeutic endoscope and a steel hubbed catheter, with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The cyanoacrylate will be injected without dilution with lipiodol. The tip of the endoscope will be coated with lipiodol to prevent sticking of glue to the endoscope. The injection catheter is primed with saline solution followed by injection of glue in 1ml aliquot to fill the dead space followed by injection of sterile water to flush the glue into the varix. The needle is withdrawn immediately after the glue injection to prevent tissue adherence.</description>

    <description>Patients will be stabilized by giving i/v fluids, blood and blood products. Injection terlipressin will be given to all patients in a bolus dose of 2mg within 30 minutes of admission to the hospital. This would be followed by 1mg i/v 6hrly and will be continued for 5 days. If terlipressin cannot given then inj.somatostatin 500mcg IV bolus followed by 250mcg/hr continuous infusion for 5days.</description>
