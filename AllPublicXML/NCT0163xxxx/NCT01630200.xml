  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a low grade systemic inflammatory
      process. Systemic inflammation is hypothesized to maintain cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality in COPD. Early changes of vascular integrity can be detected via markers of
      subclinical atherosclerosis.

      Selective Inhibition of phosphodiesterase subtype 4 describes a promising therapeutic option
      in COPD with beneficial impact on lung function and exacerbation rate. Moreover, an
      anti-inflammatory effect of phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition was confirmed by recent data.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor
      Roflumilast on firstly surrogates of subclinical atherosclerosis and secondly markers of
      systemic inflammation in the peripheral circulation of patients with stable chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <measure>Change from baseline in carotid femoral-Pulse Wave Velocity at month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Carotid femoral-Pulse Wave Velocity (cf-PWV) will be measured non-invasively with the well validated SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Wave propagation time will be calculated by the system software, using an ECG-gated reference frame. Aortic PWV is defined as the distance between two recording sites (i.e. common carotid- and femoral artery) divided by the wave propagation time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Reactive Hyperemia Index at month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial dysfunction will be assessed by means of the EndoPat device (Itamar Medical Ltd). This validated system measures the pulse wave amplitudes at the tip of both index fingers. The dominant arm will be occluded for 5 minutes by a sphygmomanometric cuff. After cuff deflation the pulse wave amplitude will be assessed to finally calculate the ratio of pulse wave amplitude before and after cuff-induced hyperemia. The so called reactive hyperemia index represents endothelial dysfunction at the level of conduit as well as resistance vessels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Augmentation Index at month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The curve of the peripheral pressure wave will be recorded from the radial artery. Augmentation index (Aix) will be calculated from the generated central aortic pressure waveform via pulse wave analysis function. To correct for respective influences, Aix will be adjusted for a heart rate of 75 bpm. Appropriate intra observer validity will be assured via an operator index ≥ 80.</description>
