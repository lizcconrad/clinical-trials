    <textblock>
      Annual study to investigate influenza vaccine (flu vaccine) developed for the 2012/2013
      season for the prevention of influenza infection. The immunizing effect is being
      investigated, as well as its tolerability and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open, baseline-controlled study in two age groups: adults and elderly. The subjects will
      be screened within 14 days prior to or at Visit 1 (Day 1). At Visit 1 (Day 1) subjects will
      be vaccinated after blood sampling for baseline serum antihemagglutinin antibody titration.
      Subjects will be asked to record local and systemic reactions daily on a diary at home for 72
      hours after vaccination. One week later (Visit 2, Day 8) the subjects will return to the
      study site to hand in the diary and for the assessment of safety and tolerability
      (reactogenicity and overall inconvenience). Three weeks after vaccination (Visit 3, Day 22)
      the subjects will return to the study site for blood sampling to assess immunogenicity and
      for the assessment of safety and tolerability.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Willing and able to give informed consent and able to adhere to all protocol required
             study procedures.

          2. Men and women aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years or ≥ 61 years of age at the day of study
             vaccination.

          3. Being in good health as judged by medical history, physical examination (if needed)
             and clinical judgment of the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Known to be allergic to eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin or any other constituent of
             the vaccine.

          2. A serious adverse reaction after a previous (influenza) vaccination.

          3. Presence of any significant condition that may prohibit inclusion as determined by the
             investigator.

          4. Seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccination or laboratory confirmed seasonal or
             pandemic influenza infection within the previous six months before study vaccination
             or planned vaccination during the study period.

          5. Having any condition which suppresses the immune system and autoimmune disorders.
