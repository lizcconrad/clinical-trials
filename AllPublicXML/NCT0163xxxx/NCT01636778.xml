  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of SB-497115-GR to raise platelet counts
      in thrombocytopenic patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (platelet count &lt;80,000
      /μL, suggestive of compensated cirrhosis) to a level desirable to initiate antiviral therapy
      and to assess the ability of SB-497115-GR to maintain platelet counts at a level sufficient
      to minimise dose reductions of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy
      with the expectation that a lower rate of Peg-IFN dose reduction and omission will translate
      to a higher rate of sustained viral response.

After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

          <description>Participants completing Part 1 continued on the same dose of eltrombopag received in Part 1 (dose that effectively raised platelets to &amp;gt;=100 Gi/L) in combination with antiviral therapy (Peg-IFN alfa-2a/RBV or Peg-IFN alfa-2b/RBV) for a duration of 48 weeks. Dose adjustments of eltrombobag were permitted up to 50mg QD in order to maintain an appropriate platelet count.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death; was life threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death; was life threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Shift From Baseline in Severity Grades for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Per Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) in Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of clinical chemistry parameters were taken at intervals in Part 1. Clinical chemistry parameters included albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ALT, aspartate amino transferase (AST), total bilirubin, calcium, creatinine, potassium, sodium, and uric acid. Per DAIDS toxicity table, the grade ranges for each parameter are as follows: Grade (G) 0=none, 1=mild; G2=moderate; G3=severe; G4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Shifts From BL in Severity Grades for for Hematology Parameters Per DAIDS in Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were taken at intervals throughout the study. Participants with the worst-case shift from BL in Part 1 are reported, per severity grades by DAIDS, for levels of hemoglobin (low=anemia), lymphocytes (low=lymphocytopenia), total neutrophils (low=neutropenia), and white blood cells (low=leukocytopenia). Per the DAIDS toxicity table, grade ranges for each parameter are as follows: Grade (G) 1=mild; G2=moderate; G3=severe; G4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Shifts From BL in Severity Grades for for Hematology Parameters Per DAIDS in Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were taken at intervals throughout the study. Participants with the worst-case shift from BL in Part 2 are reported, per severity grades by DAIDS, for levels of hemoglobin (low=anemia), lymphocytes (low=lymphocytopenia), total neutrophils (low=neutropenia), and white blood cells (low=leukocytopenia). Per the DAIDS toxicity table, grade ranges for each parameter are as follows: Grade (G) 1=mild; G2=moderate; G3=severe; G4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

            <description>Participants completing Part 1 continued on the same dose of eltrombopag received in Part 1 (dose that effectively raised platelets to &gt;=100 Gi/L) in combination with antiviral therapy (Peg-IFN alfa-2a/RBV or Peg-IFN alfa-2b/RBV) for a duration of 48 weeks. Dose adjustments of eltrombobag were permitted up to 50mg QD in order to maintain an appropriate platelet count.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of hematology parameters were taken at intervals throughout the study. Participants with the worst-case shift from BL in Part 2 are reported, per severity grades by DAIDS, for levels of hemoglobin (low=anemia), lymphocytes (low=lymphocytopenia), total neutrophils (low=neutropenia), and white blood cells (low=leukocytopenia). Per the DAIDS toxicity table, grade ranges for each parameter are as follows: Grade (G) 1=mild; G2=moderate; G3=severe; G4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Assessed as Abnormal (Clinically Significant [CS] and Not Clinically Significant [NCS]) for 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>The number of participants with an ECG status of normal, abnormal, CS, or NCS, as determined by the Investigator, was reported. Normal= all ECG parameters within accepted normal ranges. Abnormal= ECG findings outside of normal ranges. CS= ECG with a CS abnormality that meets exclusion criteria. NCS= ECG with an abnormality not CS or meeting exclusion criteria, per Investigator, based on reasonable standards of clinical judgment.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>

            <description>Participants with an initial platelet count of &lt;80 Gi/L, received eltrombopag at 12.5 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, if the platelet count was &lt;100 Gi/L, participants underwent dose escalation to 25 mg QD (up to 2 weeks). If platelet counts still remained &lt;100 Gi/L, further dose escalations to 37.5 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 50 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) were allowed. Participants who achieved platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L during Part1 (maximum of up to 9 weeks) were eligible to enter the Antiviral Treatment Period (Part 2), whereas those who failed to reach platelet counts &gt;=100 Gi/L were discontinued from eltrombopag and progressed to the Follow-up Period.</description>
