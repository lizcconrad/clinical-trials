      The key objective of the Leuven growing-into-deficit (GID) follow-up-study is to test the
      hypothesis that children with a congenital heart disease (CHD) show more neurocognitive
      impairment at the second follow-up at 7 years old than at the first follow-up at the age of
      4, compared to healthy controls.
