    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to know the level of expression and activation state of
      different transcription factors of the STAT family (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) in
      the hematopoietic cells from tocilizumab treated patients.

    <description>The levels of phosphorylation of STATs on different subsets of leukocytes will be assessed by flow cytometry at baseline (before Tocilizumab administration) and at the indicated time (6m) after initiation of treatment. Results will be expressed as Mean of Fluorescence Intensity. To perform the analysis the investigators will use conjugated monoclonal antibodies against STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6</description>

          -  Non-pregnant, non-nursing female, and females of child-bearing potential must use a
             reliable means of contraception, eg, physical barrier (patient and partner),
             contraceptive pill or patch, spermicide and barrier, or intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, the patient must have a negative urine at
             screening and baseline.

          -  If patients are receiving an oral corticosteroid, the prednisone dose or its
             equivalent must be ≤10 mg/day and stable for ≥28 days prior to screening.

          -  If patients are currently taking a permitted non-biologic DMARD, the dose must be
             stable for ≥7 weeks prior to baseline. Willing to receive oral folate or leucovorin if
             taking methotrexate.

          -  Patients who have been given written information about the study and have consented to
             data collection and review.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of autoimmune disease or inflammatory joint disease other than RA.

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives of
             investigational agent, whichever is longer) before starting treatment with Ro-Actemra®

          -  Pregnant women or nursing (breastfeeding) mothers

             major surgery within 6 months following randomization.

             (ie, largely or wholly incapacitated with patient bedridden or confined to wheel
             chair, permitting little or no self-care)

          -  Treatment with rituximab within 6 months before screening.

          -  Treatment with IV gamma globulin, plasmapheresis or Prosorba® column within months, or
             any investigational cell-depleting therapies before baseline.

          -  Immunization with a live/attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Any previous treatment with alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide or
             chlorambucil, or with total lymphoid irradiation.

          -  Treatment with:

        Intraarticular (IA) corticosteroids within 8 weeks prior to screening. Intramuscular (IM)
        or IV corticosteroids within 12 weeks prior to screening.

             monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Evidence of serious uncontrolled concomitant cardiovascular, nervous system, pulmonary

             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) or GI disease (including complicated

          -  Evidence of active malignant disease, malignancies diagnosed within the previous 5
             years (including hematological malignancies and solid tumors, except non melanoma skin
             cancer that has been excised and cured), or breast cancer diagnosed within the
             previous 5 years.

          -  Active TB requiring treatment within the previous 3 years. Patients previously treated
             for TB with no recurrence in the past 3 years are permitted. Patients who have a
             positive purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test and have not been
             adequately treated for TB must be treated for latent TB with isoniazid (INH) for 1
             month prior to enrollment whether or not they have been vaccinated in the past.
             Patients with a positive PPD that is ≥5mm at screening are not eligible for the study
             unless they begin treatment for latent TB with INH a minimum of 1 month prior to
             enrollment in the trial. The required total INH treatment duration is 9 months.
