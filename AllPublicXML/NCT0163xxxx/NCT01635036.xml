      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Eeva™ System is compatible with the Eeva
      12-well Dish.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate that the Eeva System Software successfully tracks the
      embryo images and identifies the timing of key developmental events using the Eeva 12-well
      Dish.

      This is a prospective, observational, blinded, single arm, nonrandomized, single center
      clinical study. Images of developing embryos and Eeva predictions will be blinded to
      embryologists and physicians

    <description>The clinical image data (embryos images) will be used to develop the Eeva System Software. The Eeva software validation will consist in comparing the specificity of the Eeva System Software Blastocyst Prediction from the Eeva 12-well Dish to the specificity of the Eeva System Software from the Eeva 25-well Dish (the specificity of the Eeva System Software from the Eeva 25-well Dish was previously determined during the Eeva System Study TST-1788-r).</description>

    <measure>Specificity and sensitivity and 95% confidence intervals of the Eeva System Software and the Embryologist Panel (also referred to as Panel) measurements will be computed.</measure>
