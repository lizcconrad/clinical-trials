    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of everolimus (Zortress®)
      in preventing antibody formation in patients with chronic failing kidney transplants.
      Everolimus (Zortress®) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
      prevention of rejection in kidney transplant.

      The primary objective for the study is to determine whether conversion of patients with
      chronic renal graft failure approaching dialysis to an everolimus-based regimen will prevent
      allosensitization. The secondary objective will be to determine whether conversion of
      patients with chronic renal graft failure to everolimus (elimination of calcineurin
      inhibitor) will delay the onset of dialysis.
