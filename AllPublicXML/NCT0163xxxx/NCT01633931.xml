        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis

          -  Failed external brace therapy defined as either (a) progression of the curve greater
             than 5 degrees at any time while undergoing external brace therapy, or (b) inability
             or unwillingness to comply with at least 16 hours per day of external bracing

          -  Skeletally immature (Risser Sign 0, 1, 2, or 3)

          -  In girls, either (a) pre-menarchal, or (b) post-menarchal by no more than 6 months

          -  Age between 10 and 15

          -  Primary Cobb angle greater than 25 degrees but not yet requiring spine fusion

          -  Candidate for surgical implantation of spinal instrumentation

          -  Patient resides locally with respect to the Investigator's clinic and is willing and
             able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

          -  Must sign informed consent to permit the use of personal health data

        Exclusion Criteria:

             implant

          -  Patients who require an MRI following implantation

          -  Skeletally mature (Risser Sign 4 or 5; or fused tri-radiate cartilage)

          -  Diagnosis of other musculoskeletal or developmental illness that might be responsible
             for the spinal curvature

          -  History of previous surgical treatment for AIS
