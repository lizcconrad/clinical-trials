  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this integrated analysis is to evaluate the clinical safety and
      efficacy of long-term treatment with darapladib enteric coated tablets, 160mg, as compared to
      placebo when added to standard of care in subjects with clinical manifestations of
      cardiovascular disease (chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) and post Acute Coronary Syndrome
      (ACS)). With respect to efficacy, the key purpose of this integrated analysis is to evaluate
      the effects of darapladib on the following endpoints: urgent coronary revascularization for
      myoacrdial ischemia, fatal/non-fatal stroke, time to subsequent Major Adverse Cardiovascular
      Event (MACE), and heart failure requiring hospitalization. The first occurrent of MACE, Major
      and total coronary events as well as the individual components of MACE will also be evaluated
      descriptively.

      The objective of the integrated safety analysis is to characterize the safety profile of
      darapladib in subjects with clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease (chronic
      coronary heart disease (CHD) and post Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)).

      The purpose of the integrated efficacy analysis is to test the effects of darapladib on
      select endpoints which are not part of the testing hierarchies associated with the individual
      studies, namely: urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia, stroke,
      subsequent MACE, and heart failure requiring hospitalization, For all other endpoints, the
      intent of the integrated analysis is to provide increased precision of the estimated effects
      of darapladib.
