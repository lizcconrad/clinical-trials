      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of I-PDT with Temoporfin for patients
      with Non-Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NR-NSCLC). Several clinical studies suggested
      that photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an effective treatment for patients with NR-NSCLC. PDT
      is a therapy where an external light source, such as laser, is used to activate a
      light-sensitive medicine to produce byproducts that can destroy cancer cells. In this study
      the investigators will use an experimental light sensitive medicine, Temoporfin, to perform
      interstitial PDT (I-PDT). In I-PDT, laser fibers are inserted into the tumor to activate the
      light-sensitive medicine.

    <description>The specific aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety of CT-guided I-PDT with Temoporfin on patients with NR-NSCLC. Patient safety will be the primary endpoint. The safety of the intervention will be assessed at 14 and 30 days post-therapy. The primary outcome will be occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAE).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eighteen years of age and older, male or female, of all races and ethnicities.

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

          -  Not a candidate for curative surgery.

          -  Not a candidate for curative concurrent chemoradiation therapy.

          -  Not a candidate or does not wish to receive curative radiation therapy.

          -  Not a candidate or does not wish to receive radiofrequency or microwave thermal
             ablation.

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; 2.

          -  The tumor is observable in CT with contrast.

          -  The tumor is accessible for unrestricted illumination of interstitial photodynamic
             therapy (I-PDT).

          -  Deemed likely to survive for at least 3 months.

          -  Patient is able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the
             study.

          -  If the subject is a female of childbearing potential, the subject is willing to take a
             pregnancy test and practice strict birth control (estrogen-containing oral
             contraceptives or an intrauterine device) throughout the study and for 3 months after
             Temoporfin administration. Women who have had a hysterectomy are exempt from these
             requirements.

          -  Subject is willing to remain in a controlled light exposure environment for a time
             period of at least 15 days.

          -  History of laboratory tests that meet the following criteria

          -  Hematocrit &gt;= 33%, hemoglobin &gt;= 11 g/dl

               -  Platelet count &gt; 70,000 per microliter

               -  White blood count &gt; 3,000 per microliter or ANC &gt; 1500 per microliter

               -  Creatinine: 0.8 to 1.4 mg/dL

               -  Serum chloride: 101 to 111 mmol/L

               -  Serum sodium: 136 to 144 mEq/L

               -  Liver function test: albumin, bilirubin (direct/conjugated), ALT (alanine
                  transaminase), AST (aspartate transaminade), GGT (gamma glutamyl transferase),
                  ALP (alkaline phosphatase) within normal limits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The tumor invades a major blood vessel.

          -  The tumor is not clearly shown on the CT image.

          -  The tumor size is larger than 5 cm when measured in a contrasted CT image according to
             RECIST v1.1.

          -  The location and extension of the tumor precludes an effective I-PDT.

          -  Patient with hypersensitivity to Temoporfin or to any of its excipients.

             derivatives of porphyrin).

          -  Patient has received prior PDT to the proposed treatment site within the prior 3
             months.

          -  Patient with known sensitivity to the CT contrast agent (Omnipaque), which would
             preclude the use of the CT contrast agent.
