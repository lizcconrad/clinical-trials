  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that education will improve exercise capacity, symptoms and
      quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition,
      the investigators are interested in determining how education might alter various chemicals
      in the blood and exhaled breath that reflect inflammation in the lungs and the body as a
      whole.

      The investigators plan to enroll 42 patients into this study, with half of them participating
      at each of the two sites, Vermont Lung Center at the University of Vermont in Burlington,
      Vermont, and at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Participants will undergo a
      series of measurements and tests at the beginning of the study, receive formal education
      about COPD over the next 2 weeks, return at 6 weeks for a brief refresher session, and
      finally return after 12 weeks for repeat measurement and testing as was done at the
      beginning. Participants will be asked to keep a diary of symptoms, medication, and exercise
      during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem worldwide, and is
      currently the third leading cause of death in the United Sates. Patients with COPD mainly
      complain of shortness of breath with daily activities and exercise. A key mechanism of
      dyspnea is dynamic hyperinflation, or air trapping, which results from the severe airflow
      limitation that characterizes the disease. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids may
      help, but these therapies are expensive and may have side effects. Pulmonary rehabilitation
      is very effective at reducing dyspnea and improving exercise tolerance, but it is not widely
      available to patients. We propose studying the effect of a simple breathing exercise known as
      pranayama, or yogic breathing. Our hypothesis is that the practice of pranayama will improve
      exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. We believe that the mechanisms involved will
      include reduced dynamic hyperinflation as well as beneficial effects on lung mechanics,
      inflammation and oxidative stress. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized, double
      blind, controlled trial of pranayama vs. usual care (education) in COPD patients. In Specific
      Aim 1, we will determine the effect of pranayama on exercise tolerance as measured by 6 min
      walk distance; in Specific Aim 2, we will determine the effect of pranayama on dynamic
      hyperinflation as measured by changes in inspiratory capacity before and after exercise; and
      in Specific Aim 3, we will determine the effect of pranayama on oxidative stress systemic
      inflammation, shortness of breath, and quality of life. The study is designed to be
      applicable to a wide variety of clinical settings, since it will involve two diverse clinical
      sites (Burlington, VT and Houston, TX), require minimal direct intervention, and engage
      participants in self-learning and practice. The data from this study will provide fundamental
      new insights into the mechanisms of action of pranayama, and will be critical in designing a
      large, multicenter trial to test the effectiveness of pranayama in patients with COPD.
