    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the diagnostic value of Xenetix-CT
      perfusion for the discrimination between well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC)
      and poorly/moderately differentiated HCC, in histo-pathologically proven HCC, and with the
      aim to cover the entire liver.

          <title>Severity of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score)</title>
          <description>Child-Pugh classification of severity of liver disease is evaluated according to the degree of ascites, the plasma concentrations of bilirubin and albumin, the prothrombin time, and the degree of encephalopathy.
Class A: well compensated disease
Class B: significant functional compromised
Class C: decompensated disease
For 7 patients, this score was missing.</description>

          <title>Permeability Surface According to Immunohistochemistry Parameter (CD31)</title>
          <description>CD31 is an immunohistochemistry marker of microvessel density. CD31 labelling was quantified and in case of positive quantification, classified in the following categories: 1-10%, 10-50% and &gt;50%. In case of absence of CD31 labelling, lesions were classified in the &quot;CD31 0%&quot; category.</description>
          <population>A total of 77 patients were analyzed for CT perfusion and immunohistochemistry parameters. A patient could have several lesions.</population>
