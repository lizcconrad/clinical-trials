  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has two components: component A is a cohort study to determine the in vivo efficacy
      of SP to clear and prevent malaria parasitaemia in asymptomatic pregnant women and component
      B is a cross sectional study of women delivering at the study hospitals to assess the
      effectiveness of SP-IPTp to reduce adverse maternal and birth outcomes in the current context
      of increasing SP resistance. Results of component A and B studies will be used to model the
      relationship between the prevalence of molecular markers of SP resistance, in vivo efficacy
      to clear parasite and the effectiveness of SP-IPTp and to develop guidelines for routine
      monitoring effectiveness of SP-IPTp as part of ANC surveillance.

      Study sites will include different levels of transmission and social factors affecting ANC
      attendance Damboa hospital in Borno state has a catchment area with pop of 231,573 with a
      semi arid climate and where malaria is mesoendemic. The expected number of patients is 15-25
      per week for new bookings Park Lane hospital serves a semiurban population. Malaria
      transmission is holoendemic and stable. 1400 women attend ANC services per month Women will
      receive SP-IPTp according to National guidelines and will be followed for 42 days to assess
      the therapeutic efficacy in parasitaemic women and to assess the ability to remain parasite
      free. PCR will be used to determine reinfection from recrudescence
