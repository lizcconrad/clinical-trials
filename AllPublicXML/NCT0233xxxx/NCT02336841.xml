  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test a novel guided self-help intervention for patients with
      Anorexia Nervosa. The 6-week intervention includes the use of self-help materials (i.e. a
      workbook and short video-clips) and weekly guidance from a peer mentor (i.e. a person
      recovered from Anorexia Nervosa). Self-reports will be completed at baseline, end of 6 weeks,
      and 6- and 12 months follow-up. Participants interested in taking part will be randomly
      allocated to one of two groups.

      This trial investigates whether a guided self-care intervention (Recovery MANTRA) is a useful
      addition to treatment as usual (TAU) for individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Recovery
      MANTRA, a 6-week self-care intervention supplemented by peer mentorship, is a module
      extension of the Maudsley Model of Treatment for Adults with AN and targets the maintenance
      factors identified by the cognitive-interpersonal model of the illness.

      Patients accessing outpatient services for AN are randomised to either TAU or TAU plus
      Recovery MANTRA. Outcomes variables include changes in body weight at the end of the
      intervention (primary) and changes in body weight and eating disorder symptoms at immediate
      and extended follow-ups (6-months and 12-months; secondary). Change is also assessed for the
      domains identified by the theoretical model, including, motivation, hope, confidence to
      change, positive mood, cognitive flexibility, therapeutic alliance and social adjustment.
      Feedback from peer mentors is gathered to understand the impact of providing guidance on
      their own well-being.

      Results from this exploratory investigation will determine whether a larger clinical trial is
      justifiable and feasible for this affordable intervention which has potential for high reach
      and scalability.
