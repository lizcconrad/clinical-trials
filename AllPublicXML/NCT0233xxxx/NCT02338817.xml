  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycogen storage disease (GSD) patients frequently experience periods of hypoglycemia,
      putting them at risk for several complications, such as hepatomegaly, adenomas, and
      cirrhosis. As of now, glycogen storage disease patients are limited to using finger stick
      glucose meters to monitor their glycemia at home. Diabetes Sentry, a non-invasive
      hypoglycemia detector designed like a watch, has been available for diabetic patients to
      non-invasively alert for hypoglycemia, but has never been tested in a GSD population. The
      investigators propose to test the accuracy of the Diabetes Sentry on patients with GSD types
      0, I, III, VI, and IX, by measuring their metabolic markers every two hours, as well as
      whenever the device alerts for hypoglycemia. If accurate, it could be a useful tool for GSD
      patients in managing hypoglycemia, both clinically and at home.

      As a participant the following will take place:

      The Diabetes Sentry device, which is non-invasive and is worn on the wrist will be used while
      an inpatient at the University of Florida Health &amp; Shands Hospital. Participants will be
      monitored for the duration of the observational period on the unit, an expected average will
      be 24 hours. The device is designed to alarm during periods of perspiration and drops in body
      temperature. When this occurs, a blood draw will be taken to test for glucose, lactate, and
      ketone values at those times if there is not an already scheduled clinical care blood draw
      for normal clinical care.

  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The device often failed to detect hypoglycemic episodes in glycogen storage disease patients
    and the rate of false positive alarms was high.
