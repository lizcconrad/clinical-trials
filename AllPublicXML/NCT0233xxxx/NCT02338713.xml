  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the intestinal absorption of calcium from a
      novel calcium carbonate-vitamin D3 chewable tablet formulation (calcium 500 milligrams (mg)
      and vitamin D3 1000 International Units (IU)) increases the amount of calcium excreted in
      urine and decreases parathyroid hormone (PTH) in serum as compared with Baseline.

      The drug being tested in this study was called Calcichew D3. Calcichew D3 was being tested to
      assess how it is processed by the body in healthy men and postmenopausal women. This study
      looked at lab results in people who take Calcichew D3.

      The study enrolled approximately 27 participants. All participants received the same
      treatment:

      • Calcichew D3 (calcium 500 mg and vitamin D3 1000 IU) chewable tablets All participants were
      asked to take one tablet each morning of the treatment period.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 44 days. Participants made 2 visits to the clinic, including one 7-day period
      of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.
