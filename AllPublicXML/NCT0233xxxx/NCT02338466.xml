  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) occlusions constitute the most severe stroke.
      Intra-venous thrombolysis with rt-PA within the first 4,5 hours is the only proven effective
      treatment. Prognosis is closely related to the recanalization rate that reaches only 30 to
      50%. A new therapeutic strategy consisting in a sequential intravenous (IV) thrombolysis by
      rt-PA followed by 50UI/kg of IV tenecteplase (TNK) has been proposed in case of no
      recanalization after rt-PA. A case series of 13 consecutive patients treated by this
      association has been published in 2011. A high rate of recanalization without hemorrhagic
      transformation increase has been reported. However, efficiency and safety of this therapeutic
      have to be assessed in a randomized multi-centric study. Such a study is of great interest
      since interventional neuroradiology has not already shown superiority regarding IV rt-PA.
      Moreover interventional neuroradiologists specialists are only available in major hospital
      and an IV sequential strategy could provide an interesting alternative.

      Main study objectives:

      Main Clinical Objective:

      Sequential thrombolysis should be associated with a significant better outcome at 3-month,
      assessed by the modified Rankin score (mRS).

      Main Radiological Objective:

      Sequential thrombolysis should be associated with a higher rate of recanalization (TIMI 2b/3)
      at 24-hour.

      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, national, randomized, biomedical study comparing two
      therapeutic strategies in ischemic stroke associated with proximal middle cerebral artery
      occlusion.

      Patients will be included in two randomized arms and the new sequential treatment approach
      (rt-PA + tenecteplase) will be compared with the standard treatment (rt-PA alone).

    <description>Patients treated by thrombolysis with rt -PA within 4h30 of the onset of symptoms to a proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion visible on a MRI 1 are pre- included. A second MRI ( IRM2 ) is performed between 1 hour and 1.5 hours after administration of rt-PA in the usual way .
After the treatment by rt-PA, if there is no recanalization (TIMI score: 0,1, 2a), the patient is included. A patient included will be randomized either in the arm &quot;rt-PA treatment only&quot; or in the arm &quot;rt-PA + tenecteplase treatment&quot;. If he is included in the arm &quot;rt-PA only&quot;, he will not receive any other treatment for the study.</description>
