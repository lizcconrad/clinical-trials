    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to exploratorily examine efficacy and safety in the patients
      with chemotherapy-naïve unresectable, advanced/recurrent colorectal carcinoma of KRAS
      wild-type who have been treated with 6 cycles (2 weeks/cycle) of first-line mFOLFOX6 +
      panitumumab combination therapy and then assigned to two groups i.e., a group receiving
      5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy and a group receiving mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab
      combination therapy.

      This open label study will exploratorily examine efficacy and safety of 5-FU/LV + panitumumab
      combination therapy or mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy in the patients with
      chemotherapy-naïve unresectable, advanced/recurrent colorectal carcinoma of KRAS wild-type
      who have been treated with 6 cycles [2 weeks/cycle (site visit)] of first-line mFOLFOX6 +
      panitumumab combination therapy The study will enroll approximately 100 patients. All
      patients will receive 6 cycles of Protocol Treatment [1]: mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination
      therapy [oxaliplatin (OXA): 85 mg/m2/day 1; levofolinate calcium (l-LV): 200 mg/m2/day 1;
      bolus 5-FU: 400 mg/m2/day 1; infusional 5-FU: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3; panitumumab: 6 mg/kg] once
      every two weeks. Then they will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one
      of the treatment groups.

        -  Group A (50 Patients): mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy, once every two weeks
           [oxaliplatin (OXA): 85 mg/m2/day 1; levofolinate calcium (l-LV): 200 mg/m2/day 1; bolus
           5-FU: 400 mg/m2/day 1; infusional 5-FU: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3; panitumumab: 6 mg/kg]

        -  Group B (50 patients): 5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy, once every two weeks
           [levofolinate calcium (l-LV): 200 mg/m2/day 1; bolus 5-FU: 400 mg/m2/day 1; infusional
           5-FU: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3; panitumumab: 6 mg/kg] This multi-center trial will be
           conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 12
           months.
