  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the ratio of lean mass losses over total body mass losses between
      patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy followed by physical activity training versus patients
      undergoing sleeve gastrectomy only
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess prospectively and objectively the potential benefits of a personalized
      and specific rehabilitation program designed for patients who undergone sleeve gastrectomy.
      This strategy will help to reduce fat mass and to limit lean mass loss, in order to prevent
      in the short term the overweight recurrence. Also,the improvement of physical and metabolic
      status is expected.
