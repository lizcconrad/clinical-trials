  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies giving radiation therapy to the liver in patients with uveal
      (eye) melanoma who have a specific chromosome loss (monosomy 3) or are DecisionDx Class 2 and
      therefore more likely to have their disease spread from the eye to the liver. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Early radiation to the
      liver may reduce the development of tumors in the liver and the overall risk of disease
      recurrence.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival in patients treated with prophylactic hepatic irradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Acute and late term toxicity and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy daily over 20 minutes on Monday-Friday for
      10 fractions over approximately 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
