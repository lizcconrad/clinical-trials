        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years old.

          2. Female.

          3. Histological diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) breast adenocarcinoma
             (ER&lt;1%, PR&lt;1% by (IHC) and HER-2 0-1+ by IHC or IHC 2+ and FISH or CISH negative per
             updated ASCO guidelines).

          4. No clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastasis.

          5. Presence of residual primary disease of at least 1.5 cm by U/S or MRI within 14 days
             preceding the last cycle of standard anthracycline and taxane-based neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy.

             Patients with synchronous synchronous bilateral cancer and unilateral multifocal or
             multicentric or bilateral disease breast cancer will be allowed provided histologic
             diagnosis of TNBC is found on all performed biopsies.

          6. Completion of standard anthracycline and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The
             use of platinum agents in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy is
             allowed.

          7. ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1

          8. Adequate Bone Marrow Function: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL or ≥1.5 x
             109/L; Platelets ≥100000/μL or ≥100 x 109/L; Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.

          9. Adequate Renal Function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or
             estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min.

         10. Adequate Liver Function:Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN or ≤ 2 x ULN in cases of
             known Gilberts syndrome; Aspartate and Alanine Aminotransferase (AST and ALT) ≤ 1.5 x
             ULN; Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

         11. For patients of childbearing potential: negative serum/urine pregnancy test and use
             accepted forms of non-hormonal contraception during the study period and up to 6
             months after treatment completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent anti-cancer therapy for current breast cancer (hormone therapy,
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy). Patients already included in another
             therapeutic trial involving an experimental drug.

          2. Pregnant or lactating women.

          3. Any prior history of invasive breast cancer.

          4. Any previous history of non-breast malignancies (excepted basal cell carcinoma or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) in the preceding 5 years.

          5. Known hypersensitivity to the study drug or excipients.

          6. Patients with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease or infection
             which could compromise participation in the study.

          7. Subjects unable to swallow oral medications.
