      The purpose of this study is to examine if an internet-based exposure therapy is effective in
      reducing excessive worry amongst patients who suffer from this problem.

      Trial Objectives: Primary objective is to investigate whether an Internet-based exposure
      therapy can effectively reduce the degree of excessive worry. The secondary objective is to
      a) investigate whether imagery based exposure is more effective than verbal exposure. b)
      investigate the cost-effectiveness of this treatment and c) to study if any variables could
      moderate/mediate the treatment outcome, such as metacognitions, degree of rumination or
      degree of depression.

      Trial Design: Randomized controlled trial with waitlist control, who also will recieve
      treatment after the first group has finished.

      Duration: Ten weeks

      Primary Endpoint: Change in worry symptoms from baseline to Week 10. Long term follow-up is
      also investigated (baseline to 4-months after treatment completion and baseline to 12-months
      after treatment completion).

      Efficacy Parameters: Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)

      Safety Parameters: Adverse Events is assessed weekly via the internet.

      Description of Trial Subjects: Patients &gt; 18 years old with a PSWQ score more than 56 points

      Number of Subjects: 140
