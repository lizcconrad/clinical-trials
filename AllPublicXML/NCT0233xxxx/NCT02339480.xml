  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is to penetrate and consummate the research mechanism of massage therapy on
      simple obesity. Latest researches indicate that the energy regulation network system of
      hypothalamus and metabolic disorders on adipocyte may be the pathological bases which result
      in obesity. The research group have firstly conducted effect studies of massage therapy on
      model of simple obesity rats and observed some neurobiological mechanism (whole effect
      mechanism), meanwhile, the team have discussed influences on the development of preadipocyte
      and function of endocrine with dynamic mechanical stimulation in vitro (local effect
      mechanism). This research aims at centering on the hypothesis that massage therapy can act on
      energy regulation network system of hypothalamus specifically, thus regulating the energy
      metabolic disorders. Then applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore
      whether patients with simple obesity exist abnormality on energy regulation network system of
      hypothalamus, ascertain mechanisms how massage therapy treat energy metabolism disorders of
      simple obesity, deepen mechanism study on how massage therapy prevent and treat obesity and
      enrich the clinical application's scientific connotation that massage therapy treat simple
      obesity.

      This project will divide in two groups,healthy volunteers and obesity group.Healthy
      volunteers do not accept any treatment while obesity group need accept massage therapy three
      times a week,18 times in total.And two groups will be checked by functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), Healthy volunteers for once and obesity group for twice(before
      treatment, obesity group's image of fMRI will compare with Healthy volunteers' and the image
      which is taken after treatment)
