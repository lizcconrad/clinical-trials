  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is highly prevalent in the society. The role of muscle tissues in this
      pathology has received increasing interest. Some studies have proposed the role of myofascial
      trigger points in this population. The purpose of the current clinical trial is to compare
      the effects of physiotherapy treatment consisting of an eccentric exercise protocol versus
      the same physical therapy program plus the addition of trigger point dry needling (TrP-DN) on
      pain and function in patients suffering from unspecific shoulder pain.

    <description>Patients will be asked to perform an eccentric loading exercise program for the shoulder musculature, particularly the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, to be performed on an individual basis twice every day. The therapeutic protocol will be applied for 5 weeks. In addition, within the second and fourth sessions, they will receive TrP-DN over active TrPs in the shoulder muscles</description>
