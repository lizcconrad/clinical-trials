  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung fluid absorption disorders are largely mediated by transepithelial Na+ reabsorption
      through alpha epithelial sodium channels (α-ENaCs) in alveolar epithelial cells. Increasing
      evidence has demonstrated that these lung disorders might be an important cause of neonatal
      respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) by influencing gas exchange or surfactant function,
      particularly in near-term and term infants. The SCNN1A gene, which encodes the α-ENaC, might
      predispose infants to NRDS. To explore whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
      SCNN1A are associated with NRDS, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the
      NRDS-associated loci in Han Chinese infants. Seven target SNPs were selected from the SCNN1A
      gene and were genotyped using the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction (iMLDR).
