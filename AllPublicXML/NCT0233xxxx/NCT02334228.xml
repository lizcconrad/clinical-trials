  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies targeting obesity in serious mental illness have reported clinically significant
      risk reduction, and non have been replicated in community settings or demonstrated sustained
      outcomes after intervention withdrawal. The researchers sought to replicate positive health
      outcomes demonstrated in a previous randomized effectiveness study of the In SHAPE program
      across urban community mental health organizations serving an ethnically diverse population.

      In this randomized, controlled study, 133 adults age 21 and older with serious mental illness
      (SMI) and poor physical fitness (BMI&gt;25, or &lt;10 minutes of exercise 2x over the past month)
      were randomized to either: a) In SHAPE Lifestyles (ISL) intervention or b) Health Club
      Membership and Education (HCME): consisting of a YMCA membership, educational materials on
      exercise and healthy diet, and an on-site introduction to the health club. The following
      three specific aims were addressed: 1) To compare ISL and HCME with respect to: a)
      participation in regular exercise and dietary change; (b) participation in preventive health
      care; and (c) improved fitness and health; (2) to compare ISL and HCME with respect to: (a)
      indicators of mental health and (b) personal self-efficacy; and (3) to explore differences in
      ISL and HCME with respect to (a) selected physical, metabolic, dietary, and community
      functioning secondary outcomes; and (b) the relationship of demographic variables and
      readiness to change to outcomes. ISL participants received a 6-month intensive program of
      one-to-one health mentoring, followed by a 3-month period of transitioning to self-directed
      individual and group programming, with assessments conducted at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months. If found to be effective, ISL will provide a practical approach to improving health,
      independent functioning, and longevity in disabled persons with SMI.
