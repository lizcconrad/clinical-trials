      3VM1001 is a topical cream that may be useful for the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis of
      the knee. This proof of concept study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
      to compare treatment with 3VM1001 cream to an inactive cream placebo. Subjects will
      self-treat for 30 days with investigational drug or placebo. Rescue medication with
      acetaminophen, up to 2g daily, is permitted. This study is intended to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of 3VM1001 topical cream, a copper-containing cream. Subjects will self treat
      with drug or placebo three times daily for 30 days. All subjects will have a total of three
      visits to the clinic and will complete a daily diary each day for the 30 days of treatment.
