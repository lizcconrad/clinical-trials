    <textblock>
      This study plans to to estimate the safety profile of the combination biotherapy regimen
      consisting of standard-dose interferon alpha-2b (HDI) and anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody,
      Pembrolizumab, for the neoadjuvant therapy of locally/regionally advanced/recurrent melanoma.
      Also, the objectives of this trial include the evaluation of prognostic and predictive
      biomarkers, radiologic preoperative response rate, pathologic response rate, progression free
      survival and overall survival. Up to 30 evaluable patients will be accrued.

      The study has 3 main phases:

      Induction Phase:

      Pembrolizumab I.V. infusion every 3-4 weeks for 2 doses (starting first week of HDI
      administration) given concurrently with HDI I.V. x 5 consecutive days out of 7 every week for
      4 weeks, followed by S.C. every other day 3 times each week for 2 weeks.

      This is followed by definitive surgery (week 6-8).

      Maintenance Phase (following recovery from surgery):

      Pembrolizumab I.V. infusion every 3 weeks given concurrently with HDI S.C. QOD TIW every week
      for 46 additional weeks.

          3. Melanoma belonging to the following stages:

               -  Tx or T1-4 and

               -  N1b, or N2b, or N2c, or N3 and

               -  M 0

             Pts are eligible for this trial either at presentation for primary melanoma with
             concurrent regional nodal and/or in-transit metastasis, or at the time of clinically
             detected nodal and/or in-transit recurrence and may belong to any of the following
             groups:

               -  Primary melanoma with clinically apparent regional lymph node metastases.

               -  Clinically detected recurrence of melanoma at the proximal regional lymph node(s)
                  basin.

                  are allowed if they are considered potentially surgically resectable at baseline.

             within 2 wks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

          4. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
