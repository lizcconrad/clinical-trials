    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SUN-131 1.5% TDS as
      compared with placebo TDS in the treatment of chalazion based on the proportion of subjects
      that have complete response. Complete response is defined as the absence of any significant
      clinical signs of a chalazion with possible scaring or skin defects resulting from healing of
      the chalazion allowed.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments in the affected
      eyelid:

        -  SUN-131 1.5% TDS (n=30)

        -  Placebo TDS (n=30)

      At baseline prior to application of the TDS an assessment will be performed on both the
      subject's eyes including the chalazion site itself.

      All subjects will return to the site on Days 8±1, 15±2 and 23±2 for evaluations. During the
      the 23±2 visit, a clinical evaluation will be performed to determine if the chalazion is
      still present.

      There will also be follow up on Day 29±3, and on Day 50 visit (study days 47 to 60) to
      evaluate the safety and durability of the effect of the SUN-131 1.5% TDS.

      Data review and safety assessments will be conducted by the medical monitor periodically
      throughout the trial and at the conclusion of the study.

             eyelid is diagnosed with a chalazion, the most inflammatory chalazion shall be
             selected as the study eyelid. Other eyelids containing a chalazion will not be treated
             with investigational product in this trial.

          -  Chalazion intended for study treatment presents no more than 3 weeks based on subject
             history.
