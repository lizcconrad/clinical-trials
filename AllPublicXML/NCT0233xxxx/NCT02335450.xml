  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of personalized physical activity coaching combined
      with the use of a physical activity monitor to support increased levels of daily physical
      activity in individuals with multiple sclerosis. All five participants will receive the
      intervention over the four week intervention phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with multiple sclerosis engage in less daily physical activity than the general
      population for a variety of reasons. This research project is intended to evaluate whether
      individualized coaching combined with the use of a Fitbit physical activity wristband monitor
      will improve physical activity levels in individuals with multiple sclerosis.

      Following admission into the study, participants will be visited once a week for four weeks
      at home by a physical therapist. The participants in consultation with the physical therapist
      will set daily physical activity goals for the following week and the participants will be
      taught how to monitor their daily activity using a Fitbit physical activity wristband.

      The goals of this study are to determine whether this intervention is effective in helping
      participants increase their levels of daily physical activity and their confidence that they
      can successfully engage in daily physical activity. In addition, there will be an evaluation
      of changes from pre-intervention to post-intervention in quality of life measures.

    <description>All five participants in the study will receive this intervention. The participants will be visited in their homes by a physical therapist once a week. The physical therapist will use a coaching technique called motivational interviewing to help the participant develop personal physical activity goals. The participant will discuss their physical activity challenges, and with the help of the physical therapist the participant will set up personal physical activity goals for the following week. The participant will be given a wristband physical activity monitor to wear during the day for four weeks to track their progress in meeting their activity goals.</description>

    <description>The participant will describe their unique physical activity challenges and their physical activity goals with the physical therapist. Using the technique of motivational interviewing, the physical therapist will work with the participant to help identify potential solutions to challenges and set realistic activity goals for the next week. Each week, the participant and the physical therapist will review the previous week's activity data, and the participant's reports of any challenges or problems they encountered in meeting their physical activity goals the previous week. The participant will identify new activity goals for the next week.</description>
