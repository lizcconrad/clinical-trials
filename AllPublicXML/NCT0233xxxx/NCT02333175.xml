  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the needs and provision of care for patients in the
      late stages of Parkinsonism and their carers in several European countries, to compare the
      effectiveness of different health and social care systems, and to lay the foundation for
      improved outcomes in this population. The investigators will undertake an in-depth assessment
      of patients and their care arrangements in a population recruited through networks in six
      European countries. The systems and procedures that are used in the provision of care will be
      reviewed through a systematic literature review, interviews and assessments of patients,
      carers and health care providers, and through a trial comparing assessment by a specialist
      with management suggestions, guidance and access to telephone advice to that of usual care.
      Through interviews, questionnaire assessment and review of current health-care and social
      care arrangement, the investigators will assess the needs, provision of care and use of
      health-care resources, and their impact on patient and carer outcomes in different countries.
      National and regional databases will also be interrogated to identify current practice and
      use of healthcare resources and drug usage. A systematic literature review of the evidence
      for effective management strategies, analysis of the study data, and evaluation of change in
      outcomes following specialist review will provide the basis for recommendations in the
      management of late stage Parkinsonism. The investigators will also evaluate potentially
      useful outcome measures for use in this patient group. In addition to charting the needs and
      current care provision for late stage Parkinsonism in different European countries, its cost
      and effectiveness, and an analysis of health-care and social care predictors of improved
      outcome, the project will produce a platform for the assessment of patients with late stage
      Parkinsonism, their current treatment and care provision, as well as guidelines on the
      management of this late disease phase.
