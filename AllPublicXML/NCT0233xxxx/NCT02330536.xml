  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become a standard technique for addressing
      all types of thoracic pathology. Insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the operated chest
      cavity could increase lung collapse and improve surgical field view. The actual thoracic
      pressure values may not be identical with the presetting on the insufflator display. This
      overshoot pressure during VATS may compromise cardiac and pulmonary function. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the effects of intrathoracic pressure overshoot during two-lung
      ventilation on the hemodynamic and respiratory function and clarify the relative safety of
      two different techniques of insufflation.
