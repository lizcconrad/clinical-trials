    <time_frame>120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be closely monitored throughout the 2-minute drug and placebo administration periods and for 120 minutes following treatment. Treatment may be stopped at any time at the request of the subject and/or the qualified investigator or delegate.
Safety and tolerability to S-1226 (8%) will be evaluated through the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, pulse oximetry, biochemistry and hematology testing, urinalysis, 12-lead ECG, physical examination, and pulmonary function (spirometry). These data will be recorded and descriptive statistics and change from baseline for safety parameters will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the efficacy of S-1226 (8%) in comparison to placebo. (evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the early asthmatic response (defined as a 20% fall from baseline FEV1 following allergen inhalation)</measure>
    <time_frame>30minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the early asthmatic response (defined as a 20% fall from baseline FEV1 following allergen inhalation), responder status which is achieving ≥ 25% reversal over placebo of the decrease in FEV1 from allergen challenge within 30 minutes after study treatment, maximum percent reversal of allergen-induced decrease in FEV1 in the first 30 minutes following study treatment administration, and the duration of the ≥ 25% reversal produced by study drug, defined as the interval after S-1226 (8%) administration during which the FEV1 is maintained at ≥ 25% above placebo.</description>

             Investigator) for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis.

          9. Subject is in general good health based on medical history and clinically acceptable
             results for the following assessments: physical examination, vital signs, and 12-lead
             ECG, as assessed by study physicians.
