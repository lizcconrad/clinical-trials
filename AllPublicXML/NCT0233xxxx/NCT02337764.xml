    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, long-term, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of long-term administration of TVP-1012 at 1 mg with levodopa in Japanese
      participants with Parkinson's disease.

      The study period will consist of a 2-week screening period and a subsequent 52-week treatment
      period. Participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion
      criteria at the start of the screening period (Week -2; Visit1) and also at the end of the
      screening period (Week 0; Visit 2) will be enrolled in the study, and will receive 1 mg of
      TVP-1012 once daily for 52 weeks, in an unblinded manner, from the day after Visit 2.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
