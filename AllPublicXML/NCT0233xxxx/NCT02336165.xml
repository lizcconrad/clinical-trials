      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter Phase 2 study of MEDI4736 with three
      non-comparative cohorts:

      Cohort A: 37 subjects with newly diagnosed unmethylated MGMT GBM will receive MEDI4736 every
      2 weeks in combination with standard radiotherapy.

      Cohort B: 30 bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2
      weeks as monotherapy.

      Cohort B2: 32 bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2
      weeks + bevacizumab every 2 weeks (10 mg/kg).

      Cohort B3: 32 bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2
      weeks + bevacizumab every 2 weeks (3 mg/kg).

      Cohort C: 17 bevacizumab-refractory subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2
      weeks in combination with continued bevacizumab.

    <textblock>
      Under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors. MEDI4736 is
      an experimental antibody that is made in the laboratory. Antibodies stimulating the immune
      system have been developed for treatment of human cancers. The idea behind developing this
      type of experimental drug is that stimulating the immune system could be a different way of
      preventing cancer growth or killing cancer cells.

      This study will also evaluate how much MEDI4736 is in the blood at various times, whether the
      immune system becomes activated following treatment and the effect of treatment on cancer.

      In subjects with newly diagnosed GBM (Cohort A), MEDI4736 will be administered with standard
      treatment which includes radiation following surgery. The idea to add MEDI4736 to standard
      radiation is that the radiation will cause cell death and release tumor proteins which will
      increase the immune activity of MEDI4736.

      Subjects with recurrent GBM and who have never been treated with Avastin (Cohort B), will
      receive MEDI4736 alone.

      In Cohorts B2 and B3, subjects with recurrent GBM and who have never been treated with
      Avastin will receive MEDI2736 in combination with standard or low dose Avastin respectively.

      Subjects with recurrent GBM and who have currently progressed on Avastin (Cohort C), will
      continue receiving Avastin in combination with MEDI4736. Avastin is another type of antibody
      that prevents the growth of blood vessels that feed the tumor. Despite Avastin being approved
      by the FDA for cancer based on tumor response, essentially all patients eventually progress
      due to resistance.

      The idea to treat cancer with MEDI4736, with or without Avastin, is to identify alternative
      treatment options for cancer, by stimulating the immune system to prevent cancer growth.

    <measure>Evaluation of patient neurologic function (NANO scale).</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic function of patients in each treatment cohort will be assessed using The Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) Scale: A Tool To Assess Neurologic Function for Integration in the Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria.
The NANO scale is an objective and quantifiable metric of neurologic function that incorporates direct observation/testing of eight relevant neurologic domains designed to be evaluated quickly during a routine clinic visit. The NANO scale is designed to complement subjective, patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life questionnaires.
For this study, the NANO scale will not be used to define clinical progression. Changes in level of function scores for each neurologic domain defined by the NANO scale will be descriptively summarized on an individual patient basis over time. For each cohort, the median survival of patients with and without significant neurologic decline as defined by the NANO scale.</description>
