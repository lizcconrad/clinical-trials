        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females 18 years of age or older.

          -  The sum of the clinical signs and symptoms scores of the target lesion is at least 4,
             including a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema and a minimum score of 2 for
             either scaling or pruritus.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of interdigital tinea pedis with lesions localized to the
             interdigital spaces or predominantly interdigital, but may extend to other areas of
             the foot.

          -  The presence of interdigital tinea pedis infection, confirmed by the observation of
             segmented fungal hyphae during a microscopic potassium hydroxide wet mount
             preparation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study
             period.

          -  Use of antipruritics, including antihistamines within 72 hours prior to baseline
             visit.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids, antibiotics or antifungal therapies within 2 weeks
             prior to baseline visit.

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or antifungal therapies within 1 month
             prior to baseline visit.

          -  Use of oral Terbinafine or Itraconazole within 2 months prior to baseline visit.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medication or radiation therapy within 3 months prior to
             baseline visit.

          -  Any known hypersensitivity to Naftifine Hydrochloride, or any component of the
             formulation.

          -  Confluent, diffuse moccasin-type tinea pedis of the entire plantar surface.

          -  History of significant or current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system
             disorder, organ disorder, or other medical condition that would place patient at undue
             risk by participation or could jeopardize the integrity of the study evaluations.

          -  Evidence of any concurrent dermatophytic infection of the toe nails or dermatological
             condition of the foot that may interfere with the investigator's evaluation of tinea
             pedis.

          -  Patients with a past history of dermatophyte infections with a lack of response to
             antifungal therapy.
