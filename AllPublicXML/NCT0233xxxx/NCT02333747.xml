    <textblock>
      The effect of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on the quality of recovery
      in patients undergoing thyroidectomy surgery remains unclear. Therefore, the investigators
      conducted this prospective, randomized, double-blind study to verify the hypothesis that
      pre-operative TEAS could improve the quality of recovery (QoR) after thyroidectomy surgery.

      Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is a form of non-invasive electrical
      stimulation that produces a perceptible sensation via electrodes attached to the skin. It has
      no risk of infections and can potentially be applied by medical personnel with minimal
      training. Clinical trials have demonstrated that TEAS reduces the consumption of
      intra-operative anesthetics and general anesthesia related side-effects.
