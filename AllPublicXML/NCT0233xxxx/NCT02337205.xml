    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to access the safety and tolerability of KX2-391 ointment in subjects
      who have Actinic Keratosis. This study will also access the amount of KX2-391 drug that
      enters the blood stream through dermal application of the ointment.

               -  Male Contraception: All men who are sexually active with female partners of child
                  bearing potential must agree to ensure their partners use highly effective
                  contraception and therefore will not father a child from screening to 3 months

               -  Male and Female Contraception: All men and women subjects must agree to not
                  donate sperm or eggs or attempt conception from screening to 3 months after the

             medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical
             laboratory evaluations at screening.

          6. Subject has clinically acceptable liver function at screening as demonstrated by:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)
