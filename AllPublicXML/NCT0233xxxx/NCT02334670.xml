  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that implementing plasma CrAg screening in clinics providing routine HIV
      care will enable identification of Vietnamese adult patients with advanced HIV (CD4 ≤100
      cells/μL) who have early cryptococcal disease, enable prompt preemptive treatment with
      high-dose fluconazole, and improve survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is multicenter prospective cohort evaluation of the implementation of a cryptococcal
      antigen (CrAg) screening program in Vietnam. HIV-infected patients with CD4 ≤100 cells/μL who
      present for HIV care at outpatient clinics (OPCs) in Vietnam where CrAg screening is offered
      will be recruited into the study. Study participants will be screened for cryptococcal
      antigen using the Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) and followed up for 12 months with clinical
      assessments and the collection of routine and supplemental survey data. Those who are
      CrAg-positive, but have no features of central nervous system (CNS) disease, will be treated
      with high-dose fluconazole. Those with symptoms of CNS disease will be treated according to
      national guidelines. Survival, retention in care, and other clinical outcomes will be
      documented for patients who test CrAg-positive and are treated with fluconazole and those who
      test CrAg-negative.
