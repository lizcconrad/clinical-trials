  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment guidelines indicate that oral antiviral agents for HBeAg-positive chronic
      hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) can be stopped if the patient has undergone HBeAg
      seroconversion with HBV-DNA loss measured at two consecutive occasions at least 6 months
      apart (primary treatment endpoint). Stopping treatment can be considered if undetectable
      HBV-DNA has been documented on three separate occasions 6 months apart in HBeAg-negative
      patients. However, oral antiviral drugs currently approved for the treatment of CHB have
      relatively limited sustained long-term efficacy and a large proportion of patients will
      suffer from HBV recurrence after stopping treatment.

      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the long-term efficacy of Lamivudine extending therapy in CHB patients who
           received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

        2. To evaluate the long-term outcomes and predictive factors of Lamivudine extending
           therapy in CHB patients who received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

      A prospective, open-label, multicenter study will enroll 500 treatment-naïve CHB patients who
      received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents. With their voluntary decision after
      consultation, 250 patients will receive Lamivudine extending therapy for 5 years and the
      other 250 patients will receive follow-up and serve as controls. The primary outcome
      measurement is HBV DNA recurrence, whilst the secondary outcome measurement is liver-related
      outcomes and associated predictive factors

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients &gt;=18 years of age

          2. Negative serum HBV DNA within 3 months prior to entry

          3. ALT &lt;1.5 ULN within 3 months prior to entry

          4. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of test drug.
