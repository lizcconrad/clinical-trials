  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive flexion of the trunk (relative to the legs) may be accompanied by contraction of the
      psoas muscles, even when the subject has been told not to contract any muscles. The psoas
      contraction is involuntary and cannot be controlled by the subject. This lack of passivity
      might be concomitant with lower back pain: the impairment may be present when lower back pain
      is present and/or absent when lower back pain is absent.

      The study's primary objective is thus to determine the sensitivity and/or specificity of a
      clinical test for impaired hip flexor passivity in cases of lower back pain during passive
      flexion of the trunk (from the supine position,).

      The secondary objective is to show that a negative test (after administration of correcting
      measures) is correlated with a decrease in pain (i.e. pain intensity and the functional
      repercussions of pain).

    <description>Description of the test: the subject lies in the supine position on an exercise mat with his/her feet together. The subject is told to let his/her arms rest loosely by his/her side (as if they were ropes) and to keep the head aligned with the back. The examiner pulls the subject into the sitting position by pulling on the subject's wrists, with passive flexion of the trunk until the hip joint is fully flexed..</description>
