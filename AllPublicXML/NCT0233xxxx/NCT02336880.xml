  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the feasibility and effectiveness
      of a guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy intervention in the treatment of
      cardiac anxiety and fear of body sensations in patients with non-cardiac chest pain. The
      control group will receive care-as-usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite reassurance, many patients with non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) think they have an
      undetected cardiac disease and avoid activities that they think might be harmful to their
      heart. These patients need help and support to evaluate the way they perceive and handle
      their chest pain. Therefore, we have developed a 4 session guided intervention based on
      cognitive behavioural therapy that will be delivered via internet.

      The intervention consists of psychoeducation, exposure to physical activity, and a
      breathing-based relaxation exercise. The goal with the intervention is to help the
      participants modify their beliefs about chest pain, change their cognitive and behavioural
      strategies, and give them tools to handle chest pain to prevent them from relapse.
