  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a commonly prescribed orally inhaled
      corticosteroid treatment will induce a clinically meaningful elevation in intraocular
      pressure, when administered to patients with ocular hypertension (OHT) or open-angle glaucoma
      (OAG). Based on the response to high-dose corticosteroids, this patient group is more likely
      than the normal population to demonstrate this adverse effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic and topical ophthalmic steroids have long been associated with ocular effects, such
      as glaucoma or cataracts.[1-8] Periocular steroid injections [9,10] and steroids applied to
      periocular skin [11] have also been reported to increase intraocular pressure (IOP) and
      raised IOP is the major risk factor for glaucoma.

      Ocular hypertension (OHT) is defined as an IOP above 21mmHg in one or both eyes without
      detectable glaucomatous damage. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic and
      progressive optic neuropathy of unknown etiology characterized by disc cupping, and often
      associated with visual field defects and elevated IOP. This disease is one of the leading
      causes of blindness worldwide.[12] Approximately 18% to 36% of the general population are
      corticosteroid responders. This response is increased to 46% to 92% in patients with
      POAG.[13] Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory illness in Canada, affecting
      approximately 10% of the population. For the majority of these patients, long-term inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) are standard of care to prevent acute asthma exacerbations.[14]
      Although the systemic absorption of inhaled and nasal steroids has been established, the
      clinically relevant ocular side effects are poorly defined. [15,16] A large prospective study
      in 1995 by Samiy et al reported no statistically significant increase of IOP in 187 patients
      without glaucoma taking inhaled steroids for various pulmonary conditions.[17] However, six
      cases of increased IOP associated with combined nasal and inhaled steroid use in
      non-glaucomatous patients have been reported. [18-20] A large case-control study in 1997
      suggested that current users of high doses of ICS prescribed regularly for 3 or more months
      were at increased risk of OHT or OAG (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.01-2.06).[21] In contrast, Gozalez et
      al. conducted a nested case-control study in 2010 with Quebec data which showed current and
      continuous use of ICS did not result in increased risk of glaucoma or raised IOP requiring
      treatment.[22] Similarly, Duh et al. reported no association between inhaled budesonide daily
      therapy and increased IOP in 1255 asthmatic patients.[23] Further, a prospective
      population-based cohort study published in 2012 suggested no association between the
      development of OAG and ICS in the elderly.[24] In 2013, our group published a randomized
      double-masked controlled trial that showed no evidence of IOP elevation after 6 weeks use of
      beclomethasone nasal spray in 19 patients with OHT and POAG.[25] The purpose of the current
      study protocol would be to extend the study to investigate ICS in the same patient
      population.

      To date, the effect of inhaled corticosteroids in those with pre-existing OHT or POAG remains
      uncertain. Considering the large number of patients on inhaled steroids, investigating the
      use of inhaled steroid in glaucoma patients could have significant clinical impact. This
      study was designed to evaluate the effect of inhaled fluticasone propionate on intraocular
      pressure (IOP) in patients with OHT or controlled open-angle glaucoma (OAG).

      Patient randomization was performed by an independent Research Coordinator in a separate
      physical space and kept sealed from the principal study investigators, who assessed and
      recorded outcome measures, until the completion of study data collection. IOP was measured in
      a masked fashion, using a second observer to record values. Two measurements within 1 mmHg
      were averaged for each data point. With a sample size of 8 patients per interventional arm,
      the study is powered at 0.80 to detect an elevation of 3.2 mmHg (≥20%) from mean, assuming a
      standard deviation of 2.5 mmHg. Baseline data will be compared between groups using the
      student's t test and Fisher exact test. A 2-sided p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant. The primary outcome measure (mean IOP) will be assessed using a
      1-sided Student t test.
