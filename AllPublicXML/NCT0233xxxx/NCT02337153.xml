      Codify the treatment of teeth by stiff Corticotomy technique. Evaluate the duration of
      treatment and tooth movement.

      During treatment the teeth by stiff Corticotomy, millimeter measurements are performed on a
      cohort of patients with this pathology. These measures take place during normal clinical
      phases and on all media such as, plaster models, photographs and radiological examinations
      performed at the beginning, during and at the end of treatment.
