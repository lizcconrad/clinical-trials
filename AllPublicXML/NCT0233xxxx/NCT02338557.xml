      Study was conducted Effectiveness of Motor Relearning Programme and Mirror Therapy along with
      Conventional Physiotherapy treatment for improving Hand Function In Patients with stroke.
      study was an experimental study conducted on 12 stroke patients using convenient sampling
      method .Subjects were divided into two equal groups (n=6). Group A was given conventional
      physiotherapy and Motor Relearning Programme exercises for the affected hand and Group B
      received conventional physiotherapy for the affected hand and mirror therapy for the
      unaffected hand. Chedoke arm and hand inventory (CAHAI) was used as primary outcome measure
      for evaluation of hand function before and after application of therapeutic Intervention

      Title: Effectiveness of Motor Relearning Programme and Mirror Therapy along with Conventional
      Physiotherapy treatment for improving Hand Function In Patients with stroke.

      Background Upper extremity complications are common following stroke. Individuals who have
      sustained stroke are often left with residual motor deficits of the upper limb. These
      deficits restrict functional use of the limb in everyday activities and can result in
      increased dependen cy upon others to engage in some tasks.

      Objectives Present study aims to see effectiveness of mirror therapy and Motor Relearning
      Programme for improving hand functions in stroke.

      Materials and Methods Present study was an experimental study conducted on 12 stroke patients
      using convenient sampling method .Subjects were divided into two equal groups (n=6). Group A
      was given conventional physiotherapy and Motor Relearning Programme exercises for the
      affected hand and Group B received conventional physiotherapy for the affected hand and
      mirror therapy for the unaffected hand. Chedoke arm and hand inventory (CAHAI) was used as
      primary outcome measure for evaluation of hand function before and after application of
      therapeutic Intervention

    <description>CAHAI scale is designed to encourage the bilateral hand to complete the task. Patient was made to seat in chair without arm rest and encouraging erect posture with elbows at the edge of the table and hands resting on the table. Each task was demonstrated once before performance, and then the Score was evaluated of the affected upper extremity using the 7 point activity scale from total assistance (1) to complete independence.</description>

    <description>Group B received Mirror therapy in which patient was seated close to the table in front of mirror (35x35 cm). The involved hand was placed behind the mirror. : the practice consisted of intransitive exercises as Hand opening, Wrist extension and flexion, Forearm pronation and supination, Hand sliding on a flat surface. During the session patient were asked to try to do the same movement with the paretic hand while they were moving the non-paretic hand.In both the groups total treatment was given for 1 hour/day for 6 days/week</description>
