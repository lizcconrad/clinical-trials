    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc, also known as scleroderma) is a disease characterized by fibrosis of
      the skin and organs, inflammation, and an abnormal endothelial cell lining inside of vessels.
      A common and deadly complication of SSc is pulmonary hypertension (PH), which is an abnormal
      elevation in the blood pressure within the lung blood vessels. Early identification and
      treatment of PH is important in SSc, and no clinical factors can predict which patients will
      develop PH with acceptable accuracy. A potential marker of PH in SSc is the presence of
      increased amounts of endothelial microparticles (EMPs), which are substances circulating in
      the blood that were released from damaged vessel wall endothelial lining. A main goal of this
      study is to investigate if there is a difference in EMP levels between SSc patients with and
      without PH. The investigators will also use human endothelial cells in a lab environment to
      test whether these EMPs isolated from SSc patients are actually causing damage to the vessel
      lining. Lastly, the investigators will investigate the potential benefit of a medication used
      after transplant, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). This will be done by causing damage to
      isolated human endothelial cells and treating them with MMF. The main goal of this portion of
      our study is to see if EMP levels are reduced when cells are treated with MMF. Overall, the
      investigators anticipate the following outcomes of this study: 1) use EMP levels to
      differentiation patients with SSc who have PH from those without PH, 2) use EMPs to
      understand how endothelial damage occurs in SSc, and 3) use EMPs to help us develop new
      treatments for patients with vascular diseases.
