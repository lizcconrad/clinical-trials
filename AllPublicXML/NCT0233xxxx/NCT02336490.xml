    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot study proposes to field-test key logistical aspects of studying an
      intervention already available to patients on the pediatric ward, namely a discharge
      medication delivery service, called &quot;Meds-in-Hand,&quot; which has been refined via a quality
      improvement process, but not rigorously studied nor fully implemented.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At this time, Meds-in-Hand is not currently utilized for approximately 40% of patients
      admitted to the pediatric ward at Boston Medical Center. Currently patients do not receive
      their discharge medications via the delivery service for a variety of reasons, however they
      continue to receive the usual care standard employed by most hospitals, where prescriptions
      are sent to their home pharmacy for pickup after discharge. This study does not change the
      actual medications patients receive, but how and when they get them. Rigorous study of the
      relationship between Meds-in-Hand and patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes has not been
      performed to date, so there is equipoise about the value of the intervention, however
      observational data in the population in question, namely children admitted for an asthma
      exacerbation, suggest that patients who receive Meds-in-Hand prior to discharge have a
      reduced likelihood of a return visit to the Emergency Department in 30 days. The study will
      focus on parent-patient dyads admitted with an asthma exacerbation where the child is aged
      2-17 years, however parents will be the exclusive study subjects. Parents of the patients
      will be asked a baseline, in-hospital survey as well as participate in phone follow-up
      interviews to report on the patient experience and parent-reported child health outcomes at
      approximately 3 and 30 days after leaving the hospital. 60 total parents will be enrolled, 30
      in each arm of the study. This pilot study will also obtain empiric estimates of key study
      parameters to inform future study design and begin to examine trends between the groups of
      patients who are randomized to the Meds-in-Hand intervention and those randomized to usual
      care.
