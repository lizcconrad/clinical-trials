      SF1126 is a novel inhibitor of PI3 kinase and mTOR that includes an active moiety (consisting
      of LY294002) linked to an RGDS tetrapeptide that targets the active agent to integrin
      expressing tissues. In this first pediatric phase 1 trial of SF1126, dose escalation will
      follow a 3+3 dose escalation design. Once a recommended phase 2 pediatric dose is identified,
      an expansion cohort of 10 patients with tumors with MYCN amplification, Mycn expression, or
      Myc expression will be treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway have demonstrated preclinical activity in neuroblastoma.
      This activity may derive in part from destabilizing Mycn protein, impeding tumor
      angiogenesis, and/or other effects. SF1126 is a novel inhibitor of PI3 kinase and mTOR that
      includes an active moiety (consisting of LY294002) linked to an RGDS tetrapeptide that
      targets the active agent to integrin expressing tissues. In preclinical studies, SF1126
      results in marked concentration of LY294002 into tumors. In an adult phase 1 trial, a maximum
      tolerated dose of SF1126 was not identified up to doses of 1110 mg/m2 administered
      intravenously twice weekly on a continuous schedule. In this first pediatric phase 1 trial of
      SF1126, dose escalation will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design. Once a recommended phase 2
      pediatric dose is identified, an expansion cohort of 10 patients with tumors with MYCN
      amplification, Mycn expression, or Myc expression will be treated. All patients will
      participate in mandatory pharmacokinetic testing. Additional optional correlative studies
      will evaluate potential predictive markers and potential pharmacodynamic markers, including
      PTEN and PIK3CA aberrations, Myc / Mycn expression, and Myc / pS6 levels in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of
             neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased
             urinary catecholamines.

          -  Patients must have high-risk neuroblastoma according to COG risk classification at the
             time of study enrollment.

          -  Patients must have at least ONE of the following: 1) Recurrent/progressive disease at
             any time prior to study enrollment, 2) Refractory disease, 3) Persistent disease

          -  Patients must have at least ONE of the following: 1) Bone disease, 2) Any amount of
             neuroblastoma tumor cells in the bone marrow, 3) At least one soft tissue lesion that
             meets criteria for a TARGET lesion.

          -  Patients must have a Lansky (&lt; 16 years) or Karnofsky (&gt; 16 years) score of at least
             50

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

             time of study entry or while on study.

          -  Patients must not be receiving other investigational medications (covered under
             another IND) within 30 days of study entry or while on study.

          -  Patients must not be receiving chronic systemic corticosteroids at doses greater than
             physiologic dosing (inhaled corticosteroids acceptable).
