      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-pivotal, single arm, non-significant risk evaluation
      the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System - Pro across different stages of T2
      diabetes management. This is a non-significant risk study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will wear two Sensors, one applied to the back of each upper arm, for a period of 14
      days. Subjects will wear the Sensor while going about their normal daily activities during
      the home use period. Subjects will not be able to see any glucose data. The devices will be
      removed at the completion of the final study visit.

      Data obtained from the Reader and reports generated by the system will not be used by the
      subject or the research team members to determine treatment. Subjects must adhere to their
      diabetes clinical management plan established prior to the study.

      No additional medical care will be provided to study subjects following study completion
      other than care related to the follow up and treatment of adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subject must have diagnosis of type 2 diabetes prior to enrollment.

          3. Subject must have been on current treatment regimen for at least 6 months prior to
             enrollment and must remain on therapy regimen for the duration of the study (subjects
             diagnosed within last 6 months must be on no medication both prior to and throughout
             the study to enroll).

          4. HbA1c greater than or equal to 6.0% or less than or equal to 12.0% as demonstrated by
             lab HbA1c result obtained within the last 6 months.

               1. Subjects with HbA1c &lt;7.5% will be excluded from the study if the subject's
                  intended therapy group for enrollment requires an HbA1c ≥7.5%.

               2. For therapy groups enrolling 12 subjects with HbA1c of &lt;7.5% and 12 subjects with
                  HbA1c of ≥7.5%, subjects with an HbA1c level within each respective range will be
                  excluded from the study once the enrollment goal of that HbA1c range has been
                  met.

               3. If no HbA1c taken within the last six months is available, a new laboratory HbA1c
                  value must be obtained prior to Sensor application.

          5. Subject must be able to read and understand English.

          6. In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol

          7. In the investigators opinion, the subject must be compliant with their diabetes
             management plan and must be able to adhere to medication regimen throughout study.

          8. Subject must be available to participate in all study visits.

          9. Subject must be willing and able to provide written signed and dated informed consent.
