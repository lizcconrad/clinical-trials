    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with nasopharyngeal
      cancer that has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent) and/or has spread to other
      parts of the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block tumor
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective tumor response to nivolumab in patients with previously treated recurrent and/or
      metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Tumor response to nivolumab based on immune-related response criteria (IRC). II. Duration
      of response. III. Progression-free survival and overall survival. IV. Safety and
      tolerability.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effect of nivolumab on tumor burden by analyzing the clearance of
      plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during the first 4-6 weeks of
      treatment.

      II. To investigate the association between treatment outcome and immunological markers: a)
      Intratumoral expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand
      (PD-L1) in archived NPC tissues (mandatory); b) Serum absolute lymphocyte count at baseline
      and post-treatment (mandatory); and c) Plasma cytokine levels at baseline and serially during
      the first 8 weeks of treatment; d) Expression of PD-1 in cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T
      cells in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) at baseline (optional).

      III. To investigate functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences as an early
      predictor of response to nivolumab (optional only at Chinese University of Hong Kong [CUHK]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes on days 1 and 15.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
