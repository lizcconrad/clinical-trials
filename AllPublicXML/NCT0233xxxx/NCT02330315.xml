  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (TUS) on pain perception and
      functional limitations in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when
      compared to sham stimulation.

    <measure>Changes in Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain will be measured in order to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (applied in a diagnostic mode) is effective in reducing pain in subjects with osteoarthritis knee pain.

    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will be asked to stand unsupported with the feet parallel to each other and a block 5 cm directly in front of them. Subject will then be advised which leg is the stepping leg and asked to place the whole foot onto the block, then return it fully down to the floor. This procedure will be repeated as fast as possible.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Trained study staff will perform standard neurological examinations at several points throughout the study to ensure subject safety.
