  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      APN1125 when administered as single doses to healthy adult subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 parts: (1) a single dose in healthy adult volunteers, (2) effect
      of food upon pharmacokinetics of a single dose of APN1125 in healthy adult volunteers.
