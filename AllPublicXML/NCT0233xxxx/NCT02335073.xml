    <textblock>
      Liver biopsy is the reference method for the measurement of liver fibrosis. But it has many
      limitations, such as sampling error and individual variation in interpreting the results.
      Currently, serum liver fibrosis markers have been employed as non-invasive diagnosis of liver
      fibrosis and evaluation of the severity of liver fibrosis. They include laminin (LN),
      hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen type IV (CIV), and N-terminal propeptide of collagen III
      (PIIINP). However, few study was conducted to explore the role of these liver fibrosis
      markers in evaluating the prognosis of liver cirrhosis. Our hypothesis is that LN, HA, CIV,
      and PIIINP in combination or alone can predict the prognosis of liver cirrhosis.
