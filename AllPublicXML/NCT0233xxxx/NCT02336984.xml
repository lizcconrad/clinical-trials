      The purpose of the study is to treat patients with Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a
      combined treatment of DC1 vaccine with Trastuzumab. In this study the investigators will
      assess the safety and immunogenicity of the combination therapy. The target population is
      women over 18 years of age and have a diagnosis of DCIS that express HER-2 3 positive.
      Participants will receive 6 vaccines along with 2 doses of trastuzumab.

      This study began at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and will
      continue at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute.
