    <textblock>
      Patients who are scheduled for: elective oesophageal tumour resection, total gastrectomy,
      pancreas resection, major vascular, total cystectomy will be recruited.To investigate effects
      of central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous saturation (ScvO2) guided fluid
      management on intraoperative haemodynamic parameters, volume and vasopressor requirement, and
      postoperative organ function and postoperative inflammatory response.

    <description>In the control group if the mean arterial pressure fall below 60 mm Hg and the central venous pressure (CVP) is low fluid bolus is administered if the central venous pressure is in normal range vasopressor is given.</description>

    <description>In the ScvO2 group patients receive interventions in two options: if the ScvO2 fall below 75% or more than 3% or if the mean arterial pressure fall below 60 mm Hg. In the former case the mean arterial pressure in the latter the ScvO2 values determined if tha patient received fluid or vasopressor or both.</description>

    <description>Central venous saturation was continuously monitored by using a CeVOX monitor (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). The CeVOX probe (PV2022-37; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) was inserted into the internal jugular central venous catheter as described in the user's manual.</description>
