  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mid-life women, aged 35-50, are currently an underserved population in the areas of
      unintended pregnancy and STI prevention interventions. Common perception is that women in
      this age range are no longer sexually active, or are past the menopause transition, but in
      reality, sexual activity remains stable through mid-life and into the post-menopausal years.
      Additionally, physiological and relationship status changes (e.g. divorce or death of a
      partner) put these women at increased risk for both unintended pregnancy and STI's. This
      project developed and evaluated a theoretically-based multimedia intervention designed to
      assist mid-life women in protecting themselves from sexually transmitted infections and
      unintended pregnancy.

      The primary aim of this project was to create and evaluate a theoretically-based, interactive
      multimedia program for women aged 35-55 to assist them in avoiding unintended pregnancy and
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The intervention, titled &quot;Women's Reproductive
      Health: A guide to staying healthy,&quot; addressed these concerns across the life span and was
      designed to increase knowledge about (a) pregnancy risk; (b) STI risk; (c) strategies to
      prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy; (d) influences of sexual partners on risk reduction
      decisions and behaviors; (e) partner communication techniques; and (f) health care provider
      communication techniques.Overall features of the program include video, interactive tools,
      animations, text information pages, and various links both across and within specific modules
      to link related information. A feature titled &quot;My Notes&quot; allowed the user to save content
      from the program into an easily retrievable repository.

      Motivational videos featuring friendly mid-life hosts could be viewed on the first page of
      each module, as well as on the home page and topic introduction pages. These videos not only
      provided specific information about the content, they also provided message framing and set
      the tone of the program segment. Other videos included testimonials on topics such as
      contraceptive methods, sexually transmitted infections, and other health information.
      Interactive materials include an assessment checklist for STI risk, a quiz to help the user
      identify the types of birth control methods that best fit her lifestyle and preferences, as
      well as several checklists

    <description>A 22-item knowledge scale was created to assess content areas of the program (e.g., 3 items on anatomy &amp; physiology, 16 items on pregnancy prevention, and 4 items on STI prevention). For example, users were asked to answer the question &quot;A women is most likely to become pregnant (no matter how long or short her menstrual cycle) if she has sexual intercourse about:&quot; with choices being (a) 1 week before menstruation beings, (b) 2 weeks after menstruation begins, (c) 2 weeks before menstruation begins, (d) 1 week after menstruation begins, or (e) do not know.</description>

    <measure>Attitudes about reproductive health and prevention</measure>
    <time_frame>7-day posttest and 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participant attitudes were measured using scales that assessed the perceived importance of using a contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy (6 items), the perceived importance of talking with your partner about contraception (4 items) and two additional items measuring the perceived importance of using a contraceptive method to prevent STIs (1 item), and the perceived importance of talking with your healthcare provider (1 item) (alpha =.74, test- retest reliability=.73).</description>

    <description>Participant self-efficacy was measured using scales that assessed confidence in preventing pregnancy (6 items), and talking with the partner (2 items) (alpha=84, test-retest reliability=.68).</description>
