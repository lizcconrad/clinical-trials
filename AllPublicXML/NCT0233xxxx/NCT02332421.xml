  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, two distractors will be used to retract maxillary canines into the extraction
      sites. The first distractor is a modified Hyrax expander with two arms soldered to two bands
      connected to a canine and a molar; and the second one is a similar to the first one but with
      the addition of a third arm.

      The purpose of this investigation is to compare the two distractors in terms of: final
      position of the canine, canine pulp vitality, molars' anchorage, patient's acceptance to the
      appliance.

  <detailed_description>

      The retraction of the canines is one of the longest and most important stages in the
      orthodontic treatment of cases that require premolars extraction. The retraction phase of the
      canines into an extraction site with conventional treatment method usually lasts about 4 to 6
      months under normal circumstances. The use of dentoalveolar distraction (DAD) technique has
      been considered a very important step in this field. It has been shown by early case reports
      that this technique can be employed to retract canines within 10 to 14 days.

      Although DAD is thought to accelerate tooth movement during canine retraction, a significant
      amount of tipping (distal tilting) was observed in many case reports. So in this study, there
      is an intention to apply a modified DAD device on one side of the mouth and to compare it
      with the conventional one applied on the opposite side of the mouth in each participating
      patient.
