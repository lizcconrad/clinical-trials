    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that the osteoarthritis care for persons with hip or knee
      osteoarthritis in Norway has a potential for improvement as the provided care may not
      necessarily reflect evidence-based guideline recommendations. This study will determine if a
      new model for integrated osteoarthritis (OA) care in primary health care will result in
      improved quality of osteoarthritis care and health benefits for the patients (reduced pain
      and body weight, increased function and activity level) among patients with hip and/or knee
      osteoarthritis. Further, this study will examine if the new model reduce the number of
      unnecessary referrals to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to orthopaedic surgeons in
      secondary care, and if it increases the number of referrals to physiotherapy treatment and
      the number of discharge reports from the physiotherapists to the referring general
      practitioner.

      A new model for integrated care for patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA) in
      primary care will be developed and implemented. The purpose of the model is to improve
      quality of OA care in primary health care services by increasing the collaboration between
      health care professionals and across health care levels, providing an integrated care and a
      patient pathway, and facilitating an active and healthy lifestyle among individuals with OA.
      This implementation study represents a collaborative study between six municipalities and a
      hospital department aiming to fulfill the intentions of the Norwegian Health Care
      Coordination Reform. The main aim of the present study is to implement and perform process
      and effect evaluations of this new model for integrated OA care. The study design will be a
      cluster randomized controlled trial with a stepped wedge design. Six neighboring
      municipalities will constitute the six clusters, which will switch from control (current OA
      care) to intervention phase (new OA model) in a randomized order. All municipalities start
      the trial simultaneously and act as controls until the point in time they are randomized to
      crossover from control to intervention, and all municipalities have implemented the
      intervention by the end of inclusion. The method consists of two parts; 1) Identification of
      barriers/facilitators + development of the model and interventions, 2) Implementation of the
      new model (interactive workshops) with process and effect evaluations. Participants will be
      general practitioners and physiotherapists in primary care as well as people with hip or knee
      OA.
