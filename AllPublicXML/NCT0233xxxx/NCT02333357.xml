    <textblock>
      This study is developing and testing a 12-step toolkit with five modules, training counselors
      to use them, and studying their frequency of use, desirability, effectiveness and patient
      outcomes. The toolkit includes counselor written guides, posters, client worksheets,
      engagement activities, and videos designed to be shown during substance abuse treatment group
      sessions to explain and encourage 12-step participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has three aims. Aim 1 involves the development of an evidence-based 12-step
      facilitation toolkit curriculum. Toolkit structure and content is grounded in theory and
      empirical findings, and incorporates feedback from 12-step facilitation experts and
      individuals with a history of substance abuse. Aim 2 consists of implementing the resulting
      five-module Toolkit in a multi-site randomized controlled trial using a pre-/post-Toolkit
      training design that includes 1- and 6-month post-training assessments. Group counselors
      employed at community-based outpatient and inpatient substance abuse treatment programs will
      be randomly assigned to a Toolkit or treatment-as-usual condition. Data obtained from
      audiotaped sessions will identify between group differences in counselor adherence to 12-step
      content and skillfulness. Additional data will be collected on counselor satisfaction,
      12-step attitudes and beliefs, and 12-step knowledge, as well as on Toolkit acceptability,
      feasibility, and short-term sustainability. Aim 3 will determine whether exposure to the
      Toolkit curriculum results in stable 12-step involvement and decreased self-reported
      substance use among clients.

    <description>Counselors randomized to the toolkit (TK) condition will receive a one to three hour standardized toolkit orientation that will include a description of the overall goal of the toolkit curriculum comprised of five modules, the purpose of each individual element of the toolkit, and an introduction to the toolkit teaching aids such as counselor guides, posters, and patient materials (hand-outs, sampling menus, worksheets, etc). TK counselor participants then conduct group treatment sessions using the toolkit materials with their patient participants.</description>
