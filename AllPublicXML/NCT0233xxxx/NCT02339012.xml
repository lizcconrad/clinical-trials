      Background:

      - Biomarkers are substances in people s blood and tissues. They help researchers understand
      diseases and signs of aging. Scientists want to do more research on biomarkers to find ways
      to improve quality of life in old age.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about biomarkers and their relationship to aging.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 20 years old who weigh at least 110 pounds and have a body mass index below
      30. They must agree that their genetic samples can be collected, studied, and stored.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
           tests. They will have heart tests and nurse will assess their veins. They will fill out
           a questionnaire.

        -  Participants will have a 2-day baseline visit. Then they will return every 2 years for
           up to 10 years. These follow-up visits will repeat the baseline visit:

        -  Repeat of screening procedures.

        -  Physical performance tests like balance and walking tests.

        -  Leg and grip strength tests.

        -  Health and mental state questions.

        -  Memory and problem solving tests.

        -  Cytapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in the vein of one arm and run
           through a machine. The blood will be returned through a needle in a vein of the other
           arm.

        -  Visits may also include:

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging scans. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and
           out of a machine that takes pictures.

        -  Diabetes test. After fasting, participants will drink a sweet drink and give blood.

        -  Breathing and walking tests.

        -  Wearing a device that record physical activity.

        -  Scan of the abdomen and the right leg.

        -  A small amount of muscle tissue and/or skin removed.

    <textblock>
      Under the assumption that aging is caused by dysfunction of specific biological mechanisms,
      it is reasonable to hypothesize that slowing aging should delay the onset of chronic diseases
      that typically affect older persons and improve their longevity and quality of life. Indeed,
      there is emerging evidence that factors associated with premature mortality are also involved
      in multiple pathologic conditions typical of aging. Scientists have suggested that these
      factors are genetic in nature and involve variations in the genetic code sequence. Contrary
      to this view, genetic approaches to study of aging have had limited success and it has been
      argued that the study of aging and longevity requires a more comprehensive analysis that
      includes non-genetic biomarkers such as epigenetic, gene expression and protein biomarkers.
      This is because these non-genetic biomarkers reflect the interaction between genetic
      variation and environmental/behavioral factors. A major limitation in this approach to date
      is that most studies of epigenetic, gene expression and protein biomarkers rely on blood
      specimens, which may not recapitulate the biology of other tissues. In addition, although all
      cell types from the same person have exactly the same genetic code; information on epigenetic
      modifications, RNAm, and protein expression likely differ across cell types and at different
      points in time. Thus, global measures of these biomarkers in specific cell types can be
      affected by percentages of these cell types in the blood, and it is well know that such
      percentages change with aging and chronic diseases.

      To overcome the limitations described above, we plan to use cytapheresis to collect large
      number of PBMCs in a group of healthy individuals dispersed over a wide age-range. The
      collection of large number of PBMCs is essential to obtain a sufficient number of cells for
      each cell type to support measurements of the biomarkers of interest. The information
      collected will be used to identify biomarkers that change with aging in individuals who are
      initially healthy, independent of changes in specific PBMCs cell types. We will also develop
      a statistical model that can be used by other studies of biomarkers to adjust their analysis
      for PBMCs cell type composition without having to perform complex and expensive measures,
      such as flow cytometry. The data collected in PBMCs will be compared to similar biomarker
      data obtained from muscle and skin biopsies to understand to what extent biomarkers measured
      in the blood recapitulate similar changes that occur in different human tissues. Finally,
      once methodological limitations of measuring biomarkers in the blood have been addressed, we
      plan to assess the relationship of biomarkers assessed in specific circulating cell types, in
      the whole blood and in muscle and skin biopsies to physiological measures that typically
      change with aging, including measures of body composition (anthropometrics, CT scan and MRI),
      energetics (spirometry at rest and during different degrees of exercise intensity),
      homeostatic equilibrium (hormones and inflammatory markers), neurological function
      (neurocognitive testing, brain MRI, nerve conduction studies). At the first follow-up, Year 2
      (and every four years after it) we will focus on in depth characterization of phenotypes that
      are relevant for aging. This strategy reduces the burden to participants but still allows
      delineating trajectories of essential variables and relate them longitudinally.The final goal
      is to develop new hypotheses about the biological nature of the aging process and how aging
      is associated with decline of physical and cognitive function.

      <textblock>
        -  Since the study of gene expression and epigenetic regulation are essential aims of
             GESTALT, all participants are required to consent to DNA/RNA testing and storage at
             the Screening Visit and all subsequent Follow-up Visits. Participants that refuse
             genetic testing and storage will not be eligible to participate or to continue to

        The criteria below pertain only to the Screening and Baseline Visits, except where
        otherwise noted. If any of the conditions develop while the participant is in the study,
        the participant remains in the study. In particular, participants who develop cognitive and
        motor problems from medical conditions such as stroke or Parkinson s disease are retained
        in the study, although they are excluded from specific testing in which their underlying
        health condition is an exclusion criterion. Participants that develop more severe cognitive
        problems and are diagnosed with dementia, will no longer be able to participate in the
        study.

        Participant Exclusion Criteria

        These criteria pertain to the Screening and Baseline Visits. If conditions considered as
        exclusion criteria for study entry develop any time after the baseline evaluation, the
        participant remains in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV virus infection.

          -  Hepatitis B or C.

          -  Active syphilis, gonorrhea or TB requiring treatment.

          -  WBC &lt;3,000 or &gt; 12,000/mcrL.

          -  Platelets &lt; 100,000 or &gt;600,000 /mcrL.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dL in women and &lt; 12.0 in men.

          -  Creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dl or calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 50 cc/min.

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dl (unless higher levels can be ascribed to Gilbert s disease.

          -  ALT, AST or alkaline phosphatase twice the normal serum concentration.

          -  Corrected calcium &lt; 8.5 or &gt; 10.7 mg/dl.

          -  Albumin &lt; 3.1 g/dl.

          -  Positive Urine Drug Screen (unless taking prescribed medication and at the discretion
             of the PI).

        Furthermore, if the participant is found eligible at screening and baseline but fails a
        urine drug screen (unless taking prescribed medication and at the discretion of the PI). at
        any of the subsequent (follow-up) visits, the participant will be asked to return in about
        30 days to repeat the test and if positive, will no longer be eligible to participate in
        the study.

        If female and found to be pregnant during pregnancy screening at any visit, the participant
        will need to reschedule their visit for when they are 3 months postpartum and/or post
        breastfeeding.

        Justification for Exclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)

        Exclusion of Women: Not Applicable

          -  Pregnancy: Women of child bearing age who become pregnant during the study will be
             deferred from a study visit until they are no longer pregnant and breastfeeding (3
             months post pregnancy and/or breastfeeding).

          -  Exclusion of Children: Participants under the age of 20 years old will not be allowed
             to participate in GESTALT because GESTALT is a study on the aging of adults and does
             not include the developmental growth period of children.

          -  Exclusion of Non-English Speaking Subjects: Due to the complexity of testing/
             procedures and extensive cognitive testing protocols, consents, instructions and
             questionnaires are provided in English. Therefore, all participants must be able to
             able to read and speak English. To date, the NIA located in Baltimore has not had
             non-English speaking participants interested in participating in studies. In regards
             to this study, should this occur in the future, the Principal Investigator, in
             conjunction with the requirements of SOP 12 Requirements of Informed Consent, and more
             specifically 12.9.1 Non-English Speaking Subjects will be used to determine if changes
             related to recruitment and enrollment of non-English speaking participants is needed.
