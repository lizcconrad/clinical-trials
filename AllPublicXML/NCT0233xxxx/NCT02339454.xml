  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal and pilot clinical studies to induce
      local growth of new blood vessels. Small single-center clinical trials with shockwave therapy
      showed promising results in reducing angina symptoms, improving perfusion and contractility
      in patients with refractory angina and stress-induced ischemia on imaging test.

      The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve angina symptoms and
      exercise tolerance in broader population of patients with stable angina regardless of imaging
      test results Study aims to demonstrate anti-anginal efficacy of Extracorporeal Shockwave
      Myocardial Revascularization Therapy (ESMR), on top of stable optimal medical treatment in
      patients with stable angina.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves (0.09 millijoule/mm2) are delivered to myocardial tissue. Shockwaves
      are created by a special generator and are focused using a shockwave applicator device. The
      treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment. The shockwaves are delivered in
      synchronization with Patient R-wave (ECG) to avoid arrhythmias. The treatment is painless.

      At first, the patient undergoes modified Bruce treadmill test, to assess exercise induced
      ischemia.

      Exercise induced ECG ischemia is defined as the new development of horizontal or down -
      sloping ST segment depression (≥1 mm at 60 ms after J point) versus baseline tracing.

      Study treatment consists of 9 sessions, with 3 sessions per week 1, 5 and 9. 100 shocks are
      delivered per spot, 1200 shocks per session.

      During 1st treatment week ESMR will be delivered 3 times (every other day) to basal segments
      (2 spots in each wall in apical 4-, 2-, 3- chamber positions).

      During 2nd treatment week ESMR will be delivered 3 times (every other day) to middle segments
      (2 spots in each wall in apical 4-, 2-, 3- chamber positions).

      During 3rd treatment week ESMR will be delivered 3 times (every other day) to apical segments
      (2 spots in each wall in apical 4-, 2-, 3- chamber positions).

      The spots are localized by the ultra-sound device and the shockwaves are focused to this
      area. Several treatments are required for optimal results.
