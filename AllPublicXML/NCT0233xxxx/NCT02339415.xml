      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of pharmacologic FXa inhibition (via
      edoxaban 30 mg daily) on inflammation, as reflected in plasma Interleukin-6 levels.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that increased generation of activated factor X (FXa) contributes to a
      systemic elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g. IL-6) among HIV positive
      patients. This occurs, in part, via FXa activation of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2)
      on monocytes and tissue macrophages, which perpetuates innate inflammation. We will test our
      hypothesis with an oral antagonist to FXa (edoxaban), and quantify the immunologic effects of
      PAR-2 inhibition on systemic inflammation and monocyte activation.

      The potential benefits of pharmacologic inhibition of FXa will be studied among HIV positive
      participants receiving ART with suppressed HIV viral load and a D-dimer &gt;100 ng/mL. The study
      design is a cross-over placebo controlled randomized trial of edoxaban 30mg daily versus
      matched placebo (n=40 total participants). After screening and baseline visits, participants
      will be randomized to the sequence of drug administration (i.e., edoxaban vs. placebo). After
      randomization, participants will start study medication #1 and follow-up for visits at months
      1, 2, 3 and 4. They will then stop study medication for 3 months, return for visits at months
      7 and 8 (analogous to screening and baseline, respectively), then start study medication #2
      and follow-up for visits at months 9, 10, 11, and 12.

      The treatment effect (i.e., changes from pre-treatment levels) over 4 months will be assessed
      in measures of inflammation, immune activation, and coagulation. For comparisons with
      placebo, each participant will then serve as his or her own control in this cross-over
      design.
