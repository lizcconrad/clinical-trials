    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies if kilo-voltage cone beam computed tomography (KV-CBCT) and
      ultrasound imaging works in guiding radiation therapy in patients with prostate, liver, or
      pancreatic cancer. Computer systems, such as KV-CBCT and ultrasound imaging, allow doctors to
      create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor may help in planning radiation therapy and may
      result in more tumor cells being killed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the feasibility of combining on-board cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
      with ultrasound imaging to overcome the shortcomings of CBCT or ultrasound imaging alone for
      imaging guided radiotherapy delivery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultrasound imaging prior to and during radiation therapy. Patients also
      undergo kilo-voltage cone beam computed tomography prior to radiation therapy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have either 1) cancer involving the liver by biopsy or radiographic
             criteria, or 2) prostate cancer by biopsy, with the intent of undergoing definitive
             dose radiation therapy to targets within the liver, or prostate. Patients with
             prostatectomy receiving post-operative radiotherapy are also eligible.

          -  Karnofsky performance status (PS) â‰¥ 70

          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informational form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled inter-current illness or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
