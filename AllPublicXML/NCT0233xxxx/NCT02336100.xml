  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients without obvious mucosal break by endoscopy
      were examined by FICE, followed by confocal. Validity scores for MERD diagnosis were
      analyzed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-six patients with suspected MERD (positive GerdQ but normal conventional endoscopy)
      and eighteen asymptomatic control were recruited. The new FICE (EPX-4450HD) was performed at
      non-magnified, x50, and x100 zoom levels. The criteria for positive FICE were; A) triangular
      indentation, B) punctuate erythema, C) villiform mucosa, or D) increased number of capillary
      vessel. At the same session, pCLE was applied to count the number of intrapapillary capillary
      loops (IPCLs) by using more than 5 IPCLs in 500x500 micron area as a criterion for MERD
      diagnosis. The validity scores of both modalities and interobserever agreement of pCLE
      interpretation was assessed.
