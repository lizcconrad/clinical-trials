  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a renal injury and progressive and irreversible loss of kidney
      function and in its most advanced stage is called chronic renal failure.

      Although hemodialysis replace some kidney function, patients suffer some alterations
      characterized by &quot;uremic syndrome&quot; typically expressed by: motor neuropathy and/or autonomic
      neuropathy, cardiac or musculoskeletal myopathies, peripheral vascular changes, among others.
      Thereby, the the adoption of physical exercise should be encouraged. However, it is known
      that the ability to exercise the subject in hemodialysis is low and keeping in mind the
      weakness of the muscular system in these individuals, the aim of this study is to assess the
      effects of functional electrical stimulation (FES) on muscle architecture of patients with
      chronic kidney disease hemodialysis.

      For this the following assessments will be performed before and after stimulation:
      ultrasonography to assess muscle architecture; six-minute walk test to functional capacity;
      Kidney Disease and Quality of Life - Short Form questionnaire for quality of life; sit and
      stand test for resistance of the lower limbs; dynamometric by load cell for muscle strength
      of the lower limbs; flow-mediated dilatation to endothelial function; blood collection for
      analysis of inflammatory markers and DNA damage.

      The subjects will be randomized into two groups, FESG (functional electrical stimulation
      group) and CG (control group). The first will receive the FES in the quadriceps muscle of
      both thighs, for eight weeks, three times a week during hemodialysis session. While the
      control group only will be evaluated and re-evaluated.

      Expected results at the end of the protocol with FES are: increased quadriceps muscle
      thickness; longest distance covered on the six-minute walk test; improved quality of life;
      increase in resistance of the lower limbs; increased muscle strength of the lower limbs;
      improved endothelial function; improved inflammatory status and DNA damage.

      The research will be developed in the hemodialysis unit of the Santa Clara hospital of Santa
      Casa de Misericordia de Porto Alegre.

      After the selection of patients for eligibility criteria they will be randomized into
      functional electrical stimulation group or control group. First all patients will be
      evaluated, and subsequently the patients in the functional electrical stimulation group will
      be trained three times per week for eight weeks using an electric current called functional
      electrical stimulation through the stimulator device NEURODYN II, IBRAMED mark, Amparo, Sao
      Paulo, Brazil.

      The sessions took place in the first hour of dialysis and will last at least 20 and maximum
      of 34 minutes. The parameters selected in the stimulator will be: 80 Hz frequency, 0.4 ms
      pulse, 10 s time on, 50-20s time off, intensity as patient tolerance. The patient will be
      positioned supine, the knees will be at 60° flexion through a foam wedge and ankles
      restrained by a band to make isometric exercise.

      Furthermore, the electrodes used to perform the electrical stimulation will adhesive,
      disposable and hypoallergenic. These will be placed over the motor points of the quadriceps
      muscle of both legs in order to make the most effective contraction.

      At the end of follow-up, both groups will be further evaluated in order to compare.

    <description>Functional electrical stimulation will be applied through self adhesive electrodes on the quadriceps muscle of both thighs, and these will be positioned at 60° of flexion and contained by a band for that exercise happen isometric form.
Parameter settings in the electrical stimulator are as follows: 80 Hz frequency, 0.4 ms pulse, 10 s time on, 50-20 s time off, intensity according to the patient's tolerance but enough to cause visible muscle contraction. The total time of each session starts at twenty minutes and is increased every week a total thirty-four minutes at the end of the eighth week. Intervention will be held three times a week for eight weeks and during hemodialysis session.</description>
