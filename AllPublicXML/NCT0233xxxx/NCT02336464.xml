  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although pain has been extensively studied in ICU patients, only a few studies have focused
      on dyspnea, which is experienced by 50% of mechanically ventilated patients. The purpose of
      the present study is to determine whether dyspnea in intensive care unit patients is
      associated with a higher length of stay in the ICU and a higher incidence of post traumatic
      stress disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are continuously exposed to various unpleasant sensations
      that are as many sources of discomfort. If, growing attention has been given to the detection
      and treatment of pain, very little attention has been given to dyspnea. However, there is
      growing evidence suggesting that dyspnea is frequent and severe in mechanically ventilated
      ICU patients. In mechanically ventilated ICU patients, dyspnea is independently associated
      with anxiety and mechanical ventilation itself. Indeed, an optimization of ventilator
      settings alleviates dyspnea in 35% of patients.

      Various arguments suggest that dyspnea contributes to the dark experience of ICU and
      participates to the genesis of post traumatic stress disorders. In addition, dyspnea is
      associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation.

      Large multicentre studies are however lacking. The aims of the present multicentre study are
      1) to quantify the prevalence of dyspnea in a large population of ICU mechanically ventilated
      patients, 2) to examine the link between the level of dyspnea and the occurrence of adverse
      events in the ICU, 3) to determine whether dyspnea in intensive care unit patients is
      associated with a higher length of stay in the ICU and a higher incidence of post traumatic
      stress disorder associated symptoms.
