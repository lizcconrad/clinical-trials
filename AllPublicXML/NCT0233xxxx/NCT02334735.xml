  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccine adjuvants are compounds used to increase specific immune responses to antigens, but
      have minimal toxicity or lasting immune effects on their own. This study investigates the use
      of dendritic cells as an adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A/MART-1 peptides compared to
      Montanide® in study subjects with melanoma in complete clinical remission.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open label, randomized two-arm study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and immunogenicity of Poly-ICLC matured DCs as an adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A/MART-1
      peptides (ARM A; DC Vaccine) compared to Montanide® ISA-51 VG (ARM B; Montanide Vaccine),
      both with systemic administration of Poly-ICLC on days 1 and 2 in study subjects with
      melanoma in complete clinical remission but at high-risk for disease recurrence.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent

          -  Histologic diagnosis of malignant melanoma, stages IIB-IV in radiologically confirmed
             complete clinical remission without clinical evidence of disease

          -  At least 4 weeks since surgery prior to first dosing of study agent

          -  Required values for initial laboratory tests:

               -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 10⁹/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 80 x 10⁹/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x mg/dL

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of institutional normal

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of institutional normal

          -  No active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 6 months

          -  Men and women, ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Adequate venous access (for Leukaphresis and blood draws)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious illnesses, e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics

          -  Previous bone marrow or stem cell transplant

          -  Study subjects with known chronic infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C. Testing will
             be performed if a study subject exhibits clinical signs of infection or to confirm a
             history of infection

          -  Study subjects with known autoimmune disease [e.g. SLE, RA] who have had significant
             symptoms within the past 3 years. Study subjects with vitiligo are not excluded

          -  Metastatic disease to the central nervous system

          -  Other malignancy within 3 years prior to entry into the study, except for treated
             early-stage melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or
             incidental or localized prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy or radiation
             therapy, or stage I colon cancer. Patients with other completely resected malignancies
             in the prior three years and no evidence of disease will be evaluated on a case- by-
             case basis with eligibility determined based on discussion with the Principal
             Investigator.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or tumor vaccine therapy or biological therapy for treatment of
             melanoma. Subjects who received chemotherapy for the management of other malignancies
             are potentially eligible if the subject has not received chemotherapy in prior 5
             years, remained disease free, and following discussion with and agreement by the
             principal investigator.

          -  Radiation therapy or major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study agent

          -  Concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids greater than physiologic doses.
             Topical (but not at the proposed vaccination sites) or inhalational steroids are
             permitted

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
             within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study agent

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Pregnancy is associated with considerable immune suppression
             and this additional parameter may interfere with the evaluation of dendritic cell
             induced immune responses in melanoma study subjects. Pregnancy test must be negative
             on all women of reproductive potential at baseline (within 7 days of entry into the
             study) and they must agree to use birth control measures while on the study.

          -  Study subjects previously treated with one of the peptides used in this trial,
             melanoma protein vaccine, melanoma whole cell vaccines, or with Montanide are not
             eligible

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of study agents hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs

          -  Lack of availability of study subject for immunological and clinical follow up
             assessments

          -  Children &lt; 18 years of age

          -  Allergy to shellfish
