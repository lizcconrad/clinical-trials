      Background:

      Studies show a high and growing prevalence of mental disorders in the population worldwide.
      25 % of the general population in Europe will during their lifetime experience symptoms
      related to a mental disorder. The Mental Health First Aid concept (MHFA) was founded in 2000
      in Australia by Kitchener and Jorm, in order to provide the population with mental health
      first aid skills.

      Objective:

      The aim of the concept is, through an educational intervention (course), to increase
      confidence in how to help people suffering from mental health problems. Further, secondary
      aims are to increase the mental health literacy of the public by increasing knowledge, reduce
      stigma and initiate more supportive actions leading towards professional help. An
      investigation of the effect of MHFA offered a Danish population is needed.

      Design and Methods:

      The design is a randomized controlled superiority trial, in which 500 participants will be
      allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The control group will
      attend the course six months later, hence waiting list design. From fall 2013 to spring 2014
      participants will be educated in Mental Health First-aid following a manualized, two days
      MHFA course. All the participants will answer a questionnaire at base-line and at 6 months
      follow-up. The questionnaire is a back-translation of the questionnaire used in Australian
      trials. The trial will be complemented by a qualitative study, in which focus groups will be
      carried out.

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome measure is increased confidence in help-giving behavior among the
      participants. Secondary outcome will be increased knowledge of and improved positive
      attitudes towards people suffering from a mental health problem.
