  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study, which included 845 patients that at the time of ICU discharge had at least
      one risk factor for readmission, the investigators' group developed a new readmission risk
      score in the ICU, Safe Discharge from ICU (SD-ICU), using parameters easily and routinely
      measured in ICU: the Charlson comorbidity (ICC), the TISS-28 (Therapeutic Intervention
      Scoring System - 28), the length of stay in ICU and age. Through ROC curve analysis, the
      investigators found that patients with a score above 14.5 had a high probability of
      readmission.

      The objective of this study is to validate the Safe Discharge from ICU (SD-ICU) score as a
      tool to predict unplanned readmissions to the intensive care unit.

      All adult patients discharged from a 37 bed general ICU from April 2014 to March 2015 will be
      included in the study. The SD-ICU score is routinely calculated at the time of discharge from
      the ICU. Patients will be divided into two groups: those with SD-ICU score&gt; 14.5 (group 1)
      and those with a score equal to or less than 14.5 (group 2). The two groups will be compared
      with respect to the frequency of unplanned readmissions. Stepwise, multivariate logistic
      regression will be used to investigate the association between the risk factors for
      readmission used in SD-ICU score and ICU readmission as outcome.
