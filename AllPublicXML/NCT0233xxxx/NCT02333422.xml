      The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to establish the effectiveness of NIRS
      Neurofeedback training in reducing the intensity of ADHD symptom expression on children,
      improvement of the cognitive and global functions associated with ADHD, effects on cerebral
      blood perfusion in the cortex and safety plus possible unknown side-effects.

      Background:

      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a mental condition originating in
      childhood, characterized by symptoms of lack attention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness
      associated with significant functional impairment. Currently, the use of neurofeedback as a
      non-drug alternative technique for treatment of ADHD has increasingly spread among the
      clinical and academic fields, producing relevant findings with regard to its effectiveness.
      The SCP Neurofeedback and EEG Neurofeedback have been the most studied techniques until the
      moment, with equipments and systems made available to the market at prices between US$ 10.000
      and US$ 20.000, while NIRS Neurofeedback equipments can be found for around US$ 2.000. Due to
      the low cost of the necessary equipment's and easy access to the technology, the use of NIRS
      Neurofeedback was opted for in the search to evaluate the techniques effectiveness in the
      improvement of ADHD symptoms as well as the patients' cognitive performance.

      This research is an open label treatment trial with NIRS Neurofeedback training of frontal
      and pre frontal lobes activation in children school-aged 7 - 12 years old with ADHD. Ten
      participants will be recruited over 3 months and will be offered 24 NIRS Neurofeedback
      sessions over 12 weeks, 2 sessions per week. The present study will be carried out as part of
      the care routine of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Services at Hospital de Clínicas de
      Porto Alegre. Primary outcome will be standard clinical behavioural rating scales. Secondary
      outcomes will include neuropsychological parameters, neurofunctional parameters using SPECT
      (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography), global function, quality of life assessment,
      side effects and tolerability.

    <description>The sensor will be placed on 4 specific regions defined by the International 10/20 System for Electrode Placement. F7, Fp1, Fp2 and F8. Each region will be initially trained for 4 minutes, with the eyes open, gradually increasing training time throughout the sessions to a maximum of 10 minutes. Training will amount to 24 sessions, occurring 2 times per week over a period of 3 moths. The procedure will be interrupted at any time, should the subject demonstrate the desire to stop.</description>
