  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A protocol of intervention for fine motor skills will be performed on institutionalized
      elderly people.

      This protocol consist on implementation of a manual activity that it is well known in the
      clinical setting.

      This activity will enhance several skills such as strength, coordination of upper limbs,
      range of motion, general auto-efficacy and the quality of life.

      The intervention or rehabilitation will be implemented for two month.
