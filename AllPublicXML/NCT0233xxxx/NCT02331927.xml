    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the two phase PERMAD trial is the evaluation of the impact of a
      personalized marker-driven treatment approach with early detection of progression and
      modification of treatment on cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAF) and efficacy.

      In regard of the two parts, the primary objective of the run-in phase (n=50 patients) with
      conventional switch of chemotherapy together with the anti-angiogenic agent is the
      determination of a distinct cytokines and angiogenic factor (CAF) profile during treatment
      with FOLFOX and bevacizumab, which allows early detection/prediction of progressive disease.
      The primary objective of the marker-driven randomized part (n=150 patients) with
      marker-driven switch of antiangiogenic agent and maintenance of chemotherapy is the
      evaluation of the efficacy of an early marker-driven switch of anti-angiogenic treatment
      (bevacizumab to aflibercept)

      This is a multicentre, multinational, open labeled, prospective, randomized, controlled phase
      II study designed to assess the clinical utility of an early marker driven change of
      anti-angiogenic treatment (bevacizumab to aflibercept) maintaining the chemotherapy backbone
      until definite radiological progression in first line treatment of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer. After completing the run in phase of the study, with at least 30 patients
      completing their first line treatment (due to progression, secondary resection or toxicity)
      and being evaluable for CAF analyses, the results will be reviewed by an Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Based on that review the decision to continue with, modify or
      cancel the randomized part will be made.

      The primary endpoint of the run-in phase with conventional switch of chemotherapy together
      with the anti-angiogenic agent is:

      • Progression free survival (PFS1) of first line treatment

      The primary endpoint of the randomized part with marker-driven switch of antiangiogenic agent
      and maintenance of chemotherapy is:

      • Progression free survival rate at 6 months (PFSR@6) after first cycle after randomization.
