  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a dynamic process from fit (robust) and pre-frail elderly. There is no previous
      study that determine the risk factors from fit to pre-frailty and pre-frailty to frailty in
      Indonesian elderly.

      This study was aimed to define the risk factors of frailty transitional status and its
      correlation with quality of life in Indonesian elderly outpatients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is an age-associated, biological syndrome characterized by decreased biological
      reserves, due to dysregulation of several physiological systems, which puts an individual at
      risk when facing minor stressors, and is associated with poor outcomes (ie, disability,
      death, and hospitalization).

      Frailty identifies a high-risk subgroup and off ers characteristics of great clinical
      importance: a higher reversibility at early stages than disability, and a higher predictive
      value than chronic disease for adverse outcomes at older ages. It is also the most common
      condition leading to death in community-dwelling older people.

      However, there is current consensus that physical frailty is potentially reversible. It is
      hence useful to objectively detect frailty among frail elderly persons, as frailty indices
      serve a useful purpose for risk stratification, predicting need for institutional care and
      planning of services needed.

      To date, there is no study or information about frailty status in Indonesia elderly. This
      study was aimed to define the risk factors of frailty transitional status and its correlation
      with quality of life in Indonesian elderly.
