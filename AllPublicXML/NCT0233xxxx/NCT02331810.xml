      Primary Objective:

      Assess in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients the effect of SAR113244 on B-cell
      subsets compared to placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Assess in male and female lupus patients after SC single dose of SAR113244 the tolerability
      and safety of SAR113244.

      Assess in male and female lupus patients:

        -  The pharmacokinetics of SAR113244.

        -  The pharmacodynamics of SAR113244 for the following disease parameters:

             -  Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment Systemic Lupus
                Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score, British Isles Lupus
                Assessment Group (BILAG) score (if applicable), BILAG-Based Composite Lupus
                Assessment (BICLA) (if applicable), systemic lupus erythematosus responder index
                (if applicable), Lupus-quality of life and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
                Therapy-Fatigue, anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody and
                anti-nuclear antibody levels and plasma complement levels (C3, C4), erythrocyte
                sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.

             -  Peripheral blood B and T cell subsets.

      The total duration of screening to end of study per subject is 16 weeks with post-study
      observation on Day 198 for anti-drug antibody assessment (for patients with positive
      anti-drug antibody at end of study only).
