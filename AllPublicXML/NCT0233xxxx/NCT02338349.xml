  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      elacestrant (RAD1901) in patients with advanced ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of elacestrant in patients with advanced ER+HER2-negative breast cancer.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of elacestrant

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of elacestrant

        -  To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor effect of elacestrant

    <description>Part A, Dose Escalation: Patients will be assigned sequentially to escalating doses of elacestrant.
Part B, Safety Expansion: Once the MTD has been identified and/or a RP2D has been selected, additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the RP2D.
Part C, Tablet Introduction: A cohort of patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of a tablet dosage form at 400 mg QD.
Part D, Dose Expansion: A cohort of patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor effect of elacestrant in tablet dosage form at 400 mg QD PO in a group of patients with a more homogeneous prior treatment history</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be post-menopausal women, as defined in the protocol

          2. 18 years or older

          3. Patients with histological or cytological proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             breast with evidence of either locally advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic disease

          4. Part A, B, C: Patients must have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapeutic
             regimens and at least 6 months of prior endocrine therapy

          5. Part D: Patients may have received up to 1 previous line of chemotherapy and must have
             previously received 2 or more lines of endocrine therapy for advanced/metastatic
             breast cancer as a single agent or in combination. Patients must have received
             fulvestrant as one of the previous lines of endocrine therapy and have had documented
             progression while on, or within 1 month after the end of, fulvestrant therapy for
             advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Patients must have received prior treatment with a
             CDK4/6 inhibitor

        Note: This list is not complete. Further inclusion criteria is provided in the protocol
        synopsis.
