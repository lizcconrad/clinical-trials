  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study, in healthy volunteers who have previously been immunized with
      bacilli Calmette Guerin (BCG), to evaluate the safety and immune responses that develop in
      the blood and lungs following the administration by aerosol of a new experimental
      adenovirus-based vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), Ad5Ag85A.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single
      administration of escalating doses of a recombinant replication deficient human adenoviral
      (Ad5) TB vaccine containing the immunodominant antigen Ag85A delivered to the respiratory
      tract by aerosol in healthy volunteers with a history of BCG immunization.

      36 healthy volunteers will be enrolled and administered escalating doses of vaccine using the
      AeroNeb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer. At the highest dose, participants will be randomized
      to inhaled or intramuscular administration. Cellular immune responses in the lung and
      peripheral blood will be evaluated

             attend scheduled study visits and complete required investigations.

          4. For women, negative pregnancy test and practicing two acceptable forms of
             contraception for the duration of the study (barrier contraceptive, birth control
             pill, surgically sterile, post-menopausal 2 years, abstinence)

          5. For men, using barrier contraception for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             relevant findings on physical examination or are receiving any drug treatment in the
             opinion of the investigator likely to affect the immune system including current use
             of inhaled or nasal steroids.

          3. Subjects with a history of any bleeding disorder or receiving any drug treatment that
             in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk of bleeding

          4. Subjects with a history of respiratory disease, e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis,
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

          5. Current smokers and ex-smokers who have quit within the last year, as reported by the
             subject

          6. Subjects with clinically significant abnormality of baseline spirometry tests

             responsive to ESAT6/CFP10 stimulation using a commercial interferon gamma release
             assay for TB [consistent with latent TB infection].

          9. Subjects whose baseline laboratory values are outside of the normal range unless the
             abnormality is considered not to be of clinical relevance by the Investigator. A
             single repeat test is allowed during the screening period.

         10. Subjects whose use of alcohol or drugs would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             interfere with adherence to the study protocol.

         11. Subjects who are using, or have a history of using, inhaled cocaine, metamphetamine or
             other inhaled or smoked recreational drugs. Subjects who give a history of last
             smoking marijuana more than a year ago may be enrolled.

         12. Failure to provide written consent.

         13. Known allergy to vaccine components

         14. Previous vaccination with Ad5Ag85A or any other experimental TB vaccine

         15. Known exposure to active TB within past 6 months or subjects whose occupation puts
             them at increased risk of TB exposure (based on Hamilton Health Science/St Joseph
             Healthcare list of high risk personnel)

         16. Any abnormality on chest x-ray suggestive of active or remote tuberculosis infection
