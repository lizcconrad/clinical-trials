    <description>Bacteriologic failure: During the treatment period, failure to attain culture conversion to negative.
Bacteriologic relapse: During the follow-up period, failure to maintain culture conversion to negative status in culture, with culture conversion to positive status with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) strain that is genetically identical to the infecting strain at baseline.
Clinical failure: A change from protocol-specified TB treatment due to treatment failure, retreatment for TB during follow up, or TB-related death.

             ii. Current treatment not listed above that renders subject eligible for the study in

             for 6 months (both male and female Subjects) after the last dose of study medication
             or discontinuation from study medication in case of premature discontinuation.

        Note: Hormone based contraception alone may not be reliable when taking investigational
        medicinal products; therefore, hormone based contraceptives alone cannot be used by female
        Subjects or female partners of male Subjects to prevent pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria Medical History

             uncontrolled diabetes or cardiomyopathy, extra-pulmonary TB requiring extended
             treatment), where participation in the trial would compromise the well-being of
             Subject or prevent, limit or confound protocol specified assessments.

          2. Abuse of alcohol or illegal drugs, that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             compromise the Subjects' safety or ability to follow through with all
             protocol-specified visits and evaluations.

          3. In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient is not expected to survive for more

             having a CD4+ count &gt;50 cells/Î¼L;

             a. Currently treated with or will need to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) which
             is not compatible with the allowed ARTs and is not considered an appropriate candidate
             for switching to a regimen of ARVs which is allowed. Examples of allowed treatment
             include but are not limited to the following. If there are any questions, discuss with
             the Sponsor Medical Monitor for confirmation of appropriate ARV regimen.

             i. Nevirapine based regimen consisting of nevirapine in combination with any NRTIs;

             ii. Lopinavir/ritonavir (Aluviaâ„¢) based regimen consisting of lopinavir/ritonavir
             (Aluviaâ„¢) in combination with any NRTIs;

             iii. The combination of tenofovir/lamivudine/abacavir should be considered in patients
             with normal renal function to address myelosuppression cross toxicity of idovudine and
             linezolid;

             iv. An alternate regimen that may be considered if the above are not appropriate is a
             triple nucleosidase reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) based regimen consisting
             of zidovudine, lamivudine and abacavir may be used with caution. Regimens including
             zidovudine should be used with special caution as zivovudine and linezolid may both
             cause peripheral nerve toxicity;

             v. Raltegravir in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
             (NRTIs). b. Cannot ensure a 2 week interval between commencing IMP and the start of

               4. Subjects with other cardiac abnormalities that may place them at risk of
                  arrhythmias must be discussed with the sponsor medical monitor before enrolment.
