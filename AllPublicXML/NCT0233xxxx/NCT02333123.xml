      This efficacy study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of aspirin for venous leg ulcer
      healing. The study also examines whether patients can be recruited to a larger study.
      Patients with chronic venous leg ulceration presenting and undergoing care in leg ulcer
      community clinics or hospital out-patient clinics, or registered with a clinic but are
      receiving care at home will be recruited. All patients will receive standard compression
      bandaging. Half of the participants will be randomised to receive aspirin, while the other
      half will receive a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay of treatment of leg ulcers is graded compression therapy to squeeze the fluid
      out of the leg and venous system. This has been shown to be effective in many clinical
      trials. However, despite this treatment patients take many months to heal (with median
      healing times of approximately 12 weeks in previous trials) and for some patients compression
      therapy does not result in resolution of their leg ulcers. The use of compression (as well as
      dressings largely to manage the wound exudate) can be expensive as nurse time is required to
      change bandages which can be required weekly or more frequently. Furthermore, for many
      patients the compression therapy is uncomfortable (sometimes painful) and inconvenient for
      everyday life (compression is bulky and dressings have to be changed several times weekly).
      If other treatments were able to reduce the time to healing then this would be a significant
      breakthrough.

      Results from two earlier small trials suggest aspirin may be of benefit. However this trials
      were poorly designed and reported. The present study will evaluate whether the addition of
      300mg of daily aspirin to standard evidence based therapies reduces the time to healing of
      chronic venous leg ulceration using a more rigorous design. The study will also establish the
      feasibility of satisfactory participant recruitment for a bigger trial, and whether
      participants are compliant with their aspirin therapy. The safety of aspirin in this patient
      population will also be monitored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Those with at least one chronic venous leg ulcer - where chronic venous leg ulceration
             is defined as any break in the skin which has either: a) been present for more than
             six weeks, or b) occurred in a person with a history of venous leg ulceration. Ulcers
             will be considered purely venous if clinically no other etiology was suspected. For
             this the ulcer must be venous in appearance (i.e. moist, shallow, of an irregular
             shape) and lie wholly or partially within the gaiter region of the leg. If the patient
             has more than one ulcer we will choose the largest ulcer as the 'index' lesion for
             purposes of the analysis.

          -  Ulcer area &gt; 1 square cm

          -  Participants must have had an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) ≥ 0.8 taken within
             the previous three months. When the ABPI is incompressible other forms of assessment
             including peripheral pulse examination / toe pressure / duplex ultrasound in
             combination with clinical judgement to be used to exclude PAD

          -  Aged ≥ 18 years (no upper age limit)

          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent

          -  Ulcer duration &gt; 6 weeks or prior history of venous ulceration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide consent

          -  Unwilling to provide consent

          -  Foot (below the ankle) ulcer

          -  A leg ulcer of non-venous aetiology (i.e. arterial)

          -  Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) &lt;0.8

          -  Current regular use of aspirin (as may be randomised to placebo)

          -  Previous intolerance of aspirin / contraindication to aspirin (decision made according
             to the prescribers' clinical judgement)

          -  Prohibited medication: Probenecid

          -  Known lactose intolerance (as placebo contains lactose)

          -  Pregnant/lactating women

          -  Currently participating in another study evaluating leg ulcer therapies.

          -  Another reason that excluded them from participating within this trial (decision made
             according to the nurses' or prescribers' clinical judgment )*

          -  Previously been recruited in to this trial.
