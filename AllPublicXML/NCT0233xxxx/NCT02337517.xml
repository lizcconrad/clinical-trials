    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well vismodegib works in treating patients with chronic
      graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to previous steroid treatment. Chronic
      graft-versus-host disease can cause a build-up of scar tissue under the skin and lead to
      symptoms such as sclerodermatous skin changes, dry mouth, dry eye, narrowing of the
      esophagus, or vaginal graft-versus-host disease. Vismodegib may work against the build-up of
      scar tissue and be a better treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by a
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical effects of GDC-0449 (vismodegib), in steroid-refractory chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of GDC-0449 in patients with steroid-refractory GVHD.

      II. To determine the change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria (CC)
      global score of chronic GVHD at 6 and 12 months from baseline.

      III. To determine one-year non relapse mortality (NRM) and one-year relapse rate.

      IV. To determine one-year failure free survival (FFS) and one-year overall survival (OS).

      V. To determine baseline clinical characteristics that may be associated with decreased FFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) daily, every other day, every three days, or twice
      weekly for 6-12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.
