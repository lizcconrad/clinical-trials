  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer, the most frequently diagnosed cancer among occidental men, is associated
      with a major individual and societal burden. Although still controversial, the literature
      suggests that a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (ω3) has protective effects against
      prostate cancer. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of ω3 lies in their
      anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, there are some observational evidences suggesting
      an association of ω3 intake with a lower rate of depression in cancer patients. However, no
      clinical study has tested the efficacy of ω3 supplementation on psychological and quality of
      life outcomes in that population. Several evidences point to a possible involvement of
      inflammation in psychological issues. Reducing the systemic inflammatory state may have
      beneficial impact on the quality of life of these patients. Preliminary work from this team
      of investigators, in a cohort of patients managed with active surveillance for their
      low-grade prostate cancer, show a strong inverse association between the risk of prostate
      cancer progression (to high-grade) and the level of prostatic eicosapentanoic acid (EPA- a
      type of ω3).

      HYPOTHESIS: EPA-rich monoglycerides fish oil (MAG-EPA) has global positive effects on
      prostate cancer cell proliferation, inflammation and on the patient's psychosocial
      functioning and quality of life.

      The investigators propose a double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. 130
      consecutive patients suffering from high-risk prostate cancer who choose to be treated by
      radical prostatectomy will be eligible to this study. The presence of high-grade cancer will
      be mandatory.

      The intervention, a daily supplementation with 3g supplement of fish oil monoglycerides rich
      in EPA, vs. placebo capsules containing high oleic sunflower oil, will start six weeks before
      the prostatectomy and will continue for one year after surgery. The potential confounding
      variables will be measured before the start of the intervention: age, anthropometric
      parameters, stage and clinical and pathological tumor grade (Gleason score), pre-operative
      level of prostate specific antigen and diet.

      This project proposes a simple intervention by dietary supplementation that could eventually
      help to reduce the incidence and/or progression of prostate cancer, and the consequences of
      its treatment, and thus could contribute to diminish the heavy individual and societal burden
      of prostate cancer. The clinical data generated by this trial will serve as solid basis for a
      large-scale phase III clinical trial.

    <measure>Change in Inflammatory mediators levels- Systemic</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in levels of systemic inflammatory mediators, relative to their baseline levels, at the time of radical prostatectomy and at one year post-radical prostatectomy, will be measured. The levels of mediators will be expressed in pg/mL and quantified using validated techniques.</description>

    <measure>Modulation of Inflammatory mediators levels - Prostatic</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The differences in the levels of expression of inflammatory mediators between both treatment groups will be measured in the peripheral zone of the prostate before surgical prostate dissection/ischemia. The levels of mediators will be expressed in pg/mL and quantified using validated techniques. Further validation could be performed using immunohistochemistry techniques.</description>
