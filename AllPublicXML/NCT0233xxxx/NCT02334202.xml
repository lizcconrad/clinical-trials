      This research study is aimed at the prevention of excessive weight gain in female military
      dependents at high risk for adult obesity. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      reducing Loss of Control (LOC) eating and associated indicators through use of interpersonal
      psychotherapy (IPT) will be feasible and acceptable to female adolescent dependents who
      report such behaviors. Moreover, patterns in the data will be examined to assess whether IPT
      influences body weight gain trajectories and prevent worsening disordered eating and
      metabolic functioning among female military dependents at heightened risk for unhealthy
      weight gain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increased prevalence of obesity among the children of military personnel has paralleled
      that observed in the civilian population. Disordered eating, especially binge or loss of
      control (LOC) eating, is common among adolescents and is a salient risk factor for obesity
      and the development of exacerbated disordered eating and depressive symptoms. The goal of
      this study is to test the effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to slow the
      trajectory of weight gain in adolescent girls at high-risk for adult obesity by virtue of
      elevated body mass index (BMI) percentile and LOC eating. IPT targets the difficult social
      functioning and stressful events that are associated with LOC and highly relevant to the
      adolescent youth from military families. Adolescent military dependents will be randomized to
      receive either the IPT weight gain prevention program or a health education (HE) control
      condition, for 12 weekly group sessions. Adolescents' weight status, eating behaviors, and
      mood will be assessed at baseline, immediately following the prevention program (12-weeks),
      and at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year and 3-year follow-up time points, participants' BMI and
      physiologic data will be collected via the Military Health System's electronic medical record
      system. It is hypothesized that adolescents who receive the IPT group program will show
      significantly less weight gain (or more weight loss) relative to those randomized to HE at
      3-year follow-up. Additionally, it is hypothesized that adolescents receiving IPT (as
      compared to HE) will demonstrate improvements on secondary outcomes of interest, including
      the presence and frequency of classic binge eating episodes, as well as obesity-related
      physiological measures of health (e.g., fasting insulin). The overall goal of the study is to
      prevent excess weight gain and adult obesity, and to prevent worsening disordered eating and
      metabolic functioning among overweight military dependents at risk for adult obesity and
      binge eating disorders.

    <description>Participants will have 1 individual pre-group session when each participant meets with the group leaders so that they can learn about each girl's significant relationships, set goals for the program, and so each girl can learn about group participation and format. Participants then will begin IPT-WG which is designed to decrease excessive weight gain among adolescents ages 12-17 years who are at risk for adult obesity. The IPT-WG program has been adapted to be appropriate for military dependents. The IPT-WG group meets for 12 consecutive, weekly group meetings and involves developing strategies for dealing with the problems girls struggle with that may lead to increased eating. At the 6th week of the group, the group leaders meet with each participant to review their progress and goals.</description>

    <description>The health education group will follow the &quot;HEY-Durham&quot; health program designed by researchers at Duke University. This program, designed to be delivered to youth attending community high schools, was adapted to a 12-week program (each with a 90 minute session). Girls will come in for a 1.5-hour group meeting once a week for 12 weeks (12 times total). Before beginning the group, girls will meet with group leaders to review each adolescent's family health history. The curriculum includes focus on various health topics, including avoiding alcohol, drug and tobacco use, nutrition and body image, nonviolent conflict resolution, sun safety, exercise, and domestic violence.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female

          -  Age between 12 and 17 years (at the start of the study)

          -  English-speaking

          -  Ability to complete study procedures, including ability to participate in a group

          -  Endorsement of at least one LOC criteria, as assessed by Eating Disorder Examination
             (EDE) semi structured interview

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a chronic major medical illness: : renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper- or hypothyroidism), hematological
             problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring continuous
             medication). Non-serious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be
             reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

          -  Presence of a documented, obesity-related medical complication that would require a
             more aggressive weight loss intervention approach: type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
             hypertension, fasting hyperglycemia, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

          -  Documented or self-reported current pregnancy, current breast-feeding, or recently
             pregnant girls (within 1 year of delivery). Because pregnancy is a state in which
             weight gain is expected and appropriate, pregnant individuals would not be suitable
             for this study. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of birth
             control. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives (&quot;the
             pill&quot;), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or
             medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). If one of these cannot be
             used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended. Should a participant in the
             IPT-WG group become pregnant during the ~12 weeks of the group program, she will be
             excluded from the group sessions. The study team will closely assist in obtaining an
             appropriate referral to a community mental healthcare provider, as indicated, and will
             request a release of information so that they may facilitate a smooth transition for
             the girl.

          -  Current, regular use of prescription medications that affect appetite, mood, or body
             weight: currently prescribed SSRI's, neuroleptics, tricyclics, stimulants, or any
             other medication known to affect appetite, mood, or body weight. Oral contraceptive
             use will be permitted, provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two
             months before starting the prevention groups. Medication use for non-serious
             conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

          -  Current involvement in psychotherapy or a structured weight loss program.

          -  Weight loss during the past two months for any reason exceeding 3% of body weight.

          -  Current anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa as determined by documented medical
             history or if uncovered during K-SADS semi-structured interview. Current binge eating
             disorder will be permitted. Girls with anorexia or bulimia nervosa will be referred to
             mental health specialists for further evaluation and treatment. Individuals who need
             further behavioral health or medical services will be accommodated through their
             primary care medical home in accordance with normal clinical standard of care. This
             will be accomplished by direct communication with the patients' primary care
             physician.

          -  Individuals who have major depressive disorder, psychoses, current substance or
             alcohol abuse, conduct disorder, as determined by Kiddie Schedule for Affective
             Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) semi-structured interview and as defined by
             criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
             (DSM-IV-TR) or any other DSM-IV-TR psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the
             investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of
             the study.
