  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Earlier studies have shown that pharmacists detect and solve drug related problems (DRPs)
      when they are a part of the multidisciplinary treatment-team at hospital wards. However, in
      the Norwegian health care system, there is a lack of studies on the effect of pharmacist
      intervention on clinically relevant outcomes. Hospital readmissions has both clinical and
      economical negative effects, and time outside the hospital until an eventual readmission is
      considered as a clinical relevant outcome measure. The investigators are conducting a
      randomized controlled trial at an internal medicine ward at Oslo University Hospital. 400
      acute admitted patients using minimum 4 regular drugs from minimum 2 drug groups will be
      enrolled in the study. Patients randomized to the Control group will receive standard care
      (without a pharmacist involved) and patients randomized to the Intervention group will
      receive a pharmacist in their treatment team during the hospital stay. The study hypothesis
      is that including a pharmacist in the multidisciplinary treatment team at a hospital ward,
      will improve the patients drug treatment, hence lead to an increased time outside the
      hospital until an eventual readmission.

      The investigators have approved protocol amendment to use the data from the study. The
      investigators aim to identify these patients by building a statistical model based on
      significant variables from the data collected in the ongoing randomised controlled trial. The
      hypothesis for the first part of the project is that a set of patient characteristics can
      identify patients who are at high risk of drug-related readmissions and who would benefit
      most from the pharmaceutical intervention. The model will be validated using data from 100
      new patients admitted to the internal medicine ward.
