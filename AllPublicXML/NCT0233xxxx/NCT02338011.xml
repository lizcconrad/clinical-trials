      1. Compare the effect and safety of gefitinib alone with gefitinib plus concomitant
           WBRT(whole-brain radiotherapy ) in treatment of NSCLC patients harboring an EGFR
           mutation with multiple BM.

        2. Verify the failure pattern of NSCLC patients harboring an EGFR mutation with multiple
           BM.

        3. Explore the rescuable therapy after progression of disease.

      All patients will be randomized to receive gefitinib or gefitinib concurrent WBRT until
      progression of disease. Gefitinib concurrent WBRT, patients were given gefitinib 250mg per
      day concurrently with WBRT(whole-brain radiotherapy ). Dose reduction was allowed for
      intolerable adverse effects such as rash(grade 4)、diarrhea(grade 3-4) or non hematological
      toxicity(grade 3-4) from 250mg per day to 250mg every other day then to 250mg every three
      days if needed. WBRT was delivered in 3.0 Gy(Gray)fractions once per day 5 days per week to a
      total dose of 30Gy (10 fractions). Radiation was delivered as opposed lateral 6-MV(Micro
      Voltage) beams with Varian linear accelerator.
