    <textblock>
      Ischemic limb disease remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the
      industrialized world despite the development of several new therapeutic modalities. Based on
      experimental data demonstrating that infusion or injection of stem/progenitor cells enhances
      blood flow in models of cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials were initiated in 2001 to
      treat patients with critical limb ischemia or cardiac ischemia with circulating blood or bone
      marrow-derived cells. Despite all promises, pending uncertainties and practical limitations
      attenuate the therapeutic use of stem/progenitor cells for ischemic limb disease. The main
      theme and method in the current program project, based on expertise, track record, and
      preliminary results of PI's laboratory, is to focus on clinical studies of using allogenic
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), expanded under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), in treating
      ischemic limbs. This project is an integrated and coordinated effort aimed to overcome the
      regulation of cell product, and the barriers of preclinical and clinical studies. For the
      purposes, we have specially set up the core laboratory for stem/progenitor cells production
      and quality control in Cell Therapy Clean Room on the 9th floor of Medical Science Technology
      Building in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We have also completed the preclinical studies
      in using allogenic hypoxic mouse MSCs in treating limb ischemia. In the current project, bone
      marrow MSCs will be isolated from allogenic donors, expanded under hypoxic conditions using
      medium containing no serum or animal-derived reagents, and applies for Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study in
      treating 18 recipients with ischemic limb diseases in three years.
