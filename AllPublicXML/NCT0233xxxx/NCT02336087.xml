    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, metformin hydrochloride, and a standardized
      dietary supplement in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes, may also help kill cancer cells.
      Dietary supplements (curcumin, vitamin D, vitamin K2, vitamin K1, B-6, high selenium broccoli
      sprouts, epigallocatechin gallate, L-carnitine, garlic extract, genistein, zinc amino
      chelate, mixed toxopherols, ascorbic acid, D-limonene) can block different targets in the
      cancer cell simultaneously and may slow down cancer growth. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride,
      paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and metformin hydrochloride with a
      dietary supplement may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be
      removed by surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the compliance, toxicity and feasibility of administering gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride), Abraxane (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation), metformin (metformin hydrochloride), and the dietary supplement (DS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate associated with this combination therapy in pancreatic cancer
      patients.

      II. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival of all patients who start
      protocol therapy, and describe the outcomes based on measures of compliance during the
      lead-in week, and compliance with supplement during chemotherapy.

      III. To collect and analyze peripheral blood and pre-treatment biopsy samples for an
      exploratory analysis of biological correlatives.

      IV. To assess quality of life utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
      (FACT-G) questionnaire.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive metformin
      hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) starting day -6 and dietary supplement PO BID
      starting day -3. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

    <description>The percent of patients who are fully compliant in the first week will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval. The compliance will be measured similarly for each course prior to study treatment discontinuation. The impact of less than full compliance (both during the lead-in period and during chemotherapy) on the biomarkers and outcome, and qualitatively study patient reasons and specific supplement patterns related to non-compliance will be explored.</description>
