  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of parental opioid use disorder and other substance use exposure on child welfare
      and the healthcare system is undeniable. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of delivering
      mothers using or dependent on opiates rose nearly five-fold, and it is estimated that 48-94%
      of children exposed to opioids in utero will be diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome
      (NAS), a set of behavioral and physiological complications resulting from abrupt substance
      withdrawal at birth. Opioid abuse is usually coupled with use of other substances, and
      research has demonstrated that children born to parents with substance use disorders are
      three to four times more likely to suffer abuse or neglect.

      Currently, the standard of care for pregnant women who are being treated for opiate
      dependence at Boston Medical Center (BMC) is to receive all their prenatal care in the
      RESPECT Clinic, an innovative program of the BMC Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
      designed to treat addiction during the prenatal and early postnatal period. Once the child is
      born, BMC staff files a report of suspected child abuse and neglect in accordance with the
      Massachusetts General Laws section 51A. The state Department of Children and Families makes a
      determination regarding the disposition of these families. Medically, most of these children
      are treated in-patient at BMC for NAS and then discharged to follow-up with routine pediatric
      primary care. Currently, approximately 85% of infants born exposed to opioids go home with
      their mothers, and the remainder receive substitute care, either with other family members or
      via foster care.

      This investigation is a randomized controlled trial of RESPECT-Plus, a continuum of promising
      and evidence-based practices designed to strengthen family protective factors and improve
      health permanency and well-being outcomes for children born to mothers in treatment for
      opioid use disorder. Anticipated outcomes of the intervention include fewer reports of
      supported child abuse or neglect filings in the child's first year of life, fewer days in
      out-of-home placement; fewer terminations of parental rights in the child's first year of
      life; and improvements in family functions overall (e.g. improved access to basic
      needs/social determinants of health, improved parental resilience, and decreased maternal
      depression).

      Project RESPECT-Plus (Recovery, Empowerment, Social Services, Prenatal care, Education, and
      Community Treatment-Plus) is a randomized controlled trial of promising and evidence-based
      practices designed to strengthen family protective factors and improve health permanency and
      well-being outcomes for children born to mothers in treatment for opioid use disorder. The
      target population for project RESPECT-Plus is pregnant women in treatment for opiate use
      disorder receiving prenatal care at BMC's RESPECT Clinic. A total of 200 subjects - 100
      mothers - will be enrolled into the study and randomized post-partum to receive the
      intervention or standard of care, and will be followed for 1 year.

      In order to provide continuity of care from the prenatal to pediatric primary care setting,
      participants receiving prenatal care at the RESPECT Clinic are recruited during their third
      trimester of pregnancy. After consent, the initial baseline data collection is scheduled and
      once the infants are born and pass the eligibility screening (term birth and no major
      congenital abnormalities or developmental disabilities), mothers and their infants are
      randomized into the intervention (RESPECT-Plus) or control (standard of care) group.

      The intervention is delivered by a family specialist who, with the permission of the mother,
      will attend routine well-child visits so as to collaborate with providers in the child's
      medical home and parent through the medical visit. As desired by the mother, home visits,
      other face-to-face contacts, telephone calls, and text messages will assist in addressing
      social determinants of health, improve the mother's knowledge of child development and
      parenting, and link families to community resources to address existing concrete support
      needs. The family specialist will receive support and training by a licensed clinical social
      worker and the Medical-Legal Partnership, Boston (MLP Boston) to identify legal and social
      needs that may affect a child's health and development and to take action either by helping
      family members advocate for themselves, or by referring them to an appropriate public health,
      legal, or social service agency or resources.

      Both the intervention and standard of care groups will be evaluated by research evaluators
      not associated with the intervention at baseline, and when the child is 6 and 12 months old.

      The two goals and associated objectives for RESPECT-Plus are:

        1. To evaluate the RESPECT-Plus intervention, on improving child well-being, safety, and
           permanency outcomes.

        2. To evaluate family functioning aligned with the five protective factors in the
           Strengthening Families model (parental resilience, knowledge of parenting and child
           development, concrete supports, social connections, and child factors).

      Anticipated outcomes of the intervention include fewer reports of supported child abuse or
      neglect filings in the child's first year of life, fewer days in out-of-home placement and
      terminations of parental rights in the child's first year of life, and improvements in family
      functions overall (e.g. improved access to basic needs/social determinants of health,
      improved parental resilience, and decreased maternal depression).

    <description>A RESPECT-Plus family specialist (FS) will deliver the intervention to subjects (mothers in treatment for opiate use disorder) recruited during their third trimester of pregnancy and randomized into the study's intervention arm post-delivery. During their infant's hospital stay, the FS will schedule a convenient time to meet the subjects (mothers) to educate them on infant soothing techniques. With permission from the mother, the FS will join the subjects during their infant's routine well-child visits at the pediatric primary site. Optional home visiting provides another meeting opportunity between the subjects and FS.</description>
