  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing neurorehabilitation literature suggests that intense treatment may be desired to
      maximize the effects of therapy following neurologic injury. This investigation is designed
      to facilitate the development of efficacious, clinically applicable treatment for acquired
      apraxia of speech by examining the effects of intensity of treatment (e.g., 9 hours per week
      vs. 3 hours per week, while holding total number of sessions constant) with a group of
      speakers who have chronic apraxia of speech and aphasia.

      This research is designed to examine the effects of treatment intensity on outcomes
      associated with an established treatment for acquired apraxia of speech (AOS). Intensity in
      the form of dose frequency and total intervention duration will be evaluated with Sound
      Production Treatment (SPT). The investigators will examine the effects of intense dose
      frequency (nine, one-hour sessions per week) and traditional dose frequency (three, one hour
      sessions per week). Total number of treatment sessions will be held constant allowing for
      comparison of total intervention duration (27 sessions over 3 weeks versus 27 sessions over 9
      weeks). A two-phase, group cross-over design will be used. Thirty-six participants with
      chronic aphasia and AOS will be quasi-randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups -
      intense first or traditional first (18 per group). One group will receive SPT applied with
      intense dose frequency (SPT-I) followed by SPT applied with traditional dose frequency
      (SPT-T). The other group will receive the treatments in the reverse order (SPT-T followed by
      SPT-I). A two week no treatment interval will separate the treatment phases. The outcomes of
      interest will address changes in trained speech behaviors, untrained speech behaviors, and
      speech intelligibility and patient-rated communicative functioning.

    <description>Measure of how well an unfamiliar listener can understand speech. The Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech will be employed. The participant will repeat words which will be audiorecorded. A trained, but unfamiliar listener will orthographically transcribe the words that are produced. The transcriptions will be compared to the list of target (intended words) to determine a percentage of words that are correctly understood.</description>
