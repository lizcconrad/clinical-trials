  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal is a feasibility and acceptability study to establish the necessary
      groundwork for more detailed investigations into the role of CH in reducing symptoms and
      improving quality of life in NSCLC patients at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH). A
      standardized and easily administered form of CH will be used, incorporating a carefully
      selected combination of herbs designed to alleviate a range of common symptoms suffered by
      patients with advanced NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced NSCLC, in addition to their very poor chances of cure or extended
      survival, frequently suffer a range of different symptoms related to both their disease and
      its treatment. As a result there is a pressing need to develop more effective anti-cancer
      therapies and an imperative to enhance the effects of existing treatments and alleviate
      symptoms more effectively.

      Increasing numbers of patients with cancer are using complementary medicine, including
      Chinese herbs (CH), and evidence is accumulating from a growing number of laboratory studies
      and clinical trials, that CH may exert beneficial effects for cancer patients in many ways.

      The current proposal is a feasibility and acceptability study to establish the necessary
      groundwork for more detailed investigations into the role of CH in reducing symptoms and
      improving quality of life in NSCLC patients at the JGH. A standardized and easily
      administered form of CH will be used, incorporating a carefully selected combination of herbs
      designed to alleviate a range of common symptoms suffered by patients with advanced NSCLC.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of a 6-week clinical intervention with
      Chinese herbs in advanced (Stage 4) NSCLC patients All the active patients who have
      histologically or cytologically proven metastatic NSCLC with Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 -2 will be eligible to participate in the study. Quality
      of life will be assessed by FACT-L and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS)
      questionnaires. Patient will be instructed to complete a diary each day to confirm adherence
      to treatment and to indicate the reason(s) that any doses were missed or treatment was
      stopped.

    <description>All participants will be offered the choice of taking the CH formula in capsules or sachets in addition to standard care. This study will use the Shu Yu Wan formula which comprises 23 different herbs and is based on the best evidence in the literature of use of CH in lung cancer. The formula should be taken with meals 3 times a day (each dose is either 1 sachet or 4 capsules) for six-weeks.</description>
