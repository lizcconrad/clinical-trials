      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of extended
      dosing with a fixed dose of GCS-100 3 mg IV push in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
      (CKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with
      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin-3
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at
      treating patients with CKD.

      This study will consist of a fixed dose of GCS-100 3mg IV push at least every 30 days for a
      total of 1 year with a follow-up 4 weeks after the last dose is administered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and is able to
             provide written informed consent

          2. Subject was enrolled in GCS-100-CS-4003.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject experienced a Grade 3 or worse adverse event related to GCS-100 in clinical
             study GCS-100-CS-4003.

          2. Systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg and ≥160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≤40 mmHg
             and ≥100 mmHg at screening

          3. Subject has clinical laboratory values of:

               -  Hemoglobin: ≤9 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin: &gt;1.5X the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  ALT and/or AST: &gt;2.5X ULN

          4. Subject has a concomitant disease or condition, including laboratory abnormalities,
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the conduct of the
             study or put the subject at unacceptable risk.

          5. Subject who may require renal replacement therapy within the next 2 months, at the
             discretion of the investigator.
