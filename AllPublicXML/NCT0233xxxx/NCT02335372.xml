      Objectives:

      Primary Objective: To perform a pilot clinical study to test multi-modal optical imaging for
      detection of cervical neoplasia in Brazil.

      Secondary Objective: Analyze clinical data to establish the imaging modes which demonstrate
      the highest degree of correlation with disease state.

      Wide-field and high-resolution images of precancerous cervical lesions and normal uterine
      cervix will be obtained by imaging 357 patients, recruited from women presenting for
      colposcopic evaluation from the Prevention Department at Barretos Cancer Hospital, a MDACC
      Sister Institution, in Barretos, Brazil. Barretos Cancer Hospital will serve as the lead site
      for the study

      Initial wide-field white light images will be acquired in unpolarized and cross-polarized
      modes before application of 3-6% acetic acid. Routine colposcopy involves visual inspection
      of the cervix for aceto-whitening and will be followed by a second pair of white-light images
      in each polarization mode. The clinician will identify all sites required for biopsy
      according to clinical impression, marking each location on the recorded unpolarized white
      light image. Topical application of 0.01% proflavine solution will then be applied for 1
      minute, after which wide-field imaging in fluorescence mode will be performed. The clinician
      will then select up to 2 additional sites for biopsy based on the appearance of this
      wide-field fluorescence image, recording the location of each. The high-resolution
      microendoscope will then be used to acquire images at all sites selected for biopsy, followed
      by collection of biopsy specimens.

      The entire imaging procedure should add less than 10 minutes to the standard colposcopy
      procedure.

    <measure>Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve for Classifying Cervical Tissue into One of 2 Diagnostic Categories</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Data used to develop an algorithm to maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for classifying tissue into one of 2 diagnostic categories (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; normal or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions). Descriptive statistics used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients by diagnostic category. Descriptive statistics and boxplots used to summarize nuclear size and N/C by diagnostic category. Logistic regression methods used with the training set to model the logit of the probability of being classified as a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and to identify the parameters and threshold values which maximize the area under the ROC curve.</description>
