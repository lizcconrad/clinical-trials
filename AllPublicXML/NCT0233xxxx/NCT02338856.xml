          -  Findings within the range of clinical acceptability in medical history and physical
             examination, and laboratory results within the laboratory reference ranges for the
             relevant laboratory tests (unless the investigator considers the deviation to be
             irrelevant for the purpose of the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject with history of allergies including drug allergies (aspirin, antibiotics,

             pressure (DBP) ≤ 40 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg or pulse rate (PR) ≥ 100 /min after at least 5
             min sitting

          -  A subject with history of drug abuse

          -  A subject who has taken any prescribed medication or herbal compounds within 14 days
             prior to the study drug administration. In addition, a subject who has taken any
             over-the-counter drug or vitamin supplements within 7 days prior to the study drug
             administration (However, investigators can judge the subject, who has taken the
             medications during those periods above, eligible for the trial if all other conditions
             are satisfied.)

          -  A subject who has participated in any other clinical trial either for investigational
             or marketed drugs within 8 weeks before the study drug administration
