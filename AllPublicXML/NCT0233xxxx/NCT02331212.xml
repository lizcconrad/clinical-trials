    <textblock>
      This research trial studies the role of a substance called hyaluronic acid in causing the
      growth of cancer stem cells in the bones of patients with breast cancer. Cancer stem cells
      are a type of cancer cells that may cause the cancer to spread to other parts of the body.
      Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients and animal models in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about whether hyaluronic acid affects the growth of cancer in the
      bones.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the hypothesis that there are more hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2)+ cells in
      patients with bone metastasis compared to patients with only local disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the hypothesis that cells with HAS2+ and cancer stem cell (CSC)+ (cluster of
      differentiation [CD]24-/CD44+/epithelial specific antigen [ESA]+) cells will have the most
      aggressive growth in the bone, using an animal model.

      OUTLINE:

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected and analyzed via flow cytometry and polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). Cells are also transplanted into mice and studied.

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be generated. The relationship of each cell's bone metastatic ability and HAS2 expression will be examined using correlations within each group between these two measures. The mean values of the HAS2 expression and bone metastatic ability will be compared between groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models. In addition, 2-sample t-tests will be used to compare the primary cancer and bone metastases groups.</description>

    <description>Expression of CSC markers including CD24, CD44 and ESA will be examined. These will also be examined using descriptive statistics and compared with each other using one-way ANOVA models and 2-sample t-tests to compare the primary cancer and bone metastases groups.</description>
