      The purpose of this prospective observational study is to understand the relationship between
      paclitaxel exposure and development of peripheral neuropathy during treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in various tumor types. Paclitaxel
      efficacy and toxicity are &quot;dose-dependent&quot; meaning that increasing the dose increases
      treatment efficacy and occurrence of toxicity. When used in the weekly 1-hour infusion
      regimen paclitaxel is commonly associated with treatment-limiting sensory peripheral
      neuropathy. At the current standard dose of 80 mg/m2 approximately 20-25% of patients
      experience treatment-limiting neuropathy.

      Drug exposure, not dose, determines treatment efficacy and neuropathy development. When
      treated with standard doses there is substantial variability in drug exposure meaning some
      patients are receiving less efficacious treatment than optimal. At this time we do not
      monitor a patient's exposure because the optimal exposure level has not been defined. The
      purpose of this study is to prospectively enroll patients for systematic collection of
      exposure and neuropathy data in order to characterize this relationship. Once the
      relationship between cumulative exposure and neuropathy has been characterized, this model
      will be used to define an exposure target in future prospective exposure-guided
      dose-adjustment trials.
