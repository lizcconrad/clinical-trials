             complete the study as planned.

          -  Subject is in good health as deemed by the investigator, based on the findings of a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests,
             and ECG.

          -  Male or female, 18-60 years of age for HV and 18-65 years of age for subjects with

             subjects with CHC. The minimum weight is 50 kg in both populations. No more than 25%
             of patients in any cohort may be enrolled with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.

             childbearing potential (defined as females with a documented tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's
             reference range for postmenopausal females). A post-menopausal female receiving
             hormone replacement therapy who is willing to discontinue hormone therapy 28 days
             before study drug dosing and agrees to remain off hormone replacement therapy for the

          1. Clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal,
             hematologic, neurologic, thyroid, or any other medical illness or psychiatric
             disorder, as determined by the Investigator and/or Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

          2. Positive test for HAV IgM, HBsAg, or HIV Ab. In Parts 1 and 2 positive HCV serology is
             exclusionary.

          3. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the study's
             objectives or the well-being of the subject or prevent the subject from meeting the
             study requirements.

          4. Participation in an investigational drug trial or having received an investigational
             vaccine within 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to study
             medication.

             history of prolonged QT syndrome (e.g., torsade de pointes) or sudden cardiac death;
             or a corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds for male subjects and &gt;470
             milliseconds for female subjects at the Screening Visit.

          6. Clinically significant blood loss or elective blood donation of significant volume
             (i.e., &gt; 500 mL) within 60 days of first dose of study drug; &gt; 1 unit of plasma within
             7 days of first dose of study drug.

          7. Abnormal heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature or blood pressure values outside of
             the normal range (evaluated in a semi-recumbent or recumbent position after 5 minutes
             of rest). One repeat measurement after an additional 5 minutes of rest is permitted.

          8. Evidence of active infection (other than CHC infection in subjects enrolled in Part
             3).

          9. Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to the start of dosing through
             the study completion visit.

         10. History of regular alcohol intake &gt; 7 units per week of alcohol for females and &gt; 14
             units per week for males (one unit is defined as 10 g alcohol) within 3 months of
             screening visit.

             screened for includes amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids,
             phencyclidine (PCP) and benzodiazepines. Subjects with CHC may be included if they
             have a positive result for cannabinoids at screening. However, they must be willing to
             abstain from cannabinoid use throughout the duration of the study.

         13. In Parts 1-2, the use of concomitant medications, including prescription, over the
             counter medications, or herbal medications within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication is excluded, unless approved by the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. PRN
             use of a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) is permitted.

             CYP450 enzymes within 2 weeks prior to study drug dosing (Appendix C).

             first dosing day.

         17. Abnormal biochemistry or hematology laboratory results obtained at screening. Elevated
             bilirubin in subjects with suspected Gilbert's disease is allowed.

             Additional exclusion criteria for subjects with CHC infection:

         18. History of clinical hepatic decompensation, e.g., variceal bleeding, spontaneous
             bacterial peritonitis, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or active jaundice

         19. Liver biopsy within two years or Fibroscan evaluation within 6 months prior to
             randomization that demonstrates cirrhosis (Knodell score &gt;3, Metavir score &gt; 3, Ishak
             score &gt; 4). Fibroscan liver stiffness score &gt; 10.5 kPa.
