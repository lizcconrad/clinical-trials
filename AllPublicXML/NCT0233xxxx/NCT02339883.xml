      Background:

      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) creates high-quality images of the human body without
      x-rays. It uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures. Researchers want to
      test a scanner that uses a high magnetic field strength.

      Objective:

      - To study how the body responds to being in a high field 11.7T MRI scanner.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy people ages 22 65.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will
           complete a healthy volunteer questionnaire and an MRI safety screening form. They may
           have a 3T MRI scan of the brain.

        -  Participants will have an MRI scan. They will lie on a table that will slide in and out
           of the MRI cylinder very slowly. They will be asked to lie still.

        -  Participants will do simple tasks while inside the machine. These can include listening
           and responding to questions, tapping fingers, or moving a hand.

        -  While in the scanner, participants will hear loud knocking noises. They will get
           earmuffs.

        -  Right when they exit the scanner, participants will get a questionnaire to fill out.
           This will ask about how they felt inside the scanner.

        -  During the MRI, participants heart rate, respiratory rate, and skin temperature will be
           measured. Before and after the scan, these things plus blood pressure will be measured.

        -  Participants will be tested before and after being in the MRI scanner. They will answer
           questions, take pen-and-paper or computer tests, and do simple actions. Their sense of
           smell may be tested.

      Objective

      The goals of this pilot study are to establish a normative database of vital signs, cognitive
      function and unusual subjective sensations in a 0T scanner. This data will be used as a
      reference for a future study of the effects of exposure to a 11.7T static magnetic field.

      Study Population

      26 healthy volunteers, aged 22-65.

      Accrual ceiling =50

      Accrual Target =26

      Drop outs will be replaced

      Design

      The study consists of one outpatient screening session and one experimental session. Informed
      consent and a history and neurological examination will be carried out at the screening
      visit. Vital signs (pulse oximeter, heart rate, respiratory rate and skin temperature) will
      be measured immediately before and after the experimental scan session, and pulse oximeter,
      heart rate and respiration will be monitored when the subject is in the scanner. Subjects
      will remain in the scanner for approximately 1 hour. During the experimental session, while
      the subject is in the scanner, they will be asked to carry out a brief test of attention at
      10-15 minute intervals, up to 3 times during the session. At the end of the experimental
      session, subjects will fill out the MRI exit questionnaire to rate subjective sensations such
      as nausea, vertigo, and lightheadedness, on a Likert scale and complete a computerized
      neuro-cognitive test battery.

      Outcome Measures

      The objective of the study is to obtain a normative dataset of neuropsychological test
      measures, physiological parameters, and subjective experiences measures in subjects
      undergoing 0T exposure.
