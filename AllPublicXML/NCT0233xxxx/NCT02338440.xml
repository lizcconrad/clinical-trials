    <textblock>
      Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the
      major complication. VOD occurs in 11-31% of pediatric HSCT and the mortality reaches up to
      50%.

      Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) have been reported to prevent and relieve the severity of VOD by
      Gluckman et al.. Lipo-PGE1 is a transporter of PGE1, which is superior in concentrating PGE1
      and acts for prolonged time. Because of the prolonged effective time, lipo-PGE1 acts
      comparable effects by 1/4~1/8 of PGE1 dose. Empirically, pediatric HSCT centers adopt
      lipo-PGE1 in dose of 1 mcg/kg/day (0.042 mcg/kg/hr), which is 1/7 of the dose recommended by
      Gluckman, et al. This prospective study will investigate the concentration of lipo-PGE1 with
      preventive lipo-PGE1 with empirical dose (1 mcg/kg/day).

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lipo-PGE1. Secondary objective: To
      evaluate the relation between lipo-PGE1 concentration and VOD occurrence, severity.

      Inclusion criteria

        1. Patients undergoing HSCT with high risk of VOD who cannot use low dose heparin.

             -  high risk of VOD : previous radiotherapy, liver function abnormality, children,
                conditioning regimen including busulfan or total body irradiation

             -  contraindication of heparin : low platelet count, bleeding tendency, allergy

        2. Patients (or one of parents if patients age &lt; 19) should sign informed consent.

      Exclusion criteria

        1. Patient with heart failure.

        2. Patient with bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract bleeding,
           hemoptysis).

        3. History of hypersensitivity reaction as shock to lipo-PGE1.

        4. Psychiatric disorder that would preclude compliance.

        5. If the clinician decides that there is a condition improper for the clinical study.
