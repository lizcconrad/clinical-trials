  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced tumour, neoadjuvant treatment has been proposed in various
      modalities as a way to decrease size and downstage the tumour leading to a re-sectable
      disease. The HybridTherm probe (HTP), (ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) com-bines
      bipolar RF-ablation with cryogenic induced cooling. It is well known that a bipolar
      radiofrequency system creates ablation with less collateral thermal damage than standard
      monopolar systems but with the trade-off to lose overall efficiency.

    <description>To demonstrate the efficacy of the HybridTherm probe in the control of the tumour progression in terms of progression-free survival, measured at 6-month after ther-apy onset (PFS-6). PFS-6 takes in consideration the tumor growth in relation to the volume/size evaluated as a difference between the previous and the current examination. In practice, it is the time interval between the enrolment of the patient and the first radiological evidence of tumor progression.
For patients who were resected (R0 and R1) the PFS is the time until the first radio-logical evidence of tumor recurrence, regardless size.
For not resected patients the PFS is the time until the first radiological evidence of a growth of the lesion &gt; 20% in comparison to the previous exam.</description>

    <description>The procedures will be performed in the Endoscopic Room. Patients will be sedated by the anaesthesiologist. Device settings and application times will be set and recorded on a computer that will analyze the changes of the properties of the tissue.
The setting of the maximal application time will be based on the results of the described ex-vivo and in-vivo studies and will be adjusted to the size of the tumour. This ensures a reduction of HybridTherm related complications which may occur if the applica-tion time would not be limited. The application of Power Doppler will make the procedure safer.
The probe will be guided under real time EUS into the tumour. The success of the placement of the HTP into the tumour will be an index of the feasibility of the treatment. The system will analyse the effects on the tissue, and EUS will record the changes of the tissues, the growing edema around the treated area, and tissue devita-lisation, with attention to the complications.</description>
