  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate that the onset of the antiplatelet effect of 90mg bid
      dose ticagrelor is more rapid and greater than 75 mg qd dose clopidogrel in patients
      undergoing CABG surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing coronary artery surgery routinely receive aspirin therapy, as a standard
      treatment for preserving bypass graft patency. Although the dual antiplatelet therapy post
      CABG has not been recommended by guideline, present studies indicated the patients could
      benefit from the dual anti-platelet therapy. Using clopidogrel+aspirin could significantly
      reduce the early saphenous vein graft occlusion. . Many surgeons empirically prescribe dual
      anti-platelet therapy in spite of the indeterminacy of the clinical effects. ticagrelor is a
      novel, reversibly binding, oral, direct-acting P2Y12-receptor antagonist. The ONSET/OFFSET
      Study also shows that ticagrelor achieved much rapid and greater platelet inhibition than
      high-loading-dose clopidogrel in patients with stable CAD. ticagrelor is a novel, reversibly
      binding, oral, direct-acting P2Y12-receptor antagonist. The ONSET/OFFSET Study also shows

      clopidogrel in patients with stable CAD.
