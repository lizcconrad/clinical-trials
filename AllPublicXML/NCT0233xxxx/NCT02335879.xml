      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Domestic Recombinant
      Human Follitropin (Gonal-F) for Injection for treatment of WHO Ⅱ anovulation (including
      polycystic ovarian syndrome [PCOS] subjects).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Married infertile women at the age of 21-38.

          -  BMI&lt;28kg/m2.

          -  According to the detection level of serum estradiol (E2), prolactin (PRL),
             progesterone (P), testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH), subjects were diagnosed of WHO class II anovulation or oligo-ovulation,
             and the above hormone level of the subject is normal or normal after treatment at the
             beginning of study, and FSH&lt;10IU/L.

          -  Bilateral fallopian tubes are unobstructed proved by hysterosalpingograph or
             laparoscopic examination within one year, no history of abortion or pelvic infection
             after the examination, the researcher decide whether the above examination need to
             repeat. If the subject had salpingoplasty under laparoscope, and the bilateral
             fallopian tubes are unobstructed after the surgery, there is no need to have the
             hysterosalpingograph. If it can not be confirmed, it must be done again to prove that
             the bilateral fallopian tubes are unobstructed.

          -  Vaginal B-ultrasound examination shows that there is no ovarian pathological tumor, no
             hysteromyoma or hysteromyoma&lt;4cm, and does not affect the endometrial function.

          -  Two examinations of spouse semen are normal within six months, or comply with the IUI
             standard.

          -  No history of drug abuse.

          -  Voluntarily sign the informed consent form and agree with medication and accepting
             evaluation according to the requirements of the research protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject use gonadotropin therapy within the past three months (regardless the
             result of treatment).

          -  The uterine factors affect pregnancy and other tumors.

          -  Pregnancy contraindication, such as genetic diseases, mental diseases, drug abuse,
             sexually transmitted diseases, severe heart disease and hepatic and kidney function
             insufficiency.

          -  Obscure vaginal bleeding.

          -  Subjects are allergic to the application of FSH/HMG and HCG in the past.

          -  Other conditions that the researchers think they are not suitable for the clinical
             trials.
