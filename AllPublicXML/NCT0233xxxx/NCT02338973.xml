      Background:

      - People with rod-cone dystrophy (RCD) or enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) have excess fluid
      under the retina of their eye. This can cause vision loss. The medicine interferon gamma-1b
      may help people with these diseases.

      Objectives:

      - To see if interferon gamma-1b eyedrops are safe for people with RCD or ESCS. To see if the
      medicine can decrease retina fluid and help prevent vision loss.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 12 years old with RCD or ESCS. Those with ESCS must have two mutations in
      the NR2E3 gene.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, eye exam, and blood
           tests.

        -  Participants will stay at NIH for 2 days and get the first eyedrops.

        -  Participants will give themselves 4 study eyedrops 4 times daily for 2 weeks and keep a
           diary.

        -  Participants will have 2 phone calls and 5 outpatient visits over 8 weeks. They may
           have:

        -  Repeats of screening tests.

        -  Questionnaires.

        -  Small piece of skin removed.

        -  Eye exams, including eye dilation and tasks on computer screens.

        -  Fluorescein angiography. A dye injected into an arm vein will travel to the blood
           vessels in the eyes. A camera will take pictures.

        -  Electroretinography. Participants will sit in the dark wearing eyepatches. A small
           electrode will be taped to the forehead. After 30 minutes, researchers will remove the
           eyepatches and put in numbing eyedrops and contact lenses. Participants will watch
           flashing lights.

        -  Electrooculography. Electrodes will be attached outside of the eyes and eye function
           will be measured in the dark and the light.

        -  Participants will have a follow-up visit after 52 weeks.

      Objective:

      Rod-cone dystrophy (RCD) is a term applied to a number of genetically heterogenous diseases
      presenting with night vision abnormalities, visual field defects and reduced rod
      electroretinography responses. Enhanced S-Cone syndrome (ESCS) is a rare autosomal recessive
      retinal disease with a developmental and a degenerative aspect. Macular cystic changes, often
      florid and usually resulting in a reduction of central acuity, are frequently associated with
      both diseases. The reason for this association is not well understood. Acetazolamide (Diamox)
      and Dorzolamide (Trusopt) have been reported to have variable success in reducing these
      cystic changes but the effect is frequently inadequate. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Interferon (IFN) gamma-1b administered
      topically for macular edema/retinal schisis cysts in RCD and ESCS. Possible disease-related
      pathophysiologic mechanisms will be explored using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
      protocols leading to iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor
      generation.

      Study Population:

      Up to five participants with RCD with significant macular cystic changes and up to five
      participants with ESCS with significant macular cystic changes will be enrolled to receive
      IFN gamma-1b administered topically in one eye. However, up to an additional two participants
      may be enrolled in order to obtain the five participants in each disease group to be included
      in the primary analysis if any participants withdraw from the study prior to receiving five
      days of treatment.

      Design:

      This is a single-center, prospective, uncontrolled, unmasked pilot Phase I/II study of the
      safety, tolerability and possible efficacy of IFN gamma-1b in participants with RCD and ESCS
      and macular cystic changes. One eye of up to five participants with RCD with significant
      macular cystic changes and up to five participants with ESCS with significant macular cystic
      changes [evidenced by optical coherence tomography (OCT) &gt;275 microns central macular
      thickness and/or disruption of foveal contour] will receive topical IFN gamma-1b instilled as
      drops on the cornea. The initial stage of the study will include two participants from each
      disease category. Once all four participants have completed the 8-week visit, enrollment will
      be halted. Safety Adverse Event Review Committee members unaffiliated with the study will
      review the data as a preliminary assessment of safety and efficacy and to determine whether
      enrollment should continue. If the committee determines enrollment will continue, three
      additional participants with RCD and three participants with ESCS will be enrolled. The study
      will be completed once the final participant has received one year of follow-up.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measure related to the safety and tolerability of IFN gamma-1b
      administered topically at the prescribed dosage for macular cystic changes in participants
      with RCD and ESCS will be assessed by the number and severity of adverse events related to
      the IP and the number of withdrawals at 52 weeks (one year) post-administration. Additional
      safety of IFN gamma-1b administered topically in participants with RCD and ESCS will be
      determined from the assessment of retinal function, ocular structure and occurrence of
      adverse events at all time points. Secondary outcomes include changes in visual function
      including visual acuity and microperimetry, and retinal imaging with OCT and fluorescein
      angiography.

             completely abstinent from intercourse or must agree to practice two reliable methods
             of contraception while taking the IP and six weeks after completion. Acceptable
             methods of contraception include:

               -  Hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal
                  patch or vaginal ring);

               -  Intrauterine device;

               -  Barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide; or

               -  Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.

          1. Participant has a history of other ocular disease likely to contribute significantly
             to visual disruption (e.g., optic neuropathy, glaucoma, uveitis, or other retinal
             disease).

          2. Participant has had diagnosis or treatment of a malignancy (excluding non-melanoma
             skin cancer) within the previous five years.

          3. Participant has received investigational treatment in another clinical study related
             to an ocular condition in the last six months.

          4. Participant is pregnant, lactating, planning to become pregnant (or father a child)

          5. Participant is allergic to fluorescein dye.

          6. Participant has a systemic condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude participation in the study (e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), as IFN gamma may
             cause MS exacerbations).

        Study Eye Eligibility Criteria

        A participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the
        exclusion criteria listed below.

        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria

          1. The study eye must retain adequate fixation to allow for completion of protocol
             assessments.

          2. The study eye must have macular cystic changes (&gt;275 microns and/or disruption of
             foveal contour on OCT).

        Study Eye Exclusion Criteria

          1. The study eye has lens, cornea, or other media opacities that preclude adequate
             visualization and testing of the retina.

          2. The study eye has undergone intraocular surgery within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          3. The study eye has a disease that may confound the outcome of the study [e.g.,
             choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the fovea or parafoveal area].

          4. Participant is unwilling to discontinue wearing a contact lens in the study eye during
             IP administration.

        Study Eye Selection Criteria in Cases of Bilateral Disease

        RCD and ESCS usually affect both eyes to a similar degree. In case both eyes of a
        participant meet the study eye eligibility criteria, the following criteria will be used to
        select the study eye:

          -  The eye with more intraretinal fluid will be selected as the study eye;

          -  If both eyes have similar levels of intraretinal fluid, the eye with worse visual
             acuity will be selected as the study eye;

          -  If both eyes have the similar levels of intraretinal fluid and visual acuities, the
             right eye will be selected as the study eye.
