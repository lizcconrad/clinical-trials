  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal study is to provide prospective evidence that the
      SentiMag®/SiennaXP® is safe and non-inferior to the current standard of care for lymph node
      localization in patients with breast cancer as part of a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
      procedure and to summarize measures of product safety and performance.

      This is a pivotal, prospective, open label, multicenter, paired comparison of the SentiMag®
      and SiennaXP® magnetic sentinel node localization system with the standard of care
      (radioisotope with blue dye) for lymph node localization in the detection of lymph nodes in
      patients with breast cancer undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy. The trial is designed to
      provide powered evidence that the lymph node detection rate of the SentiMag® and SiennaXP®
      system is non-inferior to the standard of care in patients with breast cancer.
