      Phase II only will enroll the following patients:

      Patients with metastatic sarcoma to be enrolled in the following 4 arms: pembro plus
      gemcitabine, pembro plus gemcitabine and docetaxel, pembro plus gemcitabine and vinorelbine,
      and pembro plus liposomal doxorubicin.

      Patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to be enrolled in the pembro plus
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel arm.

      Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer to be enrolled in the pembro plus
      irinotecan arm.

      Patients with ER+ breast cancer to be enrolled in the pembro and vinorelbine arm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Patient at least 18 years old and has definitive histologically or cytologically
        confirmed metastatic solid tumor 2. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable by
        CT scan (or PET/CT, if patient is allergic to CT contrast media) 3. The investigator will
        select the appropriate treatment arm for the patient with the following requirements: (a)
        Patients cannot have had prior progression or intolerance on the single agent chemotherapy
        and then enrolled on an arm with that same single agent chemotherapy plus pembro (b) The
        chemotherapy on the arm selected must be considered standard of care or listed in the NCCN
        guidelines (www.nccn.org) for that cancer type 4. Have recovered from acute toxicities of
        prior treatment:

          1. &gt; 3 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any investigational agent

          2. &gt; 2 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any radiotherapy, or ≥ 3 weeks or 5
             half-lives whichever is shorter for treatment with cytotoxic or biologic agents (≥ 6
             weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas). Chronic treatment with non-investigational
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs or other hormonal or supportive care is
             permitted 5. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the
             following blood counts at time of screening: 6. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500
             mm3, platelet count ≥ 100×109 L, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 7. Serum creatinine ≤2.0, total
             bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) range (except:
             for the nab-paclitaxel containing arm, bilirubin ≤ 1.25 times the ULN and for the
             docetaxel containing arm, bilirubin must be within institutional normal limits and
             AST/ALT ≤ 1.5 times the ULN) 8. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional
             normal limits. If TSH is above the upper limit of normal range, then a free T4 within
             institutional normal limits is acceptable 9. Persistent prior systemic therapy
             non-hematologic AE grade ≥ 2 (except alopecia or correctable electrolyte abnormality

               2. Patients must have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to be enrolled in the
                  pembro plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel arm

               3. Patients must have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer to be enrolled in the
                  pembro plus irinotecan arm
