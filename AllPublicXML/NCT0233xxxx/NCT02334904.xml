  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant changes in brain morphology are observed in people with first-episode psychosis.
      Studies have shown that total brain volume and particular brain structures are decreased in
      people with psychosis disorders. Recent evidence suggests that some atypical antipsychotic
      drugs can maintain or increase brain volumes. Thus, we plan to use MRI scans to measure
      changes in brain morphology in subjects recently diagnosed with bipolar or psychosis
      disorders who are taking the atypical antipsychotic drugs aripiprazole or risperidone.
      Secondary objectives include taking blood samples for fasting metabolic indices and
      neuropsychiatric measures for comparisons between drug treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a direct measure of brain volume and matter (by means of
      MRI) to determine if there is a differential effect between aripiprazole and risperidone on
      brain morphology in participants with first-episode psychosis. A secondary objective is to
      see if fasting metabolic indices measured in the blood (i.e. glucose, insulin, total
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin and leptin) are
      also correlated to changes in brain morphology or symptom severity (as measured by
      neuropsychiatric assessments).

      Participants will be offered the option of taking part in an optional biobanking component of
      the main study. Eight milliliters of whole blood samples will be collected and stored at -80
      degrees Celsius for genotyping to determine if certain genetic polymorphisms predispose
      individuals to brain changes while taking antipsychotic medications.
