    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        DLI Recipient

          -  Relapsed AML or ALL ≥ 60 days after allogeneic SCT.

          -  Evidence of residual donor chimerism on most recent analysis (within 4 weeks of
             enrollment).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age,

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%.

          -  Absence of active GVHD and off immunosuppression. Subjects on tapering prednisone will
             be eligible if their dose is 0.25 mg/kg or less and being actively tapered. We suggest
             a 28 day waiting period off of immunosuppression but some subjects with rapidly
             progressive disease may need to be treated before 30 days and will still be eligible.

          -  Adequate organ function: Cr ≤ 2 mg/dL; ALT/AST &lt; 3x ULN, direct bili &lt;3x ULN.

          -  Matched sibling or un-related donor (A, B, C, and DR) available to undergo
             leukopheresis.

          -  Subjects must be able to sign consent and be willing and able to comply with scheduled
             visits, treatment plan and laboratory testing.

          -  Willing to provide blood samples for research purposes.

          -  Willing to adhere to medically accepted form of birth control to prevent pregnancy
             (includes: complete abstention from intercourse, condoms, diaphragms, cervical cap,
             intra-uterine device, history of surgical sterility - tubal ligation or vasectomy in
             patient or partner, or oral contraceptive).

        DLI Donor

          1. HLA identical to recipient subject.

          2. Considered medically eligible for leukopheresis procedure by independent donor
             physician (University of Pennsylvania physician who is not the recipient's primary
             transplant physician for related donors; physician designated by National Marrow Donor
             Program for unrelated donors).

          3. Considered medically eligible to receive G-CSF (filgrastim) by independent donor
             physician.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Recipient

          -  Prior cell therapy for relapse within the past 90 days.

          -  Requirement for active immunosuppression to treat GVHD.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children and effects
             on breast milk are not known.

          -  Uncontrolled active infection

          -  Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as
             outlined.

        Donor

        - Unable to participate in a leukopheresis procedure or receive G-CSF (filgrastim).
