      To investigate the efficacy of Zoledronic acid and placebo treatment on the prosthetic
      transverse translation in post-menopausal osteoporosis women under cementless total hip
      arthroplasty by Radiostereometry （RSA）in two-year follow-up period .

      Meanwhile to assess efficacy of Zoledronic acid treatment on the vertical translation of
      acetabulum and the subsidence translation of femoral stem by Radiostereometry（RSA),
      prevention of peri- prosthetic bone loss by observing the local average bone mineral density
      ( BMD ) changes for 7 femoral region Gruen zones through Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry
      (DXA）scans, et al.
