  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain represents one of the most common symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that can seriously
      affect patient health-related quality of life.

      Central neuropathic pain, the main form of pain in MS patients, represents a significant
      clinical problem, in consideration of its poorly responsiveness to available therapies.

      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, well-tolerated procedure with an high
      and well documented neuromodulation activity at Central Nervous System (CNS) level. First
      evidences obtained by animal, neurophysiological and clinical studies suggested its potential
      efficacy in neuropathic pain treatment.

      In particular spinal DCS (sDCS) has been proven to modulate Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex
      (NWR), an objective and sensitive tool to explore pain processing at the Spinal Level and
      recommended by European Federation of Neurological Society (EFNS) to evaluate the analgesic
      effect of treatments. In this order of view the investigators' objective is to investigate
      sDCS efficacy in MS neurophatic pain treatment applying validated clinical scales,
      neurophysiological acquisitions and specific biological marker dosages.

      The investigators plan to recruit, at the IRCCS Neurological National Institute C. Mondino,
      60 consecutive patients with definite Multiple Sclerosis (MS) according to 2005 McDonald
      criteria in a follow-up procedure that includes a general and neurological evaluation scored
      according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale of Kurtzke and its functional systems.

      Relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary-progressive (SP) and primary-progressive (PP) MS
      patients, affecting by neuropathic or nociceptive chronic pain conditions in accord to 1994
      International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)classification, will be recruited.
      Patients complaining any form of headache will be excluded by the study. The investigators
      will excluded also patients with cognitive impairment (Minimental State Examination - MMSE-
      &lt;= 21) and psychiatry diseases, in particular depression (Back Depression Inventory Scale -
      BDI - &gt;15).

      Characteristic and intensity of pain symptoms will be collected respectively with validated
      Italian version of Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory Scale (NPSI) and Numerical Rating
      Scale (NRS). Spasticity of lower legs, if present, will be clinical assessed with Ashworth
      Scale and Neurophysiologically evaluated with H/M ratio and Vibratory Inhibition of H-Reflex.

      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be assessed by means of the Medical Outcome
      36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) whereas the presence and severity of fatigue will be
      assessed by means of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).

      RR patients will be evaluated in stationary phase of the disease that is at least two months
      after the last clinical relapse and at least one month after the end of a steroidal
      treatment.

      Patients will be consecutive enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to two group: 1.
      Sham and 2. Anodal Spinal Direct Current Stimulation Treatment, in a double-blind, placebo
      controlled study design.

      Before enrollment, the study protocol will be explained to each subject, and informed written
      consent will be obtained.

      The investigators will proceed as follow:

        1. Time of enrollment - T0 First Day

             -  Complete clinical evaluation with administration of MMSE and BDI for exclusion

                stimulation to investigate the somatosensory pathway involvement.

             -  Clinical and Neurophysiological evaluation of Spasticity (if present): Ashworth
                Scale and H/M ratio and HReflex Vibratory Inhibition.

                Temporal Summation (see 'Neurophysiological Acquisition' Session for details)
                before and after 30 and 60 minutes the first sDCS treatment

        2. sDCS Treatment After evaluation at T0 patients will undergo 10 daily sDCS treatment, 5
           days a week (see sDCS treatment session for details).

        3. Evaluation after 10 days of treatment - T1

             -  Administration of NPSI, SF-36, HRQoL e FESS

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The endocannabinoid system is involved in descending central pain control and can be modulated by other neurostimulation techniques as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The investigators suppose that one of the major effect of sDCS is to modulate supraspinal central pain control through activation of endocannabinoid system inducing the analgesic effect. Alteration of endocannabinoid system activity is also involved in other pathological aspects of Multiple Sclerosis as spasms, spasticity and incontinence and to acute and chronic neurodegeneration (anti-oxidant activity and inhibition of glutamate release and signalling). Activity of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) in platelets will be quantify.</description>

    <measure>Spasticity as determined by Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>As sDCS reduces NWR area and as it may modulate endocannabinoid system, the investigators could suppose other positive effects of this treatment in Multiple Sclerosis patients as reduction of painful spasms and spasticity. The investigators will evaluate the effect of sDCS on spasticity, if present, investigating its effect on validate ad hoc scales (Ashworth scale) and on neurophysiological acquisitions (H reflex).</description>
