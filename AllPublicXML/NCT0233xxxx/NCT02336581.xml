      To test the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) versus enhanced
      Treatment as Usual (eTAU) delivered by hospital staff for inpatients with psychotic-spectrum
      disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with psychotic disorders frequently require treatment at inpatient hospital settings
      during periods of acute illness for crisis management and stabilization. Although these
      patients often receive efficacious pharmacotherapy, there is a recognized lack of
      empirically-supported psychosocial interventions provided to patients in typical hospital
      settings. The provision of high quality psychosocial treatment during hospitalization is
      challenging due to short lengths of stay and a general lack of trained therapist employed on
      hospital units who can provide these evidence-based therapies. This unmet need for hospital
      psychosocial treatment represents a crucial missed opportunity to teach patients coping
      strategies that can speed time to recovery and impact post-discharge risk factors. Acceptance
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a newer cognitive-behavioral approach that combines
      innovative mindfulness-based strategies for helping patients to cope more successfully with
      psychotic and other symptoms and implement values-consistent behavioral goals. However,
      adaptations to the original ACT approach are urgently needed to foster widespread
      implementation in community settings. The aim of the current study is to adapt the only
      promising acute-care psychosocial treatment for psychosis to be implementable in an inpatient
      setting and pilot test its effectiveness.
