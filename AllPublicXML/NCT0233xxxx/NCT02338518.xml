  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is an important therapeutic method for unresectable gastric cancer patients.
      However, there is currently no established standard chemotherapeutic regimen for gastric
      cancer. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity between SEEOX and SOX
      regimens. The investigators estimate that combined intravenous and intra-arterial intensified
      SEEOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be a safe and promising regimen in unresectable gastric
      cancer patients.

      Gastric cancer patients who will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy would be included in this
      study. They would receive combined intravenous and intra-arterial intensified SEEOX
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy or SOX regimen at random. The efficacy and toxicity of these two
      regimens would be compared.

    <description>A three-cycle neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was performed in all cases. In every cycle, oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2, etoposide 80 mg/m2, and pharmorubicin 30 mg/m2 were administered from the celiac artery on day 1. 80 mg of oral S-1 per square meter of body-surface area per day was given for 2 weeks. The second cycle was scheduled following a 1-week rest after the first cycle.</description>
