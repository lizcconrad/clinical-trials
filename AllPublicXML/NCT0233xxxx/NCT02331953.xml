  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is an important problem in patients undergoing major surgery. The
      incidence of delirium was 12.5% in the patients over 70 years old undergoing spine surgery. A
      study shows that a low preoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) is associated
      with postoperative delirium after on-pump cardiac surgery. This same perturbation likely also
      increases the risk for postoperative delirium after spine surgery, although there are little
      data that have evaluated this hypothesis. Therefore, this observational study was designed to
      explore the relationship between perioperative rSO2 and the delirium in elderly patients
      undergoing spine surgery.

    <description>The presence and severity of delirium were assessed with Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) once a day. (1 day preopertive, 2 days postoperative.) The investigators plan to evaluate whether periopertive rSO2 can predict postoperative delirium in elder patients after spine surgery and to assess the predictive power of periopertiver rSO2 regarding postoperative delirium. Perioperative rSO2 was observed during surgery (an expected average of 2~3 hours).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in the study will be 60 or older undergoing elective major spine surgery
             (expected operative time is more than 2 hrs).

          2. Patients who can do the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Confusion Assessment
             Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC).

          3. Patients who understand the nature of the study and are willing to sign the consent
             form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Emergency surgery

          2. Patients diagnosed with neurocognitive disorders or psychiatric diseases, thus, cannot
             check MMSE or communicate with other people (e.g. Alzheimer's dementia, alcohol abuse)

          3. Patients diagnosed with cerebrovascular disorders (e.g. stroke, atherosclerotic
             stenosis of carotid artery, TIA)

          4. Patients who cannot be followed up until 2 days after surgery
