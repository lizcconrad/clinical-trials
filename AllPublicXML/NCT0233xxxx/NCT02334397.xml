  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operative vaginal delivery (with forceps or vacuums) is frequently performed secondary to
      maternal exhaustion, which leads to an inability to push effectively; 40% of operative
      vaginal deliveries at Prentice are for maternal exhaustion. The risk of severe birth trauma
      is increased three to four fold with operative delivery. This randomized, controlled trial
      will compare rates of operative vaginal delivery and severe birth trauma in two groups of
      women: (1) an intervention group who will participate in the antepartum Total ControlÂ®
      fitness and education program modified for pregnancy; and (2) a control group. Women will be
      recruited and followed from the second trimester until 6 weeks postpartum; all will complete
      validated questionnaires regarding their (1) level of worry and knowledge about their
      birthing experience (2) pelvic floor symptoms and quality of life (3) sexual function (4)
      satisfaction with their birthing experience and (5) level of depressive symptoms at various
      time points during and after their pregnancy. Obstetrical data will also be collected.

      This will be a randomized controlled trial of primiparous women with singleton pregnancies
      who plan on delivering at Prentice Women's Hospital. Women will be recruited during their
      first trimester by their obstetrician as well as through standardized Northwestern Memorial
      Hospital flyers and ads. Demographic and delivery information will be obtained from the
      Northwestern Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), as well as by the attending midwife or
      physician at the time of delivery using a standardized Delivery Information Form. Women will
      also be asked about their other physical activities (including other forms of daily/weekly
      exercise) as well as whether or not they are participating in other birthing classes at the
      time of their first Total Control class (intervention group) or 2nd trimester visit with
      their providers (controls). All women will wear pedometers to track daily general activity.

    <description>Women will be enrolled in Total Control, which is a fitness and education program. Specifically, Total Control is a comprehensive pelvic fitness and wellness program designed by board-certified female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) practitioners as well as physical therapists that combines pelvic floor and core muscle strengthening. Subjects will participate in 1 standardized class per week during their second trimester for a total of 6 weeks. Women will also participate in a weekly educational session which will include keynote speakers who are experts in various aspects of the labor and delivery process. Women in this group will complete questionnaires and consent to use of their delivery outcomes. Women will also wear pedometers to track daily general activity.</description>
