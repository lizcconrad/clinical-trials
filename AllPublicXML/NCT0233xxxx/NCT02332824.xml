      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy and safety on daily oral doses of
      TAK-272 5 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      microalbuminuria by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison
      in order to determine the clinical dose of TAK-272.

      This is a phase 2 dose-finding study to test the efficacy and safety on daily oral doses of
      TAK-272 5 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      microalbuminuria by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison
      in order to determine the clinical dose of TAK-272. In addition, by defining a candesartan
      cilexetil 8 mg group as a reference group under double-blinded fashion, clinical benefits of
      TAK-272 will be exploratorily determined.

    <description>The frequencies of all adverse events observed during the observation period will be tabulated by type and seriousness, and causal relationship to TAK-272/candesartan cilexetil. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, reported from the first dose to the last dose of TAK-272/candesartan cilexetil. Among these, events which are considered possibly related to TAK-272/candesartan cilexetil are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>
