  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators perform neuropsychological tests and brain scintigraphy in 30 healthy
      subjects.

      These results will be compared with data obtained out of episode in patients with
      Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS).

      The investigators want to determine if brain functional imaging and cognitive abnormalities
      persist during asymptomatic period in a large series of patients with KLS, and to find
      predictors of these abnormalities.

      3 steps in the protocol :

        -  Brain ECD-SPECT (marking brain perfusion in relation to brain active/hypoactive area)
           superimposed on a template T1-weighted brain MRI.

        -  Extensive cognitive tests of executive functions, verbal memory and fluency ,
           visuospatial ability and memory, reasoning abilities: spontaneous memory complaint,
           Stroop Color Word Test, Trail Making Test A and B, Direct and Reverse Digit Span Test,
           Letter and Semantic Fluency Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Rey-Osterrieth
           Complex Figure, Mini-Mental test, Progressive matrice of Raven (PM-38)

        -  KLS-inventory and face to face interview of patients and parents by neurologist for
           patients. Modified KLS-inventory for healthy subjects.

      Main outcome : Number of patients with persisting hypoperfused brain area (compared to
      controls), location of these area, number of patients with at least -1SD in one cognitive
      domain Correlation between KLS severity (disease course, number of episode, mean duration of
      episodes, time incapacitated, number of symptoms) and brain perfusion and cognitive
      abnormalities
