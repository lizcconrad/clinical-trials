      Background:

      - There are more emerging infectious diseases recently. Some could affect many people. Some
      like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are
      caused by new germs. Sometimes known germs suddenly infect new and large areas, like Ebola.
      Many of these diseases don t have good treatments available. Researchers may be able to
      develop a treatment by using antibodies against these infections.

      Objective:

      - To collect antibodies from people with high levels of antibodies to the diseases being
      studied.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy men 18-70 years old who weigh at least 110 pounds. They may have been infected with
      or vaccinated for one of the new infections researchers are studying.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and blood tests. Researchers will
           determine if the participant can have apheresis.

        -  Participants will have apheresis. First, they will be interviewed. Then, a needle will
           be placed in a vein. Blood will be drawn, and a machine will separate the blood cells
           from the antibodies and protein. The blood cells will then be returned to the
           participant through another vein. It takes about 60 minutes for the actual collection.

        -  Participants will be asked to have the procedure at least 3 times. They can participate
           in up to 20 sessions total as part of this study. There must be at least 7 days between
           sessions.

      The administration of convalescent plasma is often used for treatment of emerging infectious
      diseases. This natural history protocol will collect plasma from subjects that were
      vaccinated to or recovered from an emerging infectious disease of interest, in a manner that
      the plasma can be given to other subjects as a therapeutic. Any administration of plasma to
      subjects will be under a separate protocol.
