      To determine Immunogenicity and Safety Study of Modified TRC-ID Regimen with A New
      Chromatographically Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (SPEEDA速) as post exposure rabies
      intradermal regimen with or without Rabies Immunoglobulin in Children

    <textblock>
      post exposure rabies vaccination with modified Thai red cross intrademal regimen has been
      proven to be immunogenic and effection when using purified vero cell vaccine (PVRV) In
      present, new chromatographically purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA), chromatography
      purifed vero cell derived rabies vaccine, is manufactured by the Liaoning Chengda
      Biotechnology is available This study has a goal to determine the immunogenicity of speeda
      when using with post exposure rabies intradermal vaccination with or without rabies immune
      globulin in children
