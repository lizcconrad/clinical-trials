      Purpose: Quantify the relationship between brachial plexus deformations caused by backpack
      carriage and upper extremity performance.

      Significance of expected results:

      The study will allow to quantify the effect of load carriage on both neural and vascular
      function parameters.

      Study plan The effect of nerve strain on neural function: based on the strains obtained for
      each load from computational simulation, and from animal studies published in the literature,
      the expected neural function, (e.g., motor and sensory) dysfunction will be estimated.

      Following signing an informed consent form, 12 young adult subjects (18-35 years) will don a
      military backpack loaded with 25-40 kg. Each volunteer will undergo the following test at
      baseline, following 45 min exposure, and following 15 min of recovery:

        1. Index finger microvascular flow will be measured by photoplethysmography (PPG).

        2. Sensory measurement at the finger; Light touch threshold will be measured by mechanical
           stimulation that will be applied using Von Frey Filaments of the Semmes-Weinstein
           Monofilament (SWM) type.

        3. Forearm thermal sensation threshold; As a measure of sensory function in the forearm,
           cold and warm sensation thresholds will be measured with a computerized quantitative
           thermal sensory device.

           Immediately following the 45 min loading exposure, the fine motor function of the index
           finger will be tested by the following procedures (in an unloaded condition):

        4. Index finger motor function; Force application profile during a trigger press will be
           measured using a force sensor located on a trigger of a dummy weapon simulator. Force
           application rate, peak force, and press-to-press peak force variability will be measured
           based on 10 trigger presses.

        5. Accuracy of force application; Will be evaluated by the simulated shot accuracy,
           horizontal displacement (X) and vertical displacement (Y).

        6. Subjective parameters; in all time points, the volunteers will be asked to rate their
           level of pain sensation intensity (VAS sensory) and degree of unpleasantness (VAS
           affective) in the shoulders and other load bearing sites, as well as ratings of
           perceived exertion (RPE). All subjective parameters will be assessed using visual
           analogue scales.
