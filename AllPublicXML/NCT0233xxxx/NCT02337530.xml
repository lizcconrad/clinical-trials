  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug, selumetinib, has on lung
      cancer when receiving standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see whether selumetinib improves the results of standard
      chemotherapy. The standard or usual treatment for this disease is treatment with chemotherapy
      alone.

        Radiation: Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 4 weeks has
        elapsed between the last dose and enrollment to the trial.

        Chemotherapy and systemic therapy: Prior therapy with ALK inhibitors is permissible.
        Patients may not have received prior MEK inhibitors or any other tyrosine kinase inhibitor

             therapy within the past 2 years

          -  No symptomatic brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Patients with asymptomatic
             brain/spinal cord metastasis who are not planned for radiation, or who have been
             treated and are stable off steroids (or on a decreasing dose) and anticonvulsants are
             eligible.

          -  Patients with significant cardiac disease, including:

          -  any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events
             (e.g. heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long
             QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age) or mean resting
             corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 msec

          -  uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥ 150/95 mmHg despite medical therapy)

             exclusion criteria above, must have a baseline LVEF ≥ 50%.

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, active infection, active
             bleeding diatheses or renal transplant, including any patient known to have hepatitis
             B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Patients who have neuropathy &gt; grade 1 or other conditions precluding treatment with
             the standard chemotherapy regimen planned. Consult CCTG for patients with localised
             neuropathies as such patients may be eligible.

          -  Patients who have significant gastrointestinal disease and who are unable to swallow
             capsules.

          -  Patients on potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 (must have
             discontinued within 2 weeks prior to randomization or 3 weeks for St. John's Wort).
             Patients who do not agree to avoid the ingestion of large amounts of grapefruit and
             Seville oranges (and other products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or
             marmalade) and not take vitamin E supplements or multivitamin supplements.

        Patients who require oral anticoagulants (Coumadin) are eligible provided there is
        increased vigilance with respect to INR monitoring upon initiation of dosing with
        selumetinib. If medically appropriate and treatment available, the investigator should
        consider switching these patients to LMW heparin.

          -  Patients with current or past history of central serous retinopathy or retinal vein
             occlusion, high intraocular pressure (≥ 21mm) or uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective
             of IOP). Patients with visual symptoms should undergo ophthalmologic examination prior
             to randomization.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential must have a urine
             pregnancy test proven negative within 7 days prior to randomization. Men and women of
             childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception

          -  Patients who do not agree to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen
             protection.

          -  Selumetinib-specific precautions for patients of Asian ethnicity:

        Plasma exposure of selumetinib (Cmax and AUC) is higher, at a population level, in subjects
        of Asian descent by approximately 1.5- to 2-fold in non-Japanese Asians and Japanese
        subjects, compared with Western subjects. However, there is overlap in the range of
        exposure experienced by Asian and Western subjects and the higher average plasma exposure
        was not associated with a change in the tolerability profile of single dose selumetinib.

        Investigators should make a clinical judgment as to whether the potential risk of
        experiencing higher selumetinib plasma exposure and potential adverse events outweighs the
        potential benefit of treatment with selumetinib.
