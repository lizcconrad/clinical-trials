  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of CRAD001M2305 is to report the long-term effects of everolimus
      treatment on height, weight and sexual development (using Tanner Stages) in children and
      adolescents with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-associated with Subependymal Giant Cell
      Astrocytoma (SEGA). The study will monitor the growth and development of pediatric patients
      with TSC-associated SEGA, previously enrolled in CRAD001M2301 until they reach Tanner Stage
      V, or until age 16 for females or 17 for males whichever occurs first.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CRAD001M2305 is a prospective, multi-center phase IIIb/IV study. This study will investigate
      if the physical and sexual development of pediatric patients is affected by previous or
      ongoing treatment with everolimus. The study will monitor the growth and development of
      pediatric patients with TSC-associated SEGA, previously enrolled in CRAD001M2301 until they
      reach Tanner Stage V, or until age 16 for females or 17 for males whichever occurs first.
      Continued treatment with everolimus is at investigator discretion and is not required for
      participation in CRAD001M2305. Growth (height, weight), and sexual development (Tanner
      Stages, sex hormone levels, age at menarche, thelarche (females) and adrenarche (males)), and
      brain development (assessed by TAND Checklist, dates of brain MRI) of patients participating
      in this long-term follow-up study will be followed at annual visits to the site until
      patients achieve Tanner Stage V or age 16 (females), age 17 (males) whichever occurs first.
      Adverse events, concomitant medication, appearance of menarche, will be monitored and data
      collected every 3 months (&quot;3-monthly&quot;). Unless clinically indicated these 3-monthly visits
      can be performed per telephone.
