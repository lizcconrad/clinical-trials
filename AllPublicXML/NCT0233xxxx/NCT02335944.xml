    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of EGF816 in combination with INC280 and to estimate the preliminary anti-tumor
      activity of EGF816 in combination with INC280 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
