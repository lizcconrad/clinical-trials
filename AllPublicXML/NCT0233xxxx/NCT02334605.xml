  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal hyper reactivity is defined as an increased sensitivity of the nasal mucosa to stimuli
      such as temperature changes, changes in humidity, emotional stress, physical activity, smoke
      and/or other scents and gives often rise to nasal symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal
      obstruction and/or sneezing.

      nasal hyper reactivity is a clinical feature of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, affecting more
      than 20% of the total Western population.

      Cold, dry air exposure has been shown to be a reliable method for diagnosis of nasal
      hyperreactivity. The new, shorter protocol for cold dry air provocation that recently has
      been validated as a useful diagnostic tool to evaluate nasal hyperreactivity with high
      specificity and sensitivity, is already a major step forward but still rather time-consuming
      and not always very practical in use.

      A hyperosmolar saline solution loaded on a small nasal sponge as described earlier has also
      been reported as being an effective means of evaluation of nasal hyperreactivity. In
      addition, capsaicin nasal spray has also been reported as being an elegant tool for the
      evaluation of the response of TRP channels on the nasal mucosa.

      So far, we lack data on the comparison between the 3 different diagnostic tools for the
      evaluation of nasal hyperreactivity in rhinitis.
