        This study will include patients receiving treatment of Xofigo at certified nuclear
        medicine centers across Sweden during a two year period. It will consist of mCRPC patients
        and potentially some other patient groups in whom Xofigo may be used off-label including
        women, children, cancer patients having bone metastasis with a diagnosis other than CRPC,
        and patients with repeated courses of treatment or in excess of those recommended in the
        label. This study will be based on data extracted from two pre-established data sources: 15
        nuclear medicine centers across Sweden and the Swedish National Cancer Registry.
