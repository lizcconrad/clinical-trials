    <textblock>
      Many cancer survivor experience treatment-related impairments in mental abilities such as
      memory, attention, and concentration (known as cognition). Research indicates that physical
      activity can improve cognition in healthy adults; however, little is known about whether
      physical activity can improve cognition among cancer survivors. This study will test whether
      a physical activity intervention results in improvements in cognition among breast cancer
      survivors, which may lead to interventions to improve cognition.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  breast cancer survivors; diagnosed at stage 1, 2, or 3 less than 5 years ago -

          -  not scheduled for or currently undergoing chemotherapy; sedentary, defined as engaging
             in less than 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week

          -  accessible geographically and by telephone

          -  have access to the internet

          -  endorse experience difficulties with thinking abilities

          -  in addition, participants on adjuvant therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or aromatase
             inhibitors) must be able and willing to remain on that treatment for the 3-month
             intervention period to prevent confounding of biomarker concentrations by treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, orthopedic conditions that limit
             mobility, or any other serious medical condition that could make it potentially unsafe
             to be in an unsupervised physical activity intervention

          -  other primary or recurrent invasive cancer within the last 10 years (other than
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma of the cervix in situ)

          -  unable to commit to a 3-month intervention schedule; any condition that, in the
             investigators' judgment, would contraindicate increased physical activity or otherwise
             interfere with participation in the trial

          -  unable to provide a blood sample at the baseline measurement visit

          -  unable to speak and read English.
