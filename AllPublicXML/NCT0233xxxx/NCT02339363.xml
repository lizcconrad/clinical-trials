  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was a randomized controlled trial that explored the feasibility,
      acceptability, and effectiveness of short-term mindfulness training among adolescents. The
      primary purpose was to investigate the effectiveness of two main Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction components—sitting meditation and hatha yoga—on working memory, stress, anxiety and
      mindfulness. The influence of daily home practice compliance on intervention outcomes was
      also examined.

      The present study was a randomized controlled trial that explored the feasibility,
      acceptability, and effectiveness of short-term mindfulness training among adolescents. The
      primary purpose was to investigate the effectiveness of two main Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction components—sitting meditation and hatha yoga—on working memory, stress, anxiety and
      mindfulness. The influence of daily home practice compliance on intervention outcomes was
      also examined. Participants (N = 198 adolescents) were recruited from a large public middle
      school in southern California. Participants were randomly assigned to sitting meditation,
      hatha yoga, or a waitlist control group. Participants were asked to complete a computerized
      working memory task, and self-report measures of perceived stress, anxiety, and mindfulness
      at pre- and post-intervention/waitlist, as well as one-month follow-up. A series of
      mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine changes in working memory,
      stress, anxiety, and mindfulness between groups at pre- and post- intervention.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>4 weeks (45-min sessions, 2x per week) of sitting meditation, based on MBSR. The sitting meditation condition consisted of three parts: (a) breathing techniques, (b) meditation, and (c) discussion. Participants in the sitting meditation group learned new types of sitting meditation each week. Participants in the sitting meditation group received a CD that consisted of audio meditations that they could follow along at home. The sitting meditation participants were encouraged to practice formal sitting meditation for 15 to 30 minutes every day and asked to record details of their practice on their daily home practice logs.</description>

    <description>4 weeks(45-min sessions, 2x per week) of Hatha Yoga. The adolescent hatha yoga curriculum was used with permission from Shanti Generation Yoga © (2009) created by Abby Wills. The hatha yoga sessions consisted of three parts: (a) breathing techniques, (b) yoga poses, and (c) discussion. Participants in the hatha yoga group learned a series of new yoga poses each week, as well as reviewed old poses. During the first session, participants in the hatha yoga group received a DVD that contained five yoga lessons corresponding to the yoga poses being taught in the intervention. Participants were encouraged to practice the series of yoga poses at home for 15 to 30 minutes each day and record their home practice in their daily home practice logs.</description>
