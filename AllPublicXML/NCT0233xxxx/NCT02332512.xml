  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a new kind of selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The investigators have finished the preclinical,phase I and
      phase II clinical studies and found its promising anti-tumor activity and tolerable
      toxicities. A disease-control rate of 61.1% and a mPFS of 4.7 months were showed in apatinib
      phase II study in patients with NSCLC.

      The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of apatinib to placebo in advanced
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients.
