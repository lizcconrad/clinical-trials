  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical stress creates a state of insulin resistance which has been related to increased
      postoperative complications. Fasting before surgery induces a catabolic state that
      contributes to the development of insulin resistance. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the effect of preoperative oral carbohydrates on postoperative insulin resistance in patients
      undergoing OPCAB (off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery). Sixty patients, aged 20 to 79
      years, scheduled for OPCAB will be divided into carbohydrate (n=30) and control (n=30)
      groups. Randomly selected patients of the carbohydrate group are given 400ml of 12.8 g/100 ml
      carbohydrate beverage in the evening before surgery and in the morning of the operation day
      (3 hours before their scheduled operation). In contrast, patients in the control group
      consume no food or drink after midnight before their surgery. The primary endpoints are
      postoperative insulin resistance measured by short insulin tolerance test.
