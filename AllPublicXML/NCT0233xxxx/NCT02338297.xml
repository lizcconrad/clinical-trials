  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a key palliative treatment for patients
      with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Arterioportal shunts (APS) can aggravate
      portal hypertension and the shunts let lipiodol flow to normal liver tissue and result in
      poor Lipiodol deposition in the tumor, causing liver ischemia.

      Occlusion of APS is a vital and initial step for the following embolization of tumor.
      Ethanol-gelfoam mixture(EGM) and gelfoam only both can occlude APS in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EGM in treatment of APS in
      the procedure of TACE, and to analyze the prognostic factors for survival in this kind of
      patients.
