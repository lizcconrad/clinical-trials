  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate, during a 12-week follow-up, a greater efficacy of
      using Sorbact® dressing technology in addition to best local cares compared to best local
      cares alone in the management of diabetic foot ulcers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will select a target population of diabetic patients treated for foot ulcers of
      neuropathic origin, with or without arterial disease but not presenting critical limb
      ischaemia. No definitive wound infection should be present at inclusion. According to
      randomization, all present ulcers at baseline will be treated either with best local cares
      not including Sorbact® dressing or including systematically for all ulcers this medical
      device.

      The main study endpoint will be a composite criterion defining a favourable limb outcome for
      a given patient. This criterion will be considered as present if total open wound area has
      decreased by 50% or more at last available evaluation whereas no definitive infection has
      occurred and no amputation has been required.

      Patients will be followed over a maximal period of 12 weeks. At D0 (inclusion), W2, W4, W6,
      W8, W10 and W12 a detailed description of ulcer aspect will be done. Applied dressing will be
      removed according to a standardized procedure. Wound area tracing and photography of all
      ulcers will be performed. Off-loading system's adherence will be checked.

      Between these weekly evaluations, all performed local cares will be reported and each
      dressing removal will be performed by using a similar procedure.

    <description>The basic Sorbact® presentation is an antimicrobial, non-adhesive absorbent wound dressing. It consists of a highly absorbent hydropolymer matrix with an antimicrobial Sorbact® mesh (Sorbact® acetate fabric coated with dialkyl carbamoyl chloride - DACC) and is covered by a semipermeable polyurethane film.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written consent to participate obtained.
