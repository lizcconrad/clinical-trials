  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre clinical trial done by us（ISRCEN90807007）showed that active acupuncture had
      significantly greater effect on symptoms of allergic rhinitis than either sham acupuncture or
      no active treatment. The object of that study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. As an explanatory research, acupuncture was defined as the
      only intervention for treatment group and sham acupuncture, no active treatment as its
      control groups. Besides, acupuncture combined moxibustion showed better and longer effect
      than acupuncture on allergic rhinitis patients in our previous pilot study. According to this
      result, we are taking a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to further evaluate whether
      acupuncture combined moxibustion is more effective than conventional treatment.
