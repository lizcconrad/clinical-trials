      This study is designed to collect post market data on use of the VEST, particularly on
      saphenous vein grafts to the right territory of the heart.

      The primary objective is to test the early-mid term patency rate of VEST supported Right
      Coronary Artery (RCA) bypass grafts. The research participants will undergo CABG preparations
      and CABG procedure routinely as is the standard of care. During the procedure the VEST will
      be implanted on the vein graft to the Right Coronary Artery according to the IFU.
      Perioperative care is according to standard of care. Upon discharge patient will be
      prescribed statins and aspirin for 6 months. Patient will attend a routine clinic visit 4-6
      weeks post operatively. The last study visit will occur 3-6 months post operatively. Patients
      will undergo a noninvasive coronary CT angiography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient scheduled for on-pump CABG on clinical grounds

          2. At least one vein graft bypass indicated for right coronary artery and LIMA indicated
             for the LAD on clinical grounds

          3. Appropriately sized and accessible target coronary arteries, with a minimum diameter
             of 1.5 mm and adequate vascular bed, as assessed from the pre-operative cardiac
             angiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concomitant non-CABG cardiac procedure

          2. Prior cardiac surgery

          3. Emergency CABG surgery (cardiogenic shock, inotropic pressure support, IABP)

          4. Contraindication for on-pump CABG with cardioplegic arrest (e.g. severely calcified
             aorta)

          5. Calcification at the intended anastomotic sites, as assessed upon opening of the chest
             and before VEST implantation.

          6. Prior debilitating stroke less than 1 year before surgery

          7. Severe renal dysfunction (Cr&gt;2.0 mg/dL)

          8. Concomitant life-threatening disease likely to limit life expectancy to less than 2
             years.
