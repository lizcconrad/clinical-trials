      This phase I trial studies the safety of SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete
      Freund's adjuvant together with sargramostim in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      multiple myeloma who are receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Vaccines made from
      survivin peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells
      that express survivin. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant may help stimulate the body's immune
      response to a vaccine treatment. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may
      increase the production of blood cells. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine
      in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and sargramostim before or after the start of lenalidomide
      maintenance therapy may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide (SVN53-67/M57-KLH
      peptide vaccine) in Montanide ISA 51 (incomplete Freund's adjuvant) plus GM-CSF
      (sargramostim) (vaccine), given before or after the start of lenalidomide maintenance in
      patients with multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the immune responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 plus
      GM-CSF, either alone or with lenalidomide maintenance added either before or after the
      vaccine.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary data on therapeutic efficacy of this combination against multiple
      myeloma, including response rate, time to progression and disease progression slope.

      II. To test if human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types and survivin positivity affect the immune
      responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 plus GM-CSF.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant
      subcutaneously (SC) and sargramostim SC every 2 weeks at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 for up to 4
      doses and then receive a booster in week 12. Beginning in week 4, patients receive
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B: Patients receive SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant SC
      and sargramostim SC every 2 weeks at weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10 for up to 4 doses and then receive
      a booster in week 16. Beginning in week 0, patients receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy
      PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 16, 20, and 24 weeks and
      then every 3 months for up to 5 years.

    <description>The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 will be used to evaluate toxicity. The maximum grade of toxicity for each category of interest will be recorded for each patient and the summary results will be tabulated by category and grade. The frequency of toxicities will also be tabulated for the regimen estimated to be the regimen-limiting toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Immune response using interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and multimer assays</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A responder is defined as a patient who has responded in either IFN-gamma ELISPOT or multimer assays. For both the ELISPOT and multimer assays, time course and magnitude of responses will be plotted and data will be treated using mixed-effect modeling. In addition, Kendall's tau-b will be used to determine whether ELISPOT and multimer responses are associated.</description>
