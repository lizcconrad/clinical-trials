      The study will aim to determine the effectiveness of a strength training program using
      resistance bands to increase strength in adults ≥65 years old

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults in the US are in a difficult situation that is historically unprecedented.
      People born in 1930 were expected to live to age 59, yet they will live to an average age of
      79. These dramatic survival increases, due to immunizations, antibiotics and other
      innovations [Centers for Disease, 2011], have occurred at the same time as dramatic
      reductions in daily energy expenditures, due to automobiles, washing machines and other
      labor-saving devices [Archer, 2013]. This has left adults living longer, yet weaker, less fit
      and more obese. In fact, most residents of nursing homes are not there because of dementia.
      Only 40% of long-term care facility residents in 2010 were diagnosed with dementia [Caffrey,
      2012] and many of whom had a level of dementia which would not require nursing home placement
      by itself. Most residents of long-term care facilities, rather, are there because they lack
      the strength and fitness to care for themselves. As baby boomers retire, these factors are
      anticipated to greatly increase the need for long-term care, highlighted in a report from a
      Deloitte Consulting in 2010: &quot;Medicaid Long-term Care: The ticking time bomb&quot; [Keckley,
      2010]. This pilot study will measure a significant increase in strength with the use of a 12
      week strength training program.
