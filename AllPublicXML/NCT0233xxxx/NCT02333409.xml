  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. Patients
      suffering from pancreatic cancer are associated with a poor prognosis and survival of less
      than one year is expected in inoperable tumours (1). Management of these patients would be
      towards palliation of symptoms. Severe pain occurs in 50 to 70% of the patients and this
      &quot;intractable&quot; pain is often difficult to treat (2). Pain management is a major part of the
      comprehensive therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer, and it also affects their quality
      of life. Electroacupuncture seems to be a promising way to control the cancer pain and reduce
      the dose and side effects of pain killers including opioid. This study aimed to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in reducing pancreatic cancer pain in patients
      suffering from inoperable pancreatic cancer.

      Patients suffering from pancreatic cancer are associated with a poor prognosis and survival
      of less than one year is expected in inoperable tumours. Management of these patients would
      be towards palliation of symptoms. Severe pain occurs in 50 to 70% of the patients and this
      &quot;intractable&quot; pain is often difficult to treat. Pain management is a major part of the
      comprehensive therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer, and it also affects their quality
      of life. Different pharmacological agents have been used in the past to control this pain and
      these include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotic agents. However, these
      agents are associated with their own adverse effects and may further impair quality of life.
      Radiotherapy and celiac plexus neurolysis also can relieve the cancer pain, patients'
      responses are often variable and difficult to predict.

      Recently, more and more studies were focused on the acupuncture for cancer pain.
      Electroacupuncture (EA) analgesia seems to be a promising way to control the cancer pain and
      reduce the dose and side effects of analgesics. The latest review in 2012 showed that
      acupuncture might be an effective analgesic adjunctive method for cancer pain after
      concluding the results of 15 randomized-control trials. Nevertheless, studies focused on
      patients with pancreatic cancer and results from randomized trials are lacking.

      This study aims to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of EA analgesia for patients
      with inoperable pancreatic cancer.

    <description>A Hong Kong registered Chinese Medicine practitioner will give Electroacupuncture treatments. Patients will be treated in a comfortable prone position. Jiaji (Ex-B2) points form T8 to T12 bilaterally are chosen based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory and neurophysiologic basis of Jiaji points. After De Qi sensation is achieved, the handles of needles on homolateral T8-T12 Jiaji are respectively connected to the Han's acupoint nerve stimulator at a frequency of 2/100 Hz and a current of 1 mA with a disperse-dense waveform. The needles remained for 30 min. The treatment was given twice weekly on week 1 and week 3.</description>

    <description>For placebo acupuncture, sham placebo acupuncture needles (DongBang AcuPrime Acupuncture Inc., South Korea) will be used. Its validity and credibility have been well demonstrated. The needles with blunt tips are quickly put onto the same points used in the electroacupuncture group without inserting into the skin. The needles on homolateral T8 and T12 Jiaji are then connected to the electric stimulator, but with zero frequency and electric current.</description>
