  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is one of the most common benign gynecological, affecting about 10% of
      premenopausal women. The pathophysiology of this disease is still not completely clear.
      Despite its prevalence, there is no blood test available for the diagnosis of endometriosis
      and the average delay time to diagnosis is 9.4 years.

      Metabolomics is a scientific discipline that studies changes in metabolites related to the
      pathophysiology of the disease.

      Aim of the study is to identify an alteration in the expression of the metabolites in women
      with endometriosis
