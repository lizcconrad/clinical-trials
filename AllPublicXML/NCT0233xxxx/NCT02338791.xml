      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of movement between the bones of the
      shoulder joint when mobilization techniques are applied by a physical therapist.

      The purpose of this study is to image the articular joint movement of the glenohumeral joint
      utilizing ultrasound imaging (USI). Specific aims include: 1) measurement of the distance
      between the articular surfaces at rest; 2) measurement of the distance between the articular
      surfaces during manually applied glides of those surfaces; and 3) analysis of any association
      between the amount of glide and reported joint mobility, force application, or joint
      position.

      Subjects will be recruited from a population of convenience. After consenting to participate,
      eligible subjects will complete a demographic questionnaire and pretesting of scapular and
      shoulder mobility. Two days of testing will be scheduled. On the first day, three grades of
      glenohumeral mobilization will be applied in the following directions: distraction, posterior
      and inferior. A handheld dynamometer will measure force; ultrasound imaging will record
      glenohumeral joint position. Each grade and direction will be repeated three times on the
      right and the left shoulder. On the second day, the mobilizations will be repeated.
      Measurements of humeral movement will be calculated from the ultrasound images.

    <measure>Movement of the humeral head</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate measurement of humeral head movement concurrent with application of manual mobilization</time_frame>
    <description>The movement of the humeral head in reference to the glenoid fossa is recorded using ultrasound imaging. The amount of movement (as measured in millimeters) between the image taken on rest and the image taken during the manual mobilization is calculated for each direction of manual mobilization. This primary outcome measure is obtained during the performance of the manual mobilization. Subjects are tested and this primary outcome measured during the intervention (manual mobilization) on Day one and, within one week, on Day two. Each subject participates in the study for approximately one week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Force of Mobilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate measurement of force used during the application of manual mobilization</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of force used during the application of grade I, grade II and grade III mobilizations. The maximal force used during the performance of the manual mobilization (as measured in Newtons) is recorded using a hand held dynamometer as the mobilization is performed. Subjects are tested and this secondary outcome measured during the intervention (manual mobilization) on Day one and, within one week, on Day two. Each subject participates in the study for approximately one week.</description>

    <description>Stabilization of the glenoid fossa with movement of the humerus using varying degrees of force as applied by a physical therapist. Subject is positioned with the shoulder in 55 degrees of abduction and 30 degrees of horizontal adduction. Manual force is applied by a physical therapist on the proximal humeral head moving the humeral head posterior, inferior or lateral (distraction). An ultrasound transducer placed over the anterior shoulder joint provides imaging of the humeral head and the glenoid fossa. This manual intervention is repeated three times in each direction on each arm.</description>
