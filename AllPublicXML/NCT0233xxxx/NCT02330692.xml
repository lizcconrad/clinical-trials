      Developing a molecular genetic test that can identify prognostic factors which can predict
      response to treatment, and to contribute to the establishment of future therapeutic
      strategies base on prognostic factors by undergoing peripheral blood and bone marrow
      examination of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) patients at diagnosis and relapse.
