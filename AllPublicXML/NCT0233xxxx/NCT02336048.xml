  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety
      of a single infusion of tocilizumab versus placebo, administered in addition to standard
      premedications (antipyretic, antihistamine, and corticosteroid) prior to the first infusion
      of obinutuzumab administered in combination with oral chlorambucil to participants with
      previously untreated B-CLL who have comorbidities. All eligible participants will be treated
      with a total of 6 cycles of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil (cycle length = 28 days).
