      The HOW Study is a first-of-its-kind international online study for women and men with and
      without a history of breast cancer. The investigators will collect information about your
      health, your job, your diet, and your family history, among other topics that can help us get
      a better understanding of breast cancer and its potential causes. Periodically, the
      investigators will send you questionnaires about anything and everything. All you have to do
      is fill them out online. It's that simple. This is a partnership and the investigators need
      you for the long haul. The more questionnaires you fill out, the more information the
      investigators will have that can help us have a better understanding of why women get breast
      cancer.
