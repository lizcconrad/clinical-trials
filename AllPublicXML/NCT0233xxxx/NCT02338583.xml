      This prospective, single-arm multi-center study will provide clinical data in an
      observational setting using the Echelon Flex™ 45 and 60 Powered ENDOPATH® Stapler
      Articulating Endoscopic Linear Cutters (study Endocutter). Individuals undergoing VATS
      lobectomy for suspected or confirmed Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), or individuals
      undergoing VATS diagnostic wedge resection in accordance with their institution's Standard of
      care (SOC), and who meet study entry criteria, may be enrolled.

      Study procedures will include a wedge resection, wedge resection followed by lobectomy of the
      same lobe, or lobectomy.
