    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 120 binge-drinking MSM to 12 weeks of
      naltrexone 50mg, to be taken in anticipation of heavy drinking. Ethnically and racially
      diverse participants will be recruited using Respondent Driven Sampling as well as active
      field recruitment. MSM will be seen weekly for alcohol-metabolite urine testing, study drug
      dispensing, and brief counseling for alcohol use. Safety assessments and behavioral surveys
      will be completed monthly.

        Exclusion Criteria:
