  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During cataract surgery an artificial lens is implanted in the eye. These artificial lenses
      are called intraocular lenses (IOLs) and there are many different types of IOL designs. IOLs
      are of fixed focus and so unless a multifocal IOL is used you would need to wear spectacles
      for viewing near objects. This study has been designed to look at how well a multifocal IOL
      corrects distance and near vision in comparison with a conventional monofocal IOL. Both types
      of IOLs are commercially available and are commonly implanted. Using new non-invasive methods
      we hope to be able to better judge the visual performance of these IOLs. In addition the
      study will involve imaging and examining the IOLs to determine the prevalence of any
      post-operative complications.
