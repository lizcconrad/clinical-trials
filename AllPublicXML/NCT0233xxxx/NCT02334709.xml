  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are often used in the standard treatment for patients with
      metastasized renal cell carcinoma. In addition to their ability to specifically inhibit tumor
      growth, TKIs also interfere with the vascularisation of the tumor. Unfortunately, most
      patients do not obtain long-lasting clinical benefit from this treatment. The goal of the
      current study is to enhance the effect of TKIs by combining them with stereotactic
      radiotherapy treatment of one of the metastases. This type of radiotherapy allows us to
      precisely irradiate the tumor with minimal effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. Recently
      it has been demonstrated that this type of radiotherapy stimulates the immune system to
      attack the tumor. By combining stereotactic radiotherapy with TKIs we expect to observe a
      reduction of metastases in a bigger population of patients.

      In the first part of our study we focus on the safety of the combination therapy. In the
      second part we will evaluate the combined treatment response.

    <description>A first line TKI will be administered according to the standard dosing of the drug for metastatic RCC during a 1-week run-in period after which SBRT will be delivered to the largest metastatic lesion concurrently with the TKI. The SBRT dose will be escalated in 3 dose levels, starting at 24Gy (8 Gy per fraction), followed by 30 Gy (10 Gy per fraction) and 36 Gy (12 Gy per fraction).</description>
