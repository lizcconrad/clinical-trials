  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this phase I/II, randomized, placebo controlled study is the assessment of
      safety and tolerability of universal donor FMT compared to placebo in pediatric and young
      adult subjects (ages 5 years through 30 years) with active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have
      have failed, are intolerant to, or have refused traditional first-line maintenance therapy.
      Secondary objectives include the identification biomarkers in both donor and recipient that
      may confer a clinical response and to establish whether or not ongoing FMT maintenance
      therapy is required for maintenance of clinical benefit in pediatric UC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, phase I/II, randomized, prospective, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study of FMT in the treatment of active pediatric UC. The primary aim is
      to assess safety and feasibility of a weekly FMT maintenance therapy. A total of 60 patients
      with active UC (as defined by PUCAI score of &gt;9) will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      FMT or placebo-FMT (study treatment) by retention enema for 1 week and oral, frozen
      encapsulated inocula/placebo for 7 weeks. After the first 8 weeks, subjects on FMT who
      improve or subjects on placebo-FMT who do not improve will have the option to continue on
      study treatment or switch to open-label FMT until the end of 4 months from study initiation.
      Subjects will be followed by telephone to assess adverse events for a total of 6 months after
      their last FMT dose.

      An initial subset of 10 subjects will be enrolled in the study (will be limited to only those
      patients 12 years of age or older and to those who have mild to moderate Crohn's Disease) and
      randomized to receive FMT or placebo. We'd expect short term adverse events to occur within 7
      days of FMT administration. Individual subject safety data will be reviewed by the PI to
      assess whether FMT appears to be safe in the subject before continuing the subject towards
      open-label use of FMT.

      Patient metadata and stool samples will be collected at key time points. The patient-reported
      metadata collection technique will allow for numerous clinical correlations to be parsed out
      using the random forest machine learning capabilities of synthetic learning in microbial
      ecology (SLiME) to identify taxonomic features associated with important clinical parameters.
