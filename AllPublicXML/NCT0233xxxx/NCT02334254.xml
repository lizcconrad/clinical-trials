    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety for the combination of Rivaroxaban and Ticagrel versus triple
      antithrombotic regimen (Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA), Clopigogrel and Aspirin) in patients with
      atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both physician and participant know the treatment that the participant
      receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter clinical study
      assessing the safety of the combination of rivaroxaban and ticagrel versus triple
      antithrombotic regimen (warfarin, clopigogrel and aspirin) in patients, who have paroxysmal,
      persistent, or permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant coronary
      artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A target of 420
      participants will be randomized into the study, with approximately 210 participants in each
      treatment strategy group. Primary comparisons will be made of the rates of major and
      clinically relevant bleeding, assessed by the modified International Society of Thrombosis
      and Haemostasis (ISTH) classification. The study consists of a screening phase, a 12-month
      open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-treatment/early withdrawal visit. The total
      duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 12 months.

    <description>Major bleeding was assessed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) definition. It included bleeding that was fatal, occurred in a critical location (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or pericardial), or was associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was defined as bleeding that required medical or surgical intervention.</description>
