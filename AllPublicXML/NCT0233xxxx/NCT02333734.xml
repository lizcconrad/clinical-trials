  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to examine the blood flow in the thigh muscles and
      sugar metabolism before and after 8 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on a
      bicycle ergometer in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and matched controls. The following
      parameters are included in the assessment:

        -  Sugar Metabolism

        -  Muscle and fat mass

        -  The blood flow at rest around the thigh muscles

        -  Oxygen uptake test on a bicycle ergometer and 5 km time trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be defined as a bihormonal metabolic disorder characterised by
      insufficient insulin secretion and abnormal glucagon secretion. It is however well
      established that physical activity per se improves glucose and may postpone or even slow down
      in the diabetic population. Glycaemic control may be improved more by high intensity interval
      training than by intensities from existing recommended guidelines. Additionally, there seems
      to be accumulating evidence that high intensity interval training induces increased overall
      fat and abdominal fat mass loss as opposed to traditional continuous endurance training
      Therefore we hypothesise that 3 weekly sessions of high intensity interval training (10×60
      sec. at an intensity inducing 90% of maximal heart frequency with a recovery of 60 sec.
      between each bout) over 8 weeks improves overall glycaemic control (glucose, insulin and
      glucagon), inflammatory status (interleukins, cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion
      molecules) and blood flow (NO and PGI2 vasodilatory capabilities).

    <description>Performed supervised high intensity interval training 3 times a week over 8 weeks on a bicycle ergometer (with watt meter). During the training period, the trainee individually established program, each time with 10 × 60 sec. workout (interspersed with 60 sec. break) corresponding to a force which during the test cycle induces ~ 90% of the maximum heart rate. The time spent per session is expected to last ~ 25 minutes.</description>
