      The purpose of the research study is to evaluate how well the Distortion Correction Data
      Collection (DCDC) App works. The DCDC App is an experimental software application that is
      being developed at the University of Nebraska Omaha. The DCDC app will map and draw the
      visual distortions of patients with Age-related Macular degeneration.

      This research study is a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Distortion
      Correction Data Collection (DCDC) App on a computer tablet system. There are two objectives
      in this study. The primary objective is to evaluate the functionality of the visual
      distortion app on the tablet computer. Patients will draw their distortions on the tablet
      screen, and the app will record and correct the distortions.The second objective is to create
      a distortion data repository (DDR) that contains retinal maps, data pertaining to the
      anatomical and functional aspects of patients retinas and the distortions. This DDR will be
      used to correlate retinal health to distortions.The correlation will be key in improving the
      correction software of the app. Long term, the app will be used to create a diagnostic tool
      and improve image processing in retinal prosthesis systems.

      Participating subjects must be at least 55 years of age or older with age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). After consent, a chart review will be performed. At the baseline visit,
      subjects will have an electroretinogram (ERG). At the single study visit, to be scheduled
      within 2 weeks of the baseline visit, subjects will use the DCDC app on a tablet computer to
      trace their visual distortions on an Amsler grid. Up to 5 subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The duration of the study is a 2 hour baseline
      visit and a 1 hour study visit, all within 2 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  55 years of age or greater

          -  Diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of (20/40 to 20/200 Snellen equivalent).

          -  Visual distortion is present in at least one eye, as determined by Amsler grid
             evaluation.

          -  Have had the following imaging tests completed within the past three months as part of
             standard of care: optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
             (SLO), and Fluorescein angiography (FA).

          -  Capable of understanding the requirements of the study, willing to follow study
             instructions, able to provide written informed consent to participate, and willing to
             comply with all study requirements.

          -  Women who are post-menopausal or not otherwise of child-bearing potential -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Visual field loss from diseases other than AMD.

          -  Visual distortions from the following conditions other than AMD: epiretinal membrane,
             diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with edema, and cystoid
             macular edema.

          -  A medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that
             would significantly decrease ability to follow study instructions.
