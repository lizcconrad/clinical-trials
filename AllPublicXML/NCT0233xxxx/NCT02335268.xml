    <textblock>
      There are currently no licensed drugs in the EU to treat thrombocytopenia in MDS patients
      classified as IPSS low/int-1. Prior studies with romiplostim (a TPO receptor agonist) in MDS
      found that baseline concentration of TPO as well as transfusion history were predictive of
      subsequent response in a retrospective model. The current prospective study has the aim to
      explore whether both pretreatment variables (endogenous TPO, TPO-level, platelet transfusion
      history) can predict the response to subsequent short-term treatment with romiplostim.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies of the
      pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, progressive bone
      marrow failure, and the propensity to transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Malcovati et
      al., 2013).

      There are currently no licensed drugs in the EU to treat thrombocytopenia in MDS patients
      classified as IPSS low/int-1. Prior studies with romiplostim (a TPO receptor agonist) in MDS
      found that baseline concentration of TPO as well as transfusion history were predictive of
      subsequent response in a retrospective model.

      Classically, MDS is associated with apoptosis and excessive proliferation, resulting in a
      combination of a hyper-cellular marrow and peripheral cytopenia. The rationale for using
      romiplostim in MDS is to stimulate normal progenitor cells to increase platelet counts. Upon
      correction of thrombocytopenia, responding MDS patients should have a decreased risk of
      bleeding and a reduction in platelet transfusions (Giagounidis et al., 2014). This reduction
      in platelet transfusions may in turn decrease the risks of alloimmunization and the resultant
      morbidity and costs associated with that condition.
