  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though the effects of anesthetic agents both inhalation and intravenous have been well
      described, the effect of laryngeal mask airways haven't. The purpose of the study is to
      determine the effects of different types of laryngeal mask airways on middle ear pressure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients in each group of laryngeal mask airway will contain 20 patients. In all
      groups middle ear pressures will be measured, in both right and left ear, preoperatively,
      after induction of anesthesia, insertion of laryngeal mask and in 1st., 5th., 10th. minutes
      and every 5 minutes perioperatively and recorded. Also the heart rates,arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2), airway pressures and end-tidal carbon dioxide values will be recorded
      before and following induction of anesthesia and in 1st., 5th., 10th. minutes and every five
      minutes perioperatively. Patients will be followed during the hospital stay for any
      complications.In all groups premedication will be done with midazolam. Anesthesia will be
      inducted with propofol and fentanyl; and maintained with sevoflurane-air combination.

    <description>Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is manufactured from medical grade silicone rubber and is reusable. It consists of 3 main components: An airway tube, inflatable mask and mask inflation line. The airway tube is slightly curved to match the oropharyngeal anatomy, semirigid to facilitate atraumatic insertion and semitransparent, so that condensation and regurgitated material is visible. The distal aperture of the airway tube opens into the lumen of an inflatable mask and is protected by two flexible vertical rubber bars, called mask aperture bars, to prevent the epiglottis from entering and obstructing the airway. The laryngeal mask classical application will be done following anesthesia induction.</description>

    <description>I-Gel LMA is anatomically designed mask made of a gel-like thermoplastic elastomer. It has a drain tube for gastric aspiration. I-gel laryngeal mask application will be done following anesthesia induction.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cobra</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cobra LMA consists of a translucent silicone airway tube with an inflatable cuff sited approximately two-thirds of the way to the tip, a 15-mm standard adapter and an expanded distal end with a smooth posterior surface. The cuff forms a seal in the upper pharynx and the distal end sits in the laryngopharynx. The distal grill is designed to sit over the laryngeal inlet.Cobra laryngeal mask application will be done following induction of anesthesia</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Supreme LMA is a single-use polyvinyl chloride supraglottic device. High oropharyngeal leak pressures are important as they indicate airway protection, feasibility of positive pressure ventilation and likelihood of successful LMA placement.Supreme laryngeal mask application will be done following induction of anesthesia and anesthesia.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The ProSeal LMA is the most complex of the specialized laryngeal mask devices.The primary design goal was to construct a laryngeal mask with improved ventilatory characteristics that also offered protection against regurgitation and gastric insufflation. The principal new features are a modified cuff and a drain tube.Proseal laryngeal mask application will be done following induction of anesthesia and anesthesia.</description>
