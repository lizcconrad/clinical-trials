    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate safety and tolerability of a novel antimicrobial
      wound dressing, Antimicrobial TheraGauze. The unique microvillous structure of TheraGauze is
      ideal for the development of an antimicrobial wound dressing. In vitro testing has
      demonstrated that tobramycin is an ideal compound for integration into TheraGauze providing
      excellent killing of MRSA and other organisms that commonly cause wound infections.
      Tobramycin is a non-absorbable aminoglycoside that will be contained solely to the wound bed
      preventing any potential for systemic toxicities. In vivo testing of tobramycin-impregnated
      TheraGauze used in mouse wound models has confirmed no systemic absorption of tobramycin as
      demonstrated by undetectable blood levels. TheraGauze has been commercially available for 10
      years as a wound dressing. Tobramycin has been available for many years as a topical
      antibiotic as eyedrops and as an inhaled antibiotic for patients with cystic fibrosis,
      demonstrating excellent safety in both cases.

      This Phase I trial will test Antimicrobial TheraGauze (ATG) as an antimicrobial wound packing
      for patients presenting to an Emergency Department with skin abscess (furunculosis). Subjects
      will either receive ATG or standard of care wound packing (cotton wick or iodoform wick).
      Subjects will return to the ED in 2 days for wound packing removal and reassessment of their
      wounds and symptomatology. A final followup will be performed by a physician and study
      coordinator in an outpatient setting on day 7.

      Primary Endpoint. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety of and identify
      side effects of TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing compared with standard of care management
      for cutaneous abscesses requiring incision and drainage.

      Methods.

      Design:

      This is a proof-of-concept, prospective, randomized clinical trial for safety of
      TheraGauze-tobramycin in adult subjects who present to Emergency Department settings for care
      of skin abscess requiring incision and drainage. A control, standard of care, arm is included
      to provide some data with respect to the side effect profile of current furunculosis
      management for comparison.

      Two arms are proposed for this study:

        1. Incision + TheraGauze+tobramycin packing (no systemic antibiotics)

        2. Incision + standard iodoform wick or plain cotton wick packing (± p.o. antibiotics)

           Anti-microbial TheraGauze (saturated tobramycin solution at 3 mg/ml) will be packed into
           the drained wounds of the subjects in the study arm. The control arm will receive
           current standard of care wound packing with a choice of iodoform wick or plain cotton
           wick, based on the preference of the ED physician. After packing, the wound excess
           TheraGauze or wick will be cut away. The ED physicians have the option to prescribe an
           oral antibiotic or not, according to their preference. The following oral antibiotic
           choices are available for subjects in the control arm only:

             -  Bactrim (TMP/SMX)

             -  Vibramycin (doxycycline)

             -  Cleocin (clindamycin) Antibiotics will be purchased by subjects from their local
                pharmacy.

           TheraGauze-tobramycin. We plan to use TheraGauze saturated with tobramycin at 3 mg/ml,
           the same dose used in the ophthalmic preparations (e.g., Tobrex) and much smaller
           concentration than the concentration in tobramycin bone cement (50 - 60 mg/ml). The
           decades of efficacy and safety with tobramycin eye drops justifies using the 3 mg/ml
           concentration. In vitro testing with TheraGauze/tobramycin (0.9 mg/ml), shows excellent
           broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial
           pathogens including all clinical MRSA strains tested (Echague, Hair et al. 2010). We
           expect that &gt;85% of the cutaneous abscesses (furuncles) will be infected with MRSA
           (Demos, McLeod et al. 2012). Additionally, tobramycin is a non-absorbable antibiotic and
           thus an excellent choice for achieving local antimicrobial activity with minimal risk of
           systemic side effects, which it is why it is the most common antibiotic bone cement.

           The TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing will be placed after the incision and drainage
           of the abscess and removed at the day 3 (± 1) follow up visit in the Emergency
           Department. TheraGauze/tobramycin will only be placed in the wound a single time.

           Methods:

           Study Population:

           Subjects from the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia will be recruited from
           the hospital emergency department site staffed by EVMS physicians at Sentara Norfolk
           General Hospital.

           Study Size:

           We anticipate screening 200 patients in order to enroll and randomize 100 subjects.
           Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to the TheraGauze+tobramycin or iodoform wick/ plain
           cotton wick, respectively. We anticipate 50 participants completing the study. The 50%
           retention rate is typical for emergency department populations.

           Recruitment and Retention:

           Subjects who present to Emergency Department setting for care of skin abscess requiring
           incision and drainage will be approached by on-site Study Coordinators for enrollment.
           Upon meeting eligibility criteria and willingness to participate, subjects/LARs will
           provide informed consent. A medical information release will be obtained from the
           subject so that outcomes data can be collected related to additional unscheduled visits
           or adverse events cared for outside the emergency department setting.

           Women and minority participation:

           Adults up to 65 years of age will be enrolled regardless of gender and minority status
           as long as they are fluent in English.

           Randomization:

           A study subject identification number will be assigned. Subjects will then be
           sequentially randomized to one of two treatment arms upon enrollment in a 2:1 ratio,
           using a prepared list.

           Study Treatments

           Visit 3 - Day 7 ± 1: (EVMS Clinical Research Unit):

           Follow up on subjects' wound status. The following information will be collected and
           recorded on a hard copy Case Report Form at this contact.

           • Questions about infection

             -  Wound assessment

           Statistical Analysis Plan The data will be analyzed using SAS 9.4 software. All
           statistical tests will be two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. Patients who
           withdraw while on treatment will be included in the data analysis for each time point
           before withdrawal. Baseline and follow-up measurements of safety, tolerability, numbers
           of pathogenic bacteria, wound infection persistence or worsening, and gross effects on
           the rate of wound healing will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean,
           median, standard deviation, interquartile range, frequency, and percentage where
           appropriate. Normality assessments for the continuous variables will be completed using
           Shapiro-Wilk tests and stem-and-leaf plots.

           Tests of equivalence between the TheraGauze + tobramycin and standard iodoform wick
           packing treatment groups will establish statistical significance if the two-sided 90%
           confidence interval for the difference falls within the limits (-δ, δ), where δ is the
           margin of clinically accepted difference. This analysis will determine whether the
           outcomes are equivalent between the TheraGauze+tobramycin and standard iodoform wick
           packing treatment groups.

           Protection of Human Subjects:

           This research involves the recruitment, enrollment and management of human subjects
           participating in research. Adults up to age 65 years at enrollment are being studied
           because adults commonly suffer skin abscesses. Study oversight by the investigators will
           assure compliance with all regulatory requirements for Institutional Review Board
           approval prior to the initiation of the study, and will obtain annual re-approval for
           study activities.

           Potential risks and benefits to subjects and procedures to mitigate risks:

           • Physical/Medical

             -  Serious/Adverse Events - will be reported to EVMS IRB

                  -  Confidentiality/PHI

             -  All PHI will be maintained in an encrypted and password protected electronic file.

           ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Subjects must be seen by a physician or an appropriately trained
           healthcare professional at every study visit, and the evaluation must be documented.

           Adverse Events. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation
           subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to
           have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable
           and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or
           disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not
           considered related to the medicinal product.

           Causality Assessment. For all AEs, the PI will provide an assessment of causal
           relationship to the study drug. Causal relationship must be assessed by answering the
           following question: Is there a reasonable possibility the study drug caused the event?

           Adverse Reaction. An AE assessed as likely having a causal relationship with the
           intervention (i.e., TheraGauze/tobramycin). Specifically focusing on local-toxicity
           adverse reactions, we will evaluate for increasing redness, increasing pain or a new
           rash at the site of the packed wound. Increasing pain or redness could be due to
           progression of the infection (cellulitis/abscess) or local toxicity or reaction to the
           tobramycin in the TheraGauze/tobramycin packing. This will be assessed by an
           Investigator. Increasing purulent drainage or the identification of new areas of
           fluctuance requiring an additional incision and drainage procedure will be assessed as
           progression of the infection rather than evidence of local toxicity or reaction to the
           tobramycin.

           Severity Assessment. The PI must provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by
           recording a severity rating, which will be assessed as described below. Severity, which
           is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from
           seriousness, which implies a subject outcome or AE-required treatment measure associated
           with a threat to life or functionality.

           Guidelines for Adverse Event Severity Assessments Mild. Minor awareness of signs or
           symptoms that are easily tolerated without specific medical intervention. Moderate.
           Discomfort that interferes with usual activities and may require minimal intervention.

           Severe. Significant signs or symptoms that are incapacitating with an inability to work
           or perform routine activities and/or that require medical intervention.

           Serious Adverse Events. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: is
           life threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing
           hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Important
           medical events may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment,
           they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to
           prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. If a serious and unexpected AE
           occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and
           the event the event must be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse
           reaction. SAE will be reported to the local IRB and the FDA within 5 calendar days.

           Stopping Rules. Adverse reactions, including local-toxicity adverse reactions, or SAEs
           will lead to immediate return to the SNGH ED for assessment and removal of the
           TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing. The investigator will assess the need for treatment
           of the adverse reaction or SAE and, if necessary, either treat or refer for treatment,
           as appropriate. The subject will continue with their scheduled follow up: Day 3 visit in
           the ED, Day 6 phone follow up, and Day7 visit in the EVMS Clinical Research Unit.
