        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is a man aged between ≤18 and ≥60 years

          2. BMI of ≥19 kg/m2 to ≤ 37 kg/m2

          3. The patient has a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-5™ (code 295.90)

          4. The patient has a Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≤ 4
             (moderately ill) at screening and safety baseline

          5. The patient is currently under oral therapy with one or more of the antipsychotic
             medications listed in Appendix II.

          6. The patient has a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score ≤ 80

          7. The patient has a score of ≤ 4 (moderate) on the following PANSS items at screening
             and at safety baseline: P7 (hostility), G8 (uncooperativeness)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient experienced an acute exacerbation requiring hospitalization within the
             last 3 months.

          2. The patient experienced an acute exacerbation requiring change in antipsychotic
             medication (with reference to drug or dose) within the last 4 weeks.

          3. The patient has a diagnosis or history of substance use disorder (except nicotine)
             according to DSM-5-TR® criteria ≤3 months prior to screening

          4. The patient is at significant risk of harming himself or others according to the
             investigator's judgment or as indicated by an answer of &quot;yes&quot; to the question 4 or 5
             on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at the Screening Visit within
             the last six months on the lifetime version of C-SSRS.

          5. Based on investigators judgment the patient has a medical or neurological disorder or
             treatment for such disorder that could interfere with the study treatment or impair
             treatment compliance.

          6. The patient has had past episodes of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) under current
             medication within the last 6 month

          7. The patient takes other medication than those listed as allowed concomitant medication
             in Appendix III

          8. The patient is occupationally exposed to significant levels of ionizing radiation.
