      40 patients attending IVF center during 2013 &amp;2014 were fulfilling criteria of poor response
      and they failed to go through OPU as they gave &lt;3 mature follicles on a dose of 300U GN or
      more. All patients were revised for history, examinations and investigations, including age,
      type and duration of infertility, day 3 FSH, Day 3 E2, AMH, AFC.

      40 patients attending IVF center during 2013 &amp;2014 were fulfilling criteria of poor response
      and they failed to go through OPU as they gave &lt;3 mature follicles on a dose of 300U GN or
      more. All patients were revised for history, examinations and investigations, including age,
      type and duration of infertility, day 3 FSH, Day 3 E2, AMH, AFC All patients were 35 years
      old ore more We exclude patient &gt;44ys ,AMH &lt;0.3ng/ml,FSH &gt;13, also patients of DM,
      endometriosis, general disease were excluded, any local uterine anomalies were excluded.

      All patients received OCP for one cycle Then all had taken estradiol tablet 2 mg for one week
      prior to menses of the test cycle from Day 21 to day 28 Then we divide them into 2 groups US
      were done to exclude any cyst or follicle &gt;10mm First group received 300 U r FSH +150 U
      urinary GN from day 2 till day of HCG,dose adjusted according to the response then 0.25
      cetrotide S.c was added on when leading follicle reach &gt;12 mm, HCG was given only if we have
      at least 3 mature follicles &gt;14 mm and the leading one &gt;17mm then OPU done after 36 hrs of
      HCG, oocytes were denuded and fertilized by ICSI to avoid low fertilization rate by
      conventional IVF,embryo transfer were done on day 3 when we have at least one embryo GI other
      wise cancelled ET, then cyclogest 800mg were given intravaginal for 14 days then quantitative
      BHCG done and considered positive if &gt; 5miu/ML 28 day after ET, TVS was done to confirm
      ongoing pregnancy by visualization of IU sac.

      Second group were received cetrotide 0.25 mg s.c alone from day 2 to day 8then we initiate GN
      therapy by same initial GN dose (300FSH+150U urinary GN).same adjustment of dose were done
      and antagonist restarted when DF &gt;12mm, till day of HCG, HCG,OPU, ET were done by same method
      and under same criteria, luteal support and follow were the same.
