      The objective of this observational trial is to assess application and convenience of Epiduo®
      PUMP under daily clinical practice conditions in patients with moderate to severe
      inflammatory acne using this drug in topical monotherapy or in combination with other drugs.
      In addition, efficacy of Epiduo® and incidence of adverse events will be assessed under
      marketed conditions. Also, patients' body beliefs will be recorded using the dysmorphic
      concern questionnaire.

      The observational study is designed as a multicentre study, covering all parts of Germany.
      Participating investigators are dermatologists with an adequate patient pool of acne
      patients. The observation time per patient will up to 3 months.
