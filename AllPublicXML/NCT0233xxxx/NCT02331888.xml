      Once in labor, the parturient will be connected to the routine fetal doppler and EUM. When
      necessary according to clinical indications, the scalp electrode will be connected. Tracing
      will be recorded simultaneously from all three devices until delivery.

      study design:

        1. signing an informed consent at vas&lt;3

        2. admittance to delivery room.

        3. Verifying inclusion and exclusion criteria, describing clinical rial goal, motivation
           and phases.

        4. Connecting the patient to three devices (fetal Doppler, scalp electrode and EUM)
           simultaneously.

        5. Recording fetal heart rate until delivery.

        6. Disconnecting the patient from all devices if required according to clinical need.

    <description>the parturient will be connected to the routine fetal Doppler and to the EUM. and When necessary to the scalp electrode will be connected. Tracings will be recorded simultaneously from all three devices until delivery. three separate outputs will be processed Output of the scalp electrode recording. Output of the fetal doppler. Output of the EUM. Three noncontinuous segments of 30 minutes each with two segments occurring during the first stage of labor and the third occurring during the second stage of labor, will be randomly picked from the scalp electrode recording with 3 matching segments in time from the EUM100pro and the fetal doppler.</description>
