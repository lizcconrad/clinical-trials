  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
      on patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

  <detailed_description>

      Central Hypothesis: Non-invasive brain stimulation that suppresses alpha oscillation reduces
      cortical hyperactivity and causes a clinical improvement

      Aim 1: To conduct a pilot clinical trial to establish feasibility and to collect first
      effectiveness data for the use of tACS to renormalize pathological alpha oscillations in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-pfc) of unmedicated patients with MDD by comparing MADRS
      scores from baseline and one month follow up.

      Aim 2: Compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first and
      last day of stimulation. Collect EEG data at the one month follow up visit using this data to
      analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be the primary outcome measures for this study</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks from baseline measure</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale to measure the severity of depressive episodes, where each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6. The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms. This measurement will be taken at baseline (first day of stimulation), last day of stimulation, at the 3 week and at the 5 week follow up visits. A comparison of MADRS scores between baseline and 5 week follow up is the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days from baseline measure (day 5) and 5 weeks from baseline measure</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS is a clinician-administered depression assessment and consists of 17 items with a total score range from 0 to 54. A higher score indicates a worse outcome. This measurement will be taken at baseline (first day of stimulation), last day of stimulation, at the 3 week and at the 5 week follow up visits. We will compare the scores between baseline and 5 week follow up.</description>
