  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single oral 75mg dose of
      palbociclib administered to healthy volunteers, and subjects with mild, moderate, and
      severely impaired hepatic function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-cohort single period study. The four cohorts will consist of healthy volunteers,
      and subjects with mild, moderate, and severely impaired hepatic function. Each cohort will
      receive the same treatment consisting of a single oral 75mg dose of palbociclib administered
      with food. Serial PK samples will be drawn up to 120 hours post dose for the cohort
      consisting of healthy volunteers, and will continue until up to 192 hours post-dose for the
      cohorts of hepatic impairment subjects.

        <description>Maximum absolute values of post baseline electrocardiogram were summarized for PR interval, QRS complex, QT interval, QTcB (QT interval calculated using Bazett’s correction factor), and QTcF (QT interval calculated using Fridericia’s correction factor). The number of participants with maximum absolute values of post baseline electrocardiogram meeting the following criteria was reported: (1) PR interval &gt;=300 msec; (2) QRS complex &gt;=140 msec; (3) QT interval 450 to &lt;480 msec; (4) QT interval 480 to &lt;500 msec; (5) QT interval &gt;= 500 msec; (6) QTcB 450 to &lt;480 msec; (7) QTcB 480 to &lt;500 msec; (8) QTcB &gt;= 500 msec; (9) QTcF 450 to &lt;480 msec; (10) QTcF 480 to &lt;500 msec; and (11) QTcF &gt;=500 msec. Seven (7) participants in each cohort were evaluated for electrocardiogram tests except that 6 participants in the moderate hepatic impairment cohort (Cohort 3) were evaluated for PR interval.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Post Baseline Electrocardiogram Values Meeting Categorical Summarization Criteria (Maximum Increase From Baseline)</title>
        <description>Maximum increases from baseline for post baseline electrocardiogram values were summarized for PR interval, QRS complex, QT interval, QTcB (QT interval calculated using Bazett’s correction factor), and QTcF (QT interval calculated using Fridericia’s correction factor). The number of participants with maximum increase from baseline for post baseline electrocardiogram values meeting the following criteria was reported: (1) percent change of PR interval &gt;=25/50%; (2) percent change of QRS complex &gt;=50%; (3) QT interval 30 to &lt;60 msec; (4) QT interval &gt;= 60 msec; (5) QTcB 30 to &lt;60 msec; (6) QTcB &gt;= 60 msec; (7) QTcF 30 to &lt;60 msec; and (8) QTcF &gt;= 60 msec. Seven (7) participants in each cohort were evaluated for electrocardiogram tests except that 6 participants in the moderate hepatic impairment cohort (Cohort 3) were evaluated for PR interval.</description>
