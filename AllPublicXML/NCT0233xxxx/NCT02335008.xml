      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that repeated consumption of artificial
      sweetener reduces sweet taste intensity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant controversy surrounds the possibility that consumption of artificial sweeteners
      (AFS) leads to weight gain. Some studies have found correlations between AFS use and weight
      gain and/or diabetes [1-4] while others have indicated that AFSs may aid in weight loss [5]
      or have no effects on body mass index (BMI) [6]. In rats, exposure to AFS leads to reduced
      chow intake following a sweet preload [7, 8], higher body weight [9, 10] and increased
      glucose responses and decreased GLP1 release following an oral glucose tolerance test [11]
      compared to exposure to caloric sweeteners. Given that the five FDA approved AFSs are found
      in thousands of foods [12] this marks a clear and significant gap in knowledge. Our
      preliminary data demonstrate a 3-fold decrease in sweet taste sensitivity following
      consumption of a beverage sweetened with two packets of Splenda for just 10 days. These data
      provide strong evidence that repeated exposure to sucralose reduces perception of sweet taste
      intensity, most likely by down-regulation of the sweet taste receptor. Therefore, it is
      imperative that we gain a greater understanding of the consequences of AFS use, since
      alterations in sweet taste perception that occur in response to AFS exposure may promote
      weight gain.
