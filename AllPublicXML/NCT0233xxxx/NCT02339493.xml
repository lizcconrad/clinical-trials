  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most preventable cause of stroke. CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc
      scores predict the likelihood of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Atrial flutter
      confers a similar risk of stroke as atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin,
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban is effective for prevention of thromboembolic
      stroke in most patients with AF. However, despite widely available risk stratification tools,
      five options for anticoagulation, and evidence-based practice guidelines, thromboprophylaxis
      for stroke prevention in AF is under-prescribed in the U.S., Europe, and worldwide. The
      investigators have previously demonstrated the efficacy of an alert-based computerized
      decision support (CDS) strategy for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
      at-risk hospitalized patients not receiving any thromboprophylaxis. The investigators' goal
      is to create and evaluate an alert-based CDS strategy for stroke prevention in patients with
      nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter in a randomized controlled trial.

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most preventable cause of stroke. CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc
      scores predict the likelihood of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Atrial flutter
      confers a similar risk of stroke as atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin,
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban is effective for prevention of thromboembolic
      stroke in most patients with AF. However, despite widely available risk stratification tools,
      five options for anticoagulation, and evidence-based practice guidelines, thromboprophylaxis
      for stroke prevention in AF is under-prescribed in the U.S., Europe, and worldwide. The
      investigators have previously demonstrated the efficacy of an alert-based computerized
      decision support (CDS) strategy for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
      at-risk hospitalized patients not receiving any thromboprophylaxis. The investigators' goal
      is to create and evaluate an alert-based CDS strategy for stroke prevention in patients with
      nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators have the
      following specific aims:

      Aim #1 (Primary Endpoint)- To assess whether an alert-based computerized decision support
      strategy increases prescription of anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular AF or atrial
      flutter at risk for stroke and systemic embolism.

      Hypothesis #1- An alert-based computer decision support (CDS) strategy will increase
      prescription of anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter at risk for
      stroke and systemic embolism.

      Relevance- Failure to prescribe anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in AF represents
      a critical patient safety concern. The investigators successfully applied alert-based CDS to
      another important unmet patient safety need: prescription of thromboprophylaxis in
      hospitalized patients at increased risk for VTE. During Year 1 of this study, Brigham and
      Women's Hospital will design an alert-based CDS program to notify the individual clinician in
      a private electronic message that his or her hospitalized patient is at risk for stroke due
      to AF or atrial flutter. The message will specify that there is no order for anticoagulant
      therapy and will contain the patient's predicted risk of developing a stroke in the absence
      of anticoagulation. In Years 2 and 3, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled
      trial to evaluate the impact of an alert-based CDS strategy on prescription of anticoagulant
      therapy in at-risk patients with nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter.

      Aim #2 (Secondary Endpoint)- To determine the potential impact of an alert-based computerized
      decision support strategy on the frequency of stroke and systemic embolism in at-risk
      patients with nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter.

      Hypothesis #2- This study will provide proof-of-concept data, including event rates, from
      which to design a larger randomized control trial to assess whether an alert-based CDS
      strategy will reduce the frequency of stroke and systemic embolism in at-risk patients with
      nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter.

      Relevance- Strokes in patients with AF who are not prescribed anticoagulant therapy are an
      important source of morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. In a randomized controlled
      trial, the investigators previously demonstrated that alert-based CDS reduced the frequency
      of symptomatic VTE in high-risk hospitalized patients not ordered for thromboprophylaxis by
      41%. The investigators will now conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      potential impact of an alert-based CDS strategy to prevent stroke in at-risk patients with
      nonvalvular AF or atrial flutter not prescribed anticoagulants. The number of stroke
      endpoints will be too small to show a statistical difference. These data will provide
      information useful to assess the feasibility and calculate sample size estimates for a larger
      pivotal trial with clinical end points. Though the investigators' research will be conducted
      on hospitalized patients with AF or atrial flutter, the investigators' methodology can be
      extended to the outpatient setting in future studies.
