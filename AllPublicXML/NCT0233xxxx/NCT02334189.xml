  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to test whether it is possible to reduce pressure on Emergency Departments by
      sending a personal feedback letter to people who have recently attended an Emergency
      Department and whose health issues could likely have been dealt with elsewhere. These
      attendances clearly have many causes. However, it is likely that some attendances are due to
      behavioural factors - in other words, the various ways in which users interact with services.
      This study focuses on one particular behavioural factor: lack of feedback to users making
      avoidable visits.

      The study will take place in collaboration with an NHS hospital trust. Each week during the
      trial, the hospital trust will identify those Emergency Department attendances in the last
      seven days which, according to clinical judgement, could have been dealt with elsewhere.
      Patients will then be randomly selected to receive a letter containing information on
      alternative healthcare options for non-emergency health concerns. Patient records will be
      analysed to determine whether the patients who received the letter are less likely to make an
      avoidable repeat visit to the Emergency Department in the future, compared with patients who
      received no letter.
