  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial with a split mouth design. Patients with an indication
      of lower dental extraction will be asked to join this research project at the Department of
      Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at University of Damascus Dental School. Each patient whose
      case requires bilateral extraction, one side will serve as an experimental side, whereas the
      other side will serve as a control.

      Participants should have symmetric teeth that need extraction in the lower jaw. Hyaluronic
      acid will be injected following extraction in one of the two sides with random allocation.

      cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) images will be taken for each participant
      immediately post-extraction and at six months post-operatively.

      I- Clinical examination variables:

      Buccolingual distance and distomesial distance will be measured for each participant at 2
      assessment times: directly post-extraction and six months post-extraction.

      II- Radiographic examination variables:

      Linear measurements Vertical bone fill Bone mineral density

    <measure>Change in bone mineral density (BMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>(BMD) will be measured two times in this study: directly at the day of extraction and six months post-extraction.</time_frame>
    <description>BMD is the amount of bone tissue in a certain volume of bone. This variable is going to be measured on CBCT images.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical bone fill</measure>
    <time_frame>This variable is going to be measured at 6 months post-extraction</time_frame>
    <description>'Vertical bone fill' is the distance between the base of the extraction socket and cement-enamel junction directly after extraction and minus the distance between base of the extraction socket and cement-enamel junction six months post-extraction.
This variable is going to be measured on CBCT images.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Buccolingual distance</measure>
    <time_frame>at six months post-extraction</time_frame>
    <description>Buccolingual distance is the distance between buccal wall and lingual wall of the extraction socket. This variable is going to be measured clinically.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mesiodistal distance</measure>
    <time_frame>at six months post-extraction</time_frame>
    <description>Mesiodistal distance is the distance between mesial wall and distal wall of the extraction socket. This variable is going to be measured clinically.</description>
