  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a standard Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study of
      patients with relapsed and/or refractory Myeloma who have received at least two prior
      therapeutic treatments or regimens. Throughout the Phase I portion of this study, a standard
      3+3 dose escalation design will be utilized. Two dosing cohorts will evaluate escalating
      doses SAR650984 (5mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) with standard dose
      Carfilzomib (20-27 mg/mg2). Once a safe dose is established, an expansion cohort will further
      evaluate safety and begin to assess activity of this combination (SAR650984 (5mg/kg or 10
      mg/kg Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) with standard dose Carfilzomib).

      During the dose escalation portion of the study, the DLT period will be the first cycle (28
      days) or from Day 1 through Day 28 of initial study treatment.

      Expansion Phase Cohort An expansion cohort will begin once the MTD of SAR650984 plus standard
      dose Carfilzomib is established. The Expansion Cohort will enroll 18 patients for additional
      safety and preliminary efficacy data of SAR650984 plus Carfilzomib at the MTD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females, age 18 years or older.

          -  Diagnosis of MM and documentation of treatment with an IMiD® and proteasome inhibitor.
             Must have had 2 prior regimens/lines of therapy but there is no maximum number of
             prior regimens and prior autologous bone marrow transplant is acceptable if &gt; 12 weeks
             from transplantation. A line of therapy is defined as a course of therapy that is not
             interrupted by progressive disease. For example, induction therapy, autologous stem
             cell transplantation, and maintenance therapy without intervening progressive disease
             is one line of therapy.

          -  Confirmed evidence of relapse/disease progression from immediately prior MM therapy or
             refractory to the immediately prior treatment. Refractory disease is defined as those
             who are non-responsive (&lt; minimal response) on active therapy or experience disease
             progression within 60 days after the discontinuation of therapy. Relapsed disease is
             defined as achievement of at least a minimal response followed by disease progression
             on therapy or within 60 days of discontinuing active therapy.

          -  Patients may have received prior Carfilzomib (sensitive, relapsed and refractory all
             eligible) but must be &gt; 4 weeks from last dosing of Carfilzomib. In the expansion
             cohort, at least 10 patients will be required to be refractory to Carfilzomib
             (refractory defined as having evidence of disease progression while receiving
             Carfilzomib or within 60 days of stopping Carfilzomib therapy).

          -  Patients must have measurable disease defined as at least one of the following:

          -  Serum M-protein ≥0.5 g/dl (≥5 g/l)

          -  Urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 h

          -  Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dl (≥100 mg/l) and an abnormal serum free
             light chain ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65)

          -  Quantitative immunoglobulin &gt; 500mg/dL, only for IgA and IgD myeloma when the protein
             electrophoresis under-represents disease burden.

          -  Biopsy proven plasmacytoma (should be measured within 28 days prior to initial
             investigational agent dosing).

          -  Subject has an ECOG ≤ 2 performance status OR Karnofsky ≥ 60% performance status.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) - A female of childbearing potential is a
             sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive
             months may be included if the patient is not pregnant by a negative serum β-human
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.
             Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.
             FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex
             condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy.
             Females must agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and must agree to use a
             medically acceptable method of birth control as determined by the study doctor while
             participating in the study and for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of study
             medication.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of routine medical care with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance
