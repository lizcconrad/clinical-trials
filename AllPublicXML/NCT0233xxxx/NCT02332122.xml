  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center case-control study with 100 COPD patients will be organized to compare
      patients with and without bronchiectasis with regard to the presence of Aspergillus in sputum
      samples, Aspergillus sensitization and vitamin D. Induced sputum samples will be optimized
      for culture, Aspergillus galatomannan analysis and RT-PCR.

      This study is part of a larger project in which we assume that chronic respiratory infection
      by Aspergillus fumigatus and the accompanying immune response play an important role in the
      development of bronchiectasis in COPD. We suspect that this mechanism is controlled by
      vitamin D and it fails by suppression of the vitamin D receptor by Aspergillus fumigatus.

      The present study is designed by the Laboratory of pneumology and will be conducted in
      collaboration with the Laboratory of clinical bacteriology and mycology of the Catholic
      University of Leuven.

    <description>Patients will have to puff 200µg of salbutamol (metered-dose inhaler with spacer device). After 10 minutes FEV1 will be measured with MIR spirobank. If FEV1 is &gt;= 30% we can safely proceed with sputum induction. An ultrasonic nebulizer will be used to induce sputum. 4% sodiumchloride will be inhaled. Induction will be performed at 5-min intervals until a sample of good quality is obtained. Sodiumchloride of 5% will be used if no good sample is obtained after two intervals with the 4% solution. Maximal time of induction will be 20 minutes. Subjects will spit saliva into one container and rinse the mouth thoroughly with water before coughing sputum into another sterile container. Samples will be refrigerated at 4°C and processed within 24 hours of collection.</description>

    <description>Skin Prick Test is a reliable method to diagnose IgE-mediated allergic disease. It is minimally invasive and results are immediately available. Interpretation utilizes the presence and degree of cutaneous reactivity as a surrogate marker for sensitization. A positive control, a negative control and Aspergillus fumigatus will be tested. Location will be Protocol version 1 3/11/2014 marked on the volar aspect of the forearm and drops of each solution will be placed (&gt;= 2cm between drops). A single-head metal lancet will be pressed through the drop of allergen extract and held against the skin for at least 1 second. A new lancet will be utilized for each drop. A wheal diameter of &gt;= 3mm is a positive result.</description>

        Patients who present in the emergency department with an acute COPD exacerbation (as
        defined by GOLD executive summary) requiring hospitalization are eligible for this study.
        Patients should have an established diagnosis of COPD (based on clinical history or
        pulmonary function test). They will be recruited during their hospital stay in the
        University Hospital of Leuven.

        Additionally, we will include 20 patients with COPD (10 with bronchiectasis versus 10
        without) in stable state during their outpatient visits.
