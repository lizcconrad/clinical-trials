  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib citrate and rituximab work in treating patients
      with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows slowly (indolent). Ixazomib citrate may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain
      cells. Giving ixazomib citrate together with rituximab may work better in treating indolent
      B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) as monotherapy in untreated indolent
      B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) based on overall response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate efficacy parameters including the duration of response (DOR), progression-free
      survival (PFS), time to next therapy (TNT), and complete response rate (CR) of ixazomib in
      untreated indolent B-NHL.\

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ixazomib in subjects with B-NHL.

      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ixazomib plus rituximab in subjects with
      B-NHL.

      IV. To evaluate the efficacy parameters including overall response rate (ORR), DOR, TNT, PFS,
      and CR of the combination of rituximab with ixazomib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical and biological prognostic and predictive biomarkers relative to
      treatment outcomes of ixazomib in indolent B-NHL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) once weekly every 4 weeks for up to 24 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of 6 courses
      of ixazomib citrate therapy, patients also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) once weekly.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 5 years.
