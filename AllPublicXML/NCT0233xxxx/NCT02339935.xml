    <textblock>
      This study aims to implement and test a specific brief Applied Behavior Analysis model for
      assessing and responding to severe challenging behavior during acute medical and behavioral
      hospitalization for children with ASD. The investigators will evaluate the impact of this
      program by conducting a randomized trial across both medical and psychiatric hospital
      settings.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline ABC at Hospital Discharge (an expected average of 42 days) and 3-Months Post-Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC is a well-validated measure designed to assess for the presence of clinically significant challenging behavior in the areas of irritability and agitation, lethargy and social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity and noncompliance, and inappropriate speech.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of Patient's Discharge (an expected average of 42 days from admission)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary medical attending, lead discharge nurse staff member, and the child's primary parent will also be asked at discharge to provide both quantitative and qualitative ratings of challenges and successes during hospitalization. Caregivers will be contacted to complete a simple interview/questionnaire 3- months post-hospitalization regarding changes in the patient's medication, medical conditions, residential/classroom placement, emergency room visits or psychiatric hospitalizations since the discharge date, as well as ratings of successes implementing components of the behavioral strategies plan utilized during the hospitalization (if applicable).</description>

    <description>20 Children - 10 hospitalized at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital and 10 hospitalized at Vanderbilt Psychiatric hospital - will receive all typical standard of care procedures while hospitalized, but will not receive Brief AFA</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Brief Analogue Functional Analysis</intervention_name>
    <description>The Brief AFA seeks to identify the function of the challenging behavior by creating controlled test conditions in which specific responses are provided for challenging behavior (e.g., attention, escape from task demands, access to tangible - including variants of each as needed), as well as a control condition in which continual access to attention and preferred items is provided. It consists of a 30-90-minute abbreviated analysis comprised of a single exposure to 2-5-minute test and control conditions, along with replication of applicable test conditions and a treatment probe, which provides evidence of challenging behavior function faster than other methods.</description>
