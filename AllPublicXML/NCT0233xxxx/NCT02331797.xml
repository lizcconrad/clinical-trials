    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgery is becoming more common in many surgical fields. The wide view of
      endoscope allows for minimally invasive transcanal approach instead of large postauricular
      opening. The investigators conduct this study to compared post operative pain score (by
      Visual Analogue Scales) between conventional microscope lateral placing tympanoplasty and
      endoscopic lateral placing tympanoplasty.

      A main part of tympanoplasty is repair of perforated tympanic membrane. There are two popular
      way to approach tympanic membrane, transcanal or postauricular approach. There are two
      grafting techniques are applied in tympanoplasty which includes the lateral technique
      (overlay) and medial technique (underlay).

      The lateral technique is widely used in our institute which involves placement of a graft
      lateral to the tympanic annulus and the fibrous layer of the tympanic remnant. The most our
      preferred approach in previous experience is the postauricular approach for tympanoplasty
      because the transcanal approach is not enough for adequate exposure. Moreover, the
      visualization straight through transcanal provide by the microscope is difficult by a limited
      view of the perforation edge due to narrowing and curved external ear canal. Postauricular
      approach cause many layers of tissue are violated along with a significant postoperative
      pain.

      The author proposed this study with the aim of determining the alleviation of postoperative
      pain by new technique and the efficacy of endoscope for tympanoplasty.
