    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent a widespread health problem that negatively
      affects the quality of life (QoL) of majority of the male aging population. Although LUTS are
      not life threatening, these symptoms include urinary retention, voiding difficulty, frequent
      feeling of urinary urgency, and nocturia, all of which negatively affect the daily functions,
      sleep quality, and sexual activities of patients. Despite the proven effectiveness of
      conventional pharmacological therapies, most men are reluctant to try these treatments
      because of perceived side effects and potential complications. Other non-invasive
      complementary treatments for LUTS should be explored because of the limitations of
      pharmacological therapy.

      Auriculotherapy (AT), one of the approaches in traditional Chinese medicine, is a therapeutic
      method in which specific points in the auricle are stimulated to treat various physical
      disorders. AT is a specialized form of acupuncture in which the ear is viewed as a
      microsystem of the body. A minimally invasive measure of AT, instead of using needles, is
      adopted in this study to avoid pain induction.

      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to determine the effectiveness of AT in improving
      the conditions of the elderly with LUTS in terms of symptom relief, enhancing QoL, and
      improving sleep conditions. Male subjects, who are 60 years old or above and with moderate to
      severe LUTS, will be recruited.

      Subjects in 'Treatment arm 1' will receive MAT and placebo LA on specific auricular points on
      one side of the ear during each treatment session. Subjects in 'Treatment arm 2' will receive
      LA and placebo MAT using low-energy laser applied to selected acupoints of the ear, and a
      plaster centred with a portion of Junci Medulla that mimics MAT treatment will also be given.
      Subjects in 'Treatment arm 3' will receive a combined approach (both MAT and LA). Subjects in
      the 'placebo arm' will serve as placebo controls. Six auricular acupoints that are considered
      to affect LUTS will be selected. Only one ear at a time will receive treatment. Thus, the
      ears will be treated alternately. The total treatment period will be four weeks. The
      experimental objects will be replaced every other day. Therefore, treatment will be performed
      thrice a week. Subjects will be assessed at baseline up to 3 months after the therapy. This
      study can advance our knowledge of complementary approaches to improve the LUTS conditions of
      the elderly population and the feasibility of AT among clients with LUTS in a future
      large-scale study.

      Research hypotheses:

        1. Magneto-auriculotherapy (MAT) or laser auriculotherapy (LA) alone or use in combination
           are more effective than the control treatment in terms of symptom relief in male elderly
           patients suffering from LUTS.

        2. MAT or LA alone or use in combination are more effective than the control treatment in
           terms of enhancement of QoL, and improvement of sleep conditions in male elderly
           patients suffering from LUTS.

      Primary objective To investigate whether MAT or in combination with LAT are more effective
      than the control treatment in terms of symptom relief in male elderly patients suffering from
      LUTS.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To determine whether MAT or in combination with LAT are more effective than the control
           treatment in terms of enhancement of QoL, and improvement of sleep conditions in male
           elderly patients suffering from LUTS;

        2. To assess the feasibility of using AT among LUTS patients in a future large-scale study,
           including the use of blinding, acceptance of treatment protocol, follow-up for
           repetitive testing, estimating effect size and attrition rate.

        3. To compare the treatment effect and the feasibility of this study to be conducted in
           Hong Kong and China Mainland.

      Research plan and methodology Design: This study is a randomized controlled and
      double-blinded feasibility trial.

      Participants and settings.

      In Hong Kong:

      Subjects who are 60 years old or above will be recruited from the community centres or day
      care centres. The therapies will be administered either in the Integrative Health Clinic of
      the School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, or in the elderly centres,
      depending on the subjects' convenience.

      In China:

      Subjects will be recruited by the Nursing College of Zhengzhou University. The inclusion and
      exclusion, therapy administration, and outcome measures will be identical with the study
      conducted in Hong Kong to facilitate comparison.

      All therapies will be administered in a room assigned for research purposes. Only the
      researchers and the subject under treatment will be allowed to stay in the room during the
      therapy. A warning sign for laser radiation will be put up in a visible place outside the
      room for other workers or members of the elderly centres to see.

      Groupings Group 1 (MAT &amp; placebo LAT): Subjects will receive MAT. The magnetic pellets will
      have ~200 gauss/pellet magnetic flux densities on average, with a diameter of 1.76 mm (Figure
      1). The experimental object will be applied to the six selected acupoints as detected by an
      acupoint finder. The Chinese Standard Ear-Acupoints Chart, which is recognized by the World
      Health Organization, is used to locate the reflective zones. These zones are as follows:
      angle of superior concha/prostate, kidney, bladder, ureter, external genitals, and internal
      genitals (Wang, Ceng, Wang, Lin &amp; Wang, 1999). To achieve a blinding and placebo effect of
      the subject, the laser device will be switched to &quot;power off&quot; mode (i.e. deactivated laser)
      for acupoint &quot;stimulation&quot; before the application of MAT. Subjects will be asked to wear a
      pair of laser protective goggles to &quot;blind&quot; them during treatment.

      Group 2 (Combined MAT &amp; LAT): Subjects will receive a combined approach that includes the use
      of MAT and LA. A laser device (Pointer Pulse™) will be used in this study. This device has a
      wavelength of 650 nm, an average output power of 2.5 mW, an energy density of 1 minute with
      0.54 J/cm2, and a pulse of 10 Hz, which is a common acceptable dosage for clinical use (King
      et al., 1990; Round et al., 2013). This application is a low-energy laser therapy (LLLT), in
      which the energy level emitted from the device is approximately comparable to a teaching
      pointer. A 1-minute treatment using the continuous mode of the device will be directly
      applied to the reactive region of each of the six selected acupoints on the ear. Laser
      protective goggles will be provided to the subjects and the researchers for eye protection
      (Figure 2).

      Group 3 (Placebo MAT &amp; placebo LAT): Subjects will serve as a placebo control and will
      receive LAT at &quot;power off&quot; mode (i.e. deactivated laser) for acupoint &quot;stimulation&quot; before
      the application of plasters centred with a small portion of Junci Medulla (mimicking the MAT
      treatment). Junci Medulla is the dried stem of the perennial plant that is soft in texture.
      It has been successfully adopted as a placebo in a previous study conducted by the PI because
      it does not induce any physical pressure on the acupoints of the ear (Suen et al., 2002a).

      Experimental and control interventions Eligible subjects will be randomly and blindly
      allocated to one of the three groups, to be decided by a computer-generated randomised table.
      Restricted randomisation by blocking will be used to ensure approximately similar sample
      sizes for each group at any time during the trial according to equal proportion rule (1:1:1).
      The random allocation sequence will be managed by a specified research assistant (RA) who is
      not involved in this trial and is concealed to the assessors.

    <measure>1. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS - Hong Kong Chinese Version 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>collected at baseline up to 3 months after therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument will be used to collect information regarding the LUTS condition of the subjects. The instrument consists of seven Likert-scale questions [scores from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always)] that will address two aspects of LUTS. Three questions involve filling problems (daytime frequency and nocturnal urgency), and four questions assess voiding problems (emptying, intermittency, weak stream, and straining). The total IPSS score from the seven questions ranges from 0 to 35. The IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2) has been recently validated and found to be a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure for assessing Chinese populations with LUTS (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.71, ICC of the symptom questions = 0.80, ICC of the QoL = 0.70) (Choi et al., 2014). This tool will be set as the primary variable to indicate the actual effect size and continuously monitor the effectiveness of the treatments throughout the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh sleep quality index</measure>
    <time_frame>collected at baseline up to 3 months after therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument will be used to collect data related to the sleep patterns of the subjects. The total PSQI score ranges from 0 to 21, and a PSQI score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. The PSQI has been translated into 55 languages. Chong and Cheung (2012) validated the Cantonese PSQI and reported a high internal consistency of 0.75</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjects' expectations towards therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>collected at baseline up to 3 months after therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A short questionnaire comprising six items is designed to assess patient's expectations towards the therapies that they will be receiving. Questions include which intervention that they think they have received, how strongly they believe that MAT or LA can help them manage their problem and how much faith they have in complementary therapies. The subjects will use a 10-point scale for most items. High scores would indicate high agreement or satisfaction with each item. The subjects will also be asked to describe their expectations for improvement of their LUTS without regarding to treatment using a 7-point Likert Scale with responses ranging from &quot;completely gone&quot; to &quot;much worse&quot;. These items are adapted from existing literature (Kalauokalani et al., 2001; Molassiotis et al., 2013) and are modified for use in this study. This scale will be translated to Chinese and backward translation will be done in order to ensure the original meaning of the item is attained.</description>
