  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized approach/avoidance
      training (AAT) procedure on behavioral, affective, and brain mechanisms that are important
      for reward sensitivity and well-being in individuals diagnosed with major depression. The
      training procedure is designed to modify automatic approach responses for positive social
      stimuli. The primary aim is to determine the effects of approach/avoidance training on the
      functioning of brain systems during reward processing in individuals diagnosed with major
      depression. A secondary aim will determine whether brain activation patterns following
      approach/avoidance training predict subsequent affective and behavioral responses during
      reward processing. An exploratory aim will test whether completing the approach/avoidance
      training procedure in combination with a brief computer-delivered behavioral activation
      program for depression will produce larger changes in depression symptoms, positive emotions,
      and social relationship functioning from pre- to post-intervention compared to the control
      training procedure.
