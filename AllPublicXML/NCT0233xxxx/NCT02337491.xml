    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine the effectiveness of
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given with bevacizumab or when given alone for the treatment of
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study will also test the safety and
      tolerability of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given alone or with bevacizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of
      protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign
      substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory
      for use in treating patients, an antibody that is made in the lab is also known as a
      humanized monoclonal antibody. There are now several approved antibodies for the therapy of
      cancer and other disease. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in
      other types of cancer. Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      may be beneficial in your type of cancer. Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, is approved by
      the FDA for treating recurrent GBM. Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic medicine, which means
      it blocks blood vessels from forming that could supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen.

      There is a safety lead-in to evaluate pembrolizumab in combination of with bevacizumab
      (cohort A) expected to enroll up to 18 participants. Three dose levels (DL) are evaluated for
      pembrolizumab administered at 200 mg (flat dosing) under various dose intervals: every 3 (DL
      0), 4 (DL -1) or 6 (DL -2) weeks. A standard 3+3 design is used starting at DL 0.
      De-escalation may occur depending on observation of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 6
      participants will be evaluated for DLT at DL 0. The Phase II study randomizes participants to
      cohort A: pembrolizumab (using the MTD determined in the safety lead-in) and bevacizumab or
      cohort B: pembrolizumab monotherapy (using the MTD determined in the safety lead-in). Accrual
      goals are established for each cohort: A n=50 and B n=30 participants. The two cohorts are
      evaluated independently against a historical control and not compared. All participants
      treated at the safety lead-in established MTD dose level will be rolled into the Phase II
      cohort.

    <measure>Pembrolizumab Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [Cohort A Safety Lead-In]</measure>
    <time_frame>one cycle/42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD of pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15 and 29 of each 42 day cycle is determined by the number of participants who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the various regimens of dosing frequency of pembrolizumab 200 mg IV administered under evaluation. See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the pembrolizumab dose frequency regimen at which fewer than one-third of participants experience a DLT. If de-escalation does not occur per design, then the starting dose is the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pembrolizumab Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Cohort A Safety Lead-In]</measure>
    <time_frame>The evaluation for MTD occurred continuously through one cycle of treatment (42 days).</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as an adverse event (AE) that (a) is &gt;= grade 3 and related to the pembrolizumab with an attribution of possible, probably or definite, and (b) occurs during and/or begins during the first 42 days of study treatment, and (c) does not meet any of the following exception criteria: grade 3 immune-related AE that downgrades to &lt;= grade 2 within 5 days, or &lt;= grade 1/baseline within 14 days of onset; grade 3 asymptomatic endocrinopathy; grade 3 inflammatory reaction attribution to anti-tumor response; grade 3 pneumonitis, neurologic event, or uveitis that downgrades to &lt;=grade 1 within 3 days; liver transaminase elevation &lt;= 8 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin &lt;= 5 times institutional ULN; any pre-existing lab abnormality that deteriorates to grade 3/4 and determine not clinically significant by Investigator, Overall Principal Investigator and Sponsor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-Month Progression-Free Survival (PFS6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically for response every cycle on treatment. Treatment duration in cycles (cycle=42 days) was a mean (SD) of 4.5 (4.4) for Cohort A and 2.5 (2.7) for Cohort B. Assessment at week 72/cycle 12 pertains to the 6-month PFS.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS6 is the proportion of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 6-months from study entry.
Progressive disease was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. PD is a &gt;25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically for response every cycle on treatment and every 6 weeks long-term. Median PFS follow-up (months) was 25 for Cohort A and 26 for Cohort B.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to the earliest documentation of disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without evidence of PD were censored at the date of last disease assessment. Per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, PD is a &gt;25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed long-term for survival every 3 months from the end of treatment until death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 25 months for each cohort.</time_frame>
    <description>OS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Radiographic Response (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically for response every cycle on treatment. Treatment duration in cycles (each cycle=42 days) was a mean (SD) of 4.5 (4.4) for Cohort A and 2.5 (2.7) for Cohort B.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. RANO criteria has 5 potential categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive disease (PD) and Unknown. CR: disappearance of all enhancing lesions, stable or improved non-enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PR: &gt;= 50% decrease in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, no progression of non-measurable disease, stable or improved non-enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PD: &gt;25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition. SD: does not qualify for CR, PR or PD.</description>

        <description>The MTD of pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15 and 29 of each 42 day cycle is determined by the number of participants who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the various regimens of dosing frequency of pembrolizumab 200 mg IV administered under evaluation. See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the pembrolizumab dose frequency regimen at which fewer than one-third of participants experience a DLT. If de-escalation does not occur per design, then the starting dose is the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).</description>

        <title>6-Month Progression-Free Survival (PFS6)</title>
        <description>PFS6 is the proportion of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 6-months from study entry.
Progressive disease was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. PD is a &gt;25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically for response every cycle on treatment. Treatment duration in cycles (cycle=42 days) was a mean (SD) of 4.5 (4.4) for Cohort A and 2.5 (2.7) for Cohort B. Assessment at week 72/cycle 12 pertains to the 6-month PFS.</time_frame>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to the earliest documentation of disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without evidence of PD were censored at the date of last disease assessment. Per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, PD is a &gt;25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiographically for response every cycle on treatment and every 6 weeks long-term. Median PFS follow-up (months) was 25 for Cohort A and 26 for Cohort B.</time_frame>

        <description>ORR was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. RANO criteria has 5 potential categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive disease (PD) and Unknown. CR: disappearance of all enhancing lesions, stable or improved non-enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PR: &gt;= 50% decrease in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, no progression of non-measurable disease, stable or improved non-enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PD: &gt;25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition. SD: does not qualify for CR, PR or PD.</description>
