    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the no-touch saphenous vein grafts that
      were used in coronary artery bypass surgery between 2003-2008 had a patency rate comparable
      to the left internal thoracic artery when the vein grafts were anatomised to the left
      anterior descending artery.

        All patients that performed coronary artery bypass surgery between 2003-2008 and received a
        no-touch saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery were included
