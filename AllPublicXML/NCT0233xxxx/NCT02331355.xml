      There is an urgent need to develop hand transplant programs in this country. To this end, the
      University of Michigan Hospital and Health Systems is developing such an interdisciplinary
      program. The Transplant Center would like to track the patient experience from pre-operative
      care through surgery and post-operative care.

      Detailed information will be collected from the patient medical records, including:
      Pre-operative screening, demographics, medications; Surgical information ; Post-operative
      inpatient and out-patient care; laboratory and other test results; physical assessments,
      psychological assessments and quality of life assessments.

      Vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation (VCA) is the transplantation of multiple
      tissues containing skin, muscle, bone, joint, cartilage, nerve, tendon, vessels. VCA is
      useful for functional restoration of patients with severe tissue loss as encountered with
      massive burns, traumatic injuries, congenital anomalies, and following tumor resection. VCA,
      and specifically hand transplantation, combines the technical excellence of hand
      surgery/microsurgery with the complex multidisciplinary care rendered in modern solid organ
      transplantation. The technical demands of hand transplantation, enhanced donor antigen burden
      of the hand allograft, and complex psychosocial issues pertaining to the recipient account
      for much of the discrepancy between these 2 related fields.

      Detailed information will be collected from the patient medical records, including:
      Pre-operative screening, demographics, medications; surgical information ; post-operative
      inpatient and out-patient care; laboratory and other test results; physical assessments,
      psychological assessments and quality of life assessments.

      Specific outcomes will include allograft survival, allograft rejection, allograft
      functionality, and quality of life from transplant through 5 years.
