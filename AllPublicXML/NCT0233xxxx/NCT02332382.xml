      The research subject

      Health organizations around the world have determined that breastfeeding is the most critical
      source of nutrition for newborns in the first weeks and months of their lives. A mother's
      breast milk contains unique nutritious components and other nonnutritive elements that help
      promote healthy baby growth and development (1, 2). Recent studies show that a mother's
      breast milk contains components that vary from each specimen. There are great evidences that
      maternal and environmental factors have a strong influence on the composition of breast milk.
      Fatty acids, the second most common component found in breast milk, show extreme sensitivity
      to maternal nutrition (3, 4).

      Latest studies show that breast milk also contains bacterial communities that may have health
      implications of newborn. The structure of these bacterial communities also varied greatly
      between subjects (5) .

      In the research, we propose to investigate the connection between maternal nutrition,
      different fatty acids and their role in the growth and development of bacterial populations
      existing in breast milk.
