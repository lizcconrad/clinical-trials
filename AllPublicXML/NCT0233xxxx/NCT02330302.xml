  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are common in our elderly population and is associated with pain before and
      after surgery. The current pain management for patients who have undergone surgery for hip
      fractures include a combination of oral painkillers, opioids (eg morphine) and regional
      anaesthesia techniques, which involves the injection of local anaesthetic drugs near nerves
      supplying the hip joint to numb the operation site. As opioids have many side effects,
      especially in the elderly patients, regional anaesthesia techniques can help to reduce the
      use of opioids and the related side effects. This may enhance their recovery and length of
      hospital stay
