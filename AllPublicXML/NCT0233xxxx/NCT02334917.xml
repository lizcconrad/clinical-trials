  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to assess equivalence of scar outcome for two absorbable
      sutures used for wound closure on the face in dermatologic surgery: rapidly absorbable
      polyglactin 910 (VicrylRapideâ„¢) and fast-absorbing plain gut (5-0 fast). This is important
      because absorbable sutures are commonly used in Mohs surgery for epidermal closure, yet there
      is no evidence indicating if any of the sutures above allow for a better cosmetic outcome
      (less erythema, edema, and scarring).

      Prospective randomized controlled split-scar observer-blinded study.

      After dermatologic surgery on the face, surgeons have a choice between using non-absorbable
      or absorbable sutures for skin closure. A dermatologic surgeon favoring absorbable sutures
      for wound closure will consider many factors in material selection, including ease of
      manipulation, cost, and absorption time. However, there have been no randomized trials
      comparing the most important measure: aesthetic/cosmetic outcome.

      Study endpoint/outcome: use three validated scar assessment tools.

    <description>In this study we will use three validated scar assessment tools (the Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES) to assess scar width, height, color, cross-hatching and overall appearance, the Wound Evaluation Scale (WES) to rate scar stepoff, contour irregularity, scar width, edge inversion, and inflammation , and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)) to assess overall scar appearance. This will be done at the one-week, two-month and six-month post-operative follow-ups.</description>
