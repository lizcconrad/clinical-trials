      Measuring and logging head positions of patients which underwent surgery with
      gasendotamponades.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After surgery with gasendotamponades various positions are recommended to support the success
      of surgery. In patients with macular holes face-down-position is recommended. In patients
      with retinal detachment the recommended position depends on the region of the detachment.

      The adherence of patients to follow this posturing instructions is very inhomogenous.
      Therefore the investigators want to measure the posturing by the use of a position-sensor. In
      some study arms the patients also receive a feedback from the sensor (tone, vibration) to
      correct the position.

      The sensor-device was developed by the study-staff and is not commercial available. In
      addition there is no trade name. The patients safety of the used device was approved by the
      in house technical department.
