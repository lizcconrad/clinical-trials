  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common incurable blood cancer causing debilitating symptoms-bone
      pain, kidney failure, low blood counts and infection. Chemotherapy outcomes are disappointing
      due to short-term response and long-term toxicities.

        1. Studies showed these patients have weak immune against MM due to the immune checkpoint
           mediated by the PD1/PD-L1 interaction between immune cells and MM. Anti-PD-1 antibody
           (anti-PD1) disrupts this interaction, thus unleashing immune cell function and leading
           to killing of MM cells.

        2. Studies further showed enhancement of this &quot;unleash&quot; after autologous transplant and
           better MM control by anti-PD1 when used after transplant.

        3. Anti-PD1 has been extensively studied in patients with other cancers. It is very safe
           and effective and has been FDA-approved. Complications are of mild degree and easy to
           manage successfully in out-patient setting. Severe complications are rare.

      Thus, we are proposing an efficacy study of anti-PD1 treatment after transplant to improve MM
      treatment outcomes. This is a collaborative study with Medical College of Wisconsin
      (headquarter of Center for International blood and Marrow Transplant Research). We
      hypothesized that anti-PD1 treatment will increase the MM response and the MM control
      duration when it is added to the standard MM treatment after transplant. Anti-PD1 will be
      given at the dose and interval, which had been studied previously (200 mg intravenous
      injection every 3 weeks) between 2 weeks until 6 months after transplant. Subjects will be
      monitored closely during and after anti-PD1 therapy until at least 1 year post transplant.
      Late complications will be followed until 3 years.
