  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if drinking extra water helps people prevent or
      relieve headaches and hunger and, if so, what volume of water is most effective and when is
      it best to drink it?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If participants decide to participate in this trial, they will be asked to drink a specific
      amount of water at particular times of the day for 14 days. A computer will decide by chance
      the amount of water they will be asked to drink each day of the trial and the times at which
      to drink this.

      There are different amounts and different times that people will be asked to drink water,
      this is so that the investigators can find out if there is an optimal volume of water to
      drink, and a best time to drink water to reduce headaches or hunger. The least amount of
      water the computer could ask participants to drink is half a glass (that is 4oz or 120ml).
      The largest volume of water the computer could ask participants to drink would be eight
      glasses of water a day (a total of 64oz or 2L) spread across the day (that is not all at
      once). Once the computer has assigned participants to a particular volume and times to drink
      water, these will remain the same for every day throughout the study.

      Participants will be asked to provide some brief information about themselves at the
      beginning of the study (for example, age, sex, height and whether you exercise, smoke or
      not). During the study they will be asked to weigh themselves and record this, Their dietary
      habits and the amount they drink will be kept on a private and confidential page on the study
      website. They will be asked to fill in [2] confidential short surveys about how they feel and
      their views, one at the start and one at the end of the study.
