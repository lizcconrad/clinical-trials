  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma; pembrolizumab will be given as monotherapy to participants who have had
      previous treatment or who are treatment-naïve; pembrolizumab will also be evaluated as
      combination therapy with cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or (Japan only) capecitabine in
      treatment-naïve participants. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will provide
      a clinically meaningful Overall Response Rate (ORR).

      This study will have 3 cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 will run simultaneously; Cohort 3 will start
      when biomarker assay validation is complete. In Cohort 1, participants who have received at
      least two prior therapies for their advanced disease will receive monotherapy with
      pembrolizumab. In Cohort 2, participants who have not received any previous therapy for their
      disease will receive pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or (Japan only)
      capecitabine. In Cohort 3, participants who have not received any previous therapy and who
      have programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors will receive pembrolizumab
      monotherapy.
