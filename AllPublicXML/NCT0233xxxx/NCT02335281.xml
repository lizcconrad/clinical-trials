  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many limitations in the current treatments of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Now
      the investigators realized that the intestinal microecological is closely associated with the
      development of IBD. So the standardized fecal microbiota transplantation is considered to be
      simple but effective emerging therapies for the treatment of IBD. In this project the
      investigators intend to carry out a single-center, randomized, single-blind clinical
      intervention study. The investigators will recruit 40 patients with IBD (20 cases of
      Ulcerative Colitis and 20 cases of Crohn's disease) in China. The patients will be randomly
      divided into 2 groups, one group will be given treatment of standardized fecal microbiota
      transplantation, the other will be simply treated with mesalazine, followed up for at least 1
      year. The investigators propose to determine the efficiency, durability and safety of
      Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for IBD treatment.

      In this projects the investigators aim to re-establish a gut balance of intestinal
      microecological through Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for IBD (UC and CD). We
      will establish a standardized isolation, store, and transportion steps of fecal bacteria from
      donated fresh stool in the laboratory. Then the bacteria will be transplanted to mid-gut by
      nose-jejunum nutrition tube. Patients in this study will be assigned to receive standardized
      FMT only once or traditional medicine of mesalazine and would be followed up for at least 1
      year. The clinical symptoms, sign, blood tests, abdominal CT, endoscopy and questionnaire
      will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of Standardized FMT at the start
      and end of the projects.
