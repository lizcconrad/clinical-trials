    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, safety and tolerability study of continuous
      apomorphine infusion in subjects with advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) whose motor
      fluctuations remain unsatisfactory with levodopa (or levodopa/carbidopa) and at least one
      other class of drugs or mode of therapy for PD.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study will assess the long-term safety and tolerability
      of continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD)
      patients whose motor fluctuations remain unsatisfactory with levodopa (or levodopa/carbidopa)
      and at least one other class of drugs or mode of therapy for PD.

      Further, this study will assess the clinical effectiveness of continuous apomorphine
      subcutaneous infusion in reducing &quot;off&quot; time in advanced PD patients and to assess the
      clinical effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine in improving &quot;on&quot;
      time without resulting in an increase in troublesome dyskinesias.
