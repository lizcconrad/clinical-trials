      BACKGROUND: The literature has shown that simplified methods for complete denture fabrication
      can be as effective as the traditional techniques, but with less expenditure of time and
      resources, without prejudice to the patients. However, the effectiveness of these simplified
      methods for patients with more complex medical conditions haven't been deeply explored.

      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed simplified method for complete
      dentures fabrication for patients with severely resorbed mandibular alveolar bones.

      METHOD: edentulous patients requesting treatment with bimaxillary complete dentures in a
      university clinic will be rehabilitated following a simplified technical proposal, being
      divided randomly into two groups according to the mandibular arch molding technique. In group
      A, a single impression with alginate through pre-fabricated trays will be performed, while
      patients allocated in group B will receive a second molding with a more complex technique.
      After 3 and 6 months, besides important clinical parameters, it will be investigated aspects
      related to patient's perceptions about the success of treatment. The study will be conducted
      with a minimum of 30 participants per group, and comparisons between the two groups will be
      made by means of tests suitable for distribution of data.

    <description>The application of a simplified denture fabrication technique will be tested for patients presenting severely resorbed mandibular alveolar bones according to the following steps:
Obtainment of maxillary and mandibular casts by using irreversible hydrocolloid in stainless steel stock trays for record bases fabrication.
Adjustment of record bases according to vertical dimension and centric relation measurements, with no use of facebow transfer. Casts will be mounted in semi-adjustable articulator using standardized measures and artificial teeth will be selected.
Trial dentures will be evaluated for esthetics and maxillomandibular relationship.
Insertion of finished dentures.</description>

    <description>The importance of a second impression for denture fabrication technique will be tested for patients presenting severely resorbed mandibular alveolar bones according to the following steps:
Maxillary and mandibular casts obtained by using irreversible hydrocolloid in stainless steel stock trays for maxillary record base and mandibular custom tray fabrication.
Mandibular second impression with border molding using compound and impression rubber in custom tray.
Record bases adjustments without facebow transfer. Casts will be mounted in semi-adjustable articulator using standardized measures and artificial teeth will be selected.
Trial dentures will be evaluated for esthetics and maxillomandibular relationship.

    <description>Both arm groups are composed by patients present severely resorbed mandibular alveolar bones who will receive complete dentures fabricated by means of a simpler techinique previously proved to be effective. Although for the &quot;traditional protocol&quot; group a second more complex impression step will be performed in order to evaluate if the simpler approach for this anatomical condition could be safely applied.</description>
