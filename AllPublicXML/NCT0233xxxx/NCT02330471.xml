  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized clinical trial of 120 women undergoing large loop excision of the
      transformation zone (LLETZ)-conization for cervical dysplasia, two coagulation modes, spray
      versus forced coagulation, will be compared. The primary outcome of the study is time to
      complete hemostasis, secondary outcomes are intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain,
      and postoperative bleeding complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative bleeding during large loop excision of the transformation zone
      (LLETZ)-conization can be achieved by two modes of electrocoagulation, spray coagulation and
      forced coagulation. Spray coagulation is a superficial coagulation mode, whereas forced
      coagulation is a deep tissue coagulation mode. It is unknown, whether spray or forced
      coagulation is superior regarding intraoperative hemostasis and other outcome Parameters such
      as postoperative bleeding and postoperative pain. Therefore, the investigator designed a
      randomized clinical trial of 120 women undergoing large loop excision of the transformation
      zone (LLETZ)-conization for cervical dysplasia, comparing the two coagulation modes, spray
      coagulation and forced coagulation, The primary outcome of the study is time to complete
      hemostasis measured in seconds, secondary outcomes are intraoperative blood loss measured as
      difference in serum hemoglobin pre- and postoperatively, postoperative pain according to a 10
      step VAS scale, and postoperative bleeding complications, defined as necessity to intervene
      surgically for vaginal bleeding up to 14 days postoperatively. The study Population consists
      of women undergoing LLETZ-conization for histologically proven cervical dysplasia. The study
      hypothesis states that the difference in the mean time until complete hemostais will be at
      least 1/3 shorter in women randomized to spray coagulation. With a study Population of 120
      women, this study has a power of &gt;80% to detect a difference of 1/3 of the mean coagulation
      time until complete hemostais based on an anticipated mean time of 85 seconds.
