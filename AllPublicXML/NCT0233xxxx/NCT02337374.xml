      Purpose The aim of this study is to investigate the contribution of preoperative urodynamics
      to mid-urethral slings (MUS) success for developing an algorithm that uses conventional and
      easily accessible tools Methods Women with stress urinary incontinence and who desired
      surgical correction of their incontinence were included in the study. The selection of the
      procedure was according to an algorithm used in an institution developed by a chief of
      urogynecology department who had 25 years of urogynecology experience. Urodynamic and
      baseline factors that may be associated with surgery failure were analyzed in MUS failure.
