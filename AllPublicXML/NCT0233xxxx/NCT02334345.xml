  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy may cause severe skin changes that significantly interfere with the patient's
      quality of life and may reduce radiotherapy effectiveness. Many skin care instructions and
      various topical agents are recommended to help patients in the management of radiation skin
      reactions, but evidence to support the value of the topical treatments of the irradiated skin
      is lacking. In the present study we investigated the effects of two topical agents used as
      supportive care to protect skin during radiotherapy.

      Women with breast cancer and were to receive breast radiotherapy to 50 Gy were enrolled in a
      prospective randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of Evoskin®) for protecting skin
      compared to Trixiera. To account for individual differences in radiation each subject served
      as her own control, as each was to apply the experimental and control agents to the
      irradiated breast. Each patient was randomly assigned to use Evoskin on the half of the
      irradiated breast and to use the Triexiera on the other half. Dermatitis was graded weekly by
      means of a spectrophotometer.
