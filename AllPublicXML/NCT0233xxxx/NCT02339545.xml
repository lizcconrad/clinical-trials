      This is an acute, observational, prospective, multi-center clinical study to evaluate
      Coronary Flow Reserve using the Volcano FloWire® after treatment with Orbital Atherectomy and
      stenting of de-novo severely calcified lesions due to Coronary Artery Disease. 15 subjects
      will be enrolled in up to 3 active U.S. study sites. Subjects who undergo successful
      revascularization using Orbital Atherectomy and stenting will be eligible for enrollment. All
      enrolled subjects will be treated with the OAS and stenting and seen at 24 hours or at
      discharge, whichever is earlier. The purpose of the study is to evaluate coronary artery flow
      reserve following successful treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions with the OAS
      and stenting.

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) affects over 16 million subjects in the United States, making
      it the most common form of heart disease. The American Heart Association 2010 Update on Heart
      Disease and Stroke Statistics reported that in 2006 an estimated 1,313,000 inpatient
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures were performed in the United Sates.
      Despite advances in interventional equipment and techniques, there are still patient
      populations who remain challenging to treat. One of those patient subsets consists of
      individuals with lesions that have calcium deposits. Up to 50% of stents deployed in
      calcified lesions were found to have asymmetric stent expansion. Research has also shown that
      an increased amount of calcium deposits leads to a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac
      events (MACE) when compared to non-calcified lesions.In addition, lesion calcification has
      been shown to be associated with vessel dissection during PCI, failure to deliver a stent,
      balloon ruptures, and un-dilatable lesions. Unlike PTCA and stenting procedures where the
      calcified lesion is cracked and the stenotic lesion materials are crushed into the arterial
      walls, atherectomy procedures remove the stenotic lesion materials, especially the calcified
      portion of the lesion. Removing, as opposed to displacing, stenotic material may potentially
      lead to reduced acute vascular traumas, lessen the stimulus for neointimal hyperplasia that
      is commonly associated with in- stent restenosis, and facilitate stent delivery and
      expansion. Adequate plaque preparation or modification may improve both acute and long term
      outcomes in subjects with complex lesions, especially heavily calcified lesions.

      Measurement of coronary flow reserve (CFR) using the Volcano FloWire can assess physiological
      changes in the distal vascular bed. The primary endpoint of this study will evaluate coronary
      flow reserve after successful treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions using OAS and
      stent deployment. The secondary endpoint will measure the occurrence of post-procedural Major
      Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), including Cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (Q wave
      or non-Q wave), or target vessel revascularization.
