  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop a pre-clinical platform of melanoma and head and
      neck squamous cell cancer that will allow the investigators to learn more about these
      diseases and discover better and more individualized treatments.

      The main objective of this study is to establish a humanized animal model. Investigators will
      consent patients who have melanoma and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and agree
      to take part in this research study. They will obtain peripheral hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSC), blood and tumor tissue at baseline from blood and tumor samples from these patients
      for use in establishing tumor explants in humanized mice. Therapy results on humanized mice
      will be correlated with existing or newly acquired efficacy results from those same
      immune-based or other therapies in patients. A secondary objective is to identify
      pharmacodynamic markers associated with each drug and biomarkers for evidence of efficacy or
      lack of thereof. Where possible, subjects receiving therapy with FDA-approved drugs of
      interest will be asked to provide sequential blood and tumor biopsies to study the molecular
      and immune events that may occur as a result of drug therapy.
