      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of metformin hydrochloride when
      given together with enzalutamide in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not
      responded to previous treatment with hormones. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight
      prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgens the body makes and blocking the use of
      androgens by the tumor cells. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes, may also help kill
      tumor cells. Giving enzalutamide together with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of enzalutamide when given in combination
      with metformin (metformin hydrochloride) to patients with castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC), where fewer than 33% of patients experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
      attributable to the study regimen and to recommend a phase II dose for the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients with CRPC with given
      enzalutamide in combination with metformin.

      II. To determine PSA progression in patients with CRPC with given enzalutamide in combination
      with metformin.

      III. To investigate the feasibility and safety of enzalutamide when given in combination with
      metformin hydrochloride to patients with CRPC.

      IV. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy for this combination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies of metastatic soft tissue or bone
      tumor tissue for analysis of androgen receptor (AR) gene signature as an integrated biomarker
      (University of California San Francisco [UCSF] to conduct analysis).

      II. To collect serum samples for the measurement of PSA levels and bone re-absorption
      markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of metformin hydrochloride.

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and metformin hydrochloride PO
      twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

             Gleason score available or interpretable; patients must have prostate cancer deemed to
             be castration-resistant by one or more of the following criteria (despite androgen
             deprivation and anti-androgen withdrawal when applicable):

               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug

               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and within 42 days for
                  imaging studies (e.g, bone scans)

               -  NOTE: rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be

                  should be taken at least 7 days after the reference value; a third confirmatory
                  PSA measure (2nd beyond the reference level) should be greater than the second
                  measure, and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure; if this

             that the lesion has progressed following radiation; patients must have at least one
             measurable lesion outside the previously irradiated region in order to be considered
             to have measurable disease
