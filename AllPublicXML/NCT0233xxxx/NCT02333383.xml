    <textblock>
      This is a prospective mono-country, multi-center study in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
      subjects treated with Adalimumab. At least 200 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 10
      sites. The baseline assessment should be performed prior to the first dose of Adalimumab.
      Study visit will be conducted at 12, 28, 36 and 52 week after baseline. All subjects will
      have one follow-up approximately 70 days after last dose of Adalimumab.
