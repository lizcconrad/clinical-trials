      The primary objective of the study was to assess the gastric residence time (GRT) of the
      Soctec capsule after a standardized breakfast. 12 healthy subjects will undergo an initial
      screening visit. Eligible subjects will undergo the study procedure. The hypothesis is that
      the GRT of the Soctect Capsule after a standardized breakfast and lunch will be longer
      compared to literature values reported for a simliar sized capsule.
