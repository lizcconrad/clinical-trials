  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute or chronic HCV infection can lead to liver complications, including liver failure,
      cirrhosis or liver cancer. For patients with hepatitis C infection, the major clinical
      question remains the terms of treatment initiation. In Europe, new treatments are available
      since the approval of three direct acting antivirals. However with the high cost of these
      treatments, they are currently only available for critically ill patients. Other molecules
      are currently in advanced clinical development phases. The use of clinical predictors remains
      relevant for the selection of a suitable treatment for each patient, in particular to limit
      the adverse effects and reduce costs. Currently the quantification of viral load is a measure
      of response to treatment; with the recommendation to stop treatment in patients who fail to
      achieve an undetectable level of viral load. Genetic factors have also been identified as
      predictors of response to treatment, in particular polymorphisms of the IL-28B gene.
      Genotyping of this gene is currently performed using classical PCR amplification applied to
      DNA extracted from blood, with a time to result of 2-3 weeks. We propose in this protocol to
      test a non-invasive method and rapid test for IL-28B genotype which could be used for point
      of caring testing, and ultimately better patient management.

      This is a monocenter, cross-sectional study among HCV chronic patients. The study will be
      conducted in 250 HCV patients, all viral genotypes combined, at Cochin Hospital (Paris,
      France).

      Objectives The principal objective is to assess the accuracy of the newly developed
      Point-of-Care genotyping assay (Genedrive® IL-28B Assay) to detect in HCV patients the
      genotype CC versus non CC (i.e. CT and TT) against the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay as
      gold standard.

      The secondary objective is to assess the concordance between the genotype results of the
      Genedrive and the gold standard regarding the three genotypes CC, CT and TT.
