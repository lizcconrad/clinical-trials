      The purpose of this study is to determine whether autologous T cells bearing chimeric antigen
      receptor that can specifically recognize EGFR overexpressed in tumor cells is safe and
      effective for patients with EGFR-overexpressing malignant glioma.

      BACKGROUND:

      - Patients with advanced gliomas have very limited treatment options. Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) is often amplified in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and has been regarded
      a suitable target for GBM treatment.

      The investigators have constructed lentiviral vector that contains a chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) that recognizes overexpressed EGFR in tumor cells but not EGFR in normal
      cells, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this CAR with high efficiency without
      the need to perform any selection.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objectives To evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-EGFR CAR engineered T
      lymphocytes in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, and aldesleukin

      Secondary objectives To determine whether the glioma will regress after the patients receive
      anti-EGFR CAR-engineered T lymphocytes and aldesleukin following a nonmyeloablative but
      lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Histologically proven glioblastoma or glisarcoma overexpressing EGFR as determined by IHC,
      Western blot, FISH or RT-PCR.

      Failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Cardiac,
      pulmonary and laboratory parameters within acceptable limits

      DESIGN:

      The study will be conducted using a Phase I design. Patients will receive a non-myeloablative
      but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, CAR gene-transduced T cells, plus
      IV aldesleukin.

      A total of 10 patients may be enrolled over a period of 1-2 years.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven glioblastomas or gliosarcomas that overexpress
             EGFR as assessed by IHC, FISH, western blot or RT-PCR.

          2. Patients must have progression of disease after radiotherapy (including patients that
             undergo surgery for recurrent disease and are rendered NED). This includes recurrent
             GBM after receiving all standard first-line treatment, including surgery (if feasible
             due to neurosurgical and neuro-anatomical considerations) and adjuvant radiotherapy
             +/- chemotherapy.

          3. Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose of steroids for
             at least five days prior to registration.

          4. Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to
             age 70, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks

          5. Patients must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

          6. Must be willing to sign a durable power of attorney.

          7. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control for four months
             following treatment.

          8. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

          9. Serology:

             Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.) Seronegative for hepatitis B
             antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence
             of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         10. Hematology WBC greater than or equal to 3000/mm(3) ANC greater than or equal to
             1000/mm(3) without the support of filgrastim Platelet count greater than or equal to
             100,000/mm(3) Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dl (eligibility level for
             hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion)

         11. Chemistry:

             ALT/AST less than or equal to to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal Creatinine less
             than or equal to to 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less than or equal to to 1.5 mg/dl,
             except in patients with Gilbert s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than
             3.0 mg/dl.

         12. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from radiation therapy. Additionally, patients must
             be at least 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 4 weeks from temozolomide, 3 weeks from
             procarbazine, 2 weeks from vincristine and 4 weeks from last bevacizumab
             administration. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from other cytotoxic therapies not
             listed above and 2 weeks for non-cytotoxic agents (e.g., interferon, tamoxifen)
             including investigative agents. All toxicities from prior therapies should be resolved
             to CTCAE less than or equal to grade 1 (except for toxicities such as alopecia, or
             vitiligo).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A prior history of gliadel implantation in the past six months..

          2. Women who are currently pregnant or breast feeding because of the potentially
             dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          3. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses
             including those of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease.

          4. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          5. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity to any of the agents including
             cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin.

          7. History of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms.

          8. Clinically significant hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, including transient ischemic
             attacks and other central nervous system bleeding in the preceding 6 months that were
             not related to glioma surgery. History of prior intratumoral bleeding is not an
             exclusion criteria; patients who with history of prior intratumoral bleeding, however,
             need to undergo a non-contrast head CT to exclude acute bleeding.

          9. Other concomitant anti-cancer therapy except corticosteroids.

         10. Any patient known to have an LVEF less than or equal to 45%.
