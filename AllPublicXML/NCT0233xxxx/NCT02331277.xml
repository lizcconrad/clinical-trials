    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of BI 655064 following weekly subcutaneous injection for 4 weeks in healthy Chinese
      male volunteers.

      The secondary objective is the exploratory evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of BI 655064 following weekly subcutaneous injection for 4
      weeks in healthy Chinese male volunteers.

                  their female partners (if of childbearing potential) agree to use any of the
                  following adequate contraception methods: implants, injectables, combined oral
                  contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD) from the date of screening until at

             of thromboembolism for example because of a personal history and/or a first degree
             relative with a personal history with onset under the age of 55 of significant
             thromboembolism, including but not limited to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary
             embolism, cortical sinus thrombosis, coronary and cerebrovascular events, and
