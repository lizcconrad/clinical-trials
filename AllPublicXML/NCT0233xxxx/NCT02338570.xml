    <textblock>
      Evaluation of unfavourable outcome-related factors in patients affected by renal cell cancer
      in treatment with everolimus and previously treated with a Vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) inhibitor (i.e. sunitinib, sorafenib,pazopanib, or bevacizumab+interferon)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predictive factors to be considered are: histology, Heng risk group, Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS), site of metastases, glycemia and
      cholesterolemia.

      The data collected in this &quot;real life&quot; population could contribute to identify clinical
      factors that predict favourable outcomes in patients treated with everolimus after failure or
      a a first-line treatment with a VEGF inhibitor.

    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To identify factors predictive of a favourable outcome, in terms of survival free from an unfavourable event, in patients treated with everolimus as second line treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). A favourable outcome is being alive and on treatment without both disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) and HRQoL deterioration (7-point decrease from baseline evaluation on the EQ-5D VAS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS) of everolimus as second line treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>health related quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by EQ-5D questionnaire. It will be described at each time by using summary statistical measures for continuous variables</description>

    <measure>drug-related toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.03.
The frequency of maximum toxicity grade experienced by each patient for each specific toxicity will be presented as well as the frequency of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 (grade 2 for neurotoxicity) events, and SADRs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment compliance will be assessed by evaluating the dose intensity (total dose divided by duration of exposure to treatment in weeks), and calculating the frequencies and proportion of patients who modified or interrupted the treatment.</description>
