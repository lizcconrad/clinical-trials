  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) belong to the sarcoma group and are characterized by
      oncogenic mutations in the c-KIT, PDGFRA, BRAF and NF-1 genes that drive tumor growth. Since
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become available, the median survival of GIST patients
      increased from 9 months to over 5 years. Consequently, this rare disease has become a role
      model for other targeted therapies. However, response to TKIs is extremely heterogeneous:
      ~15% of the patients experience no benefit from imatinib, whereas ~17% of the patients enjoy
      stable disease for over 9 years. Treatment failure due to primary and secondary resistance is
      caused in part by mutations in oncogenic genes that cause change in drug sensitivity. A new
      technique, using circulating tumor DNA, has enabled us to assess mutations in a simple blood
      sample obtained from patients on treatment, and thus detect new mutations early in the course
      of the disease. Also, differences in pharmacokinetic drug behavior add to the observed
      heterogeneity, and may cause resistance due to drug underexposure and thereby proliferation
      of the least sensitive tumor cells. This offers the opportunity to optimize and personalize
      targeted treatment for individual GIST patients by timely treatment adaptation based on early
      detection of secondary TKIs resistance mutations. Achieving this urgently requires data on
      daily clinical practice, including prospective serial mutation analysis and serial drug
      plasma concentration measurement. At a fundamental level this will also help to unravel the
      driving factors behind primary and secondary TKIs resistance in this model disease.

      The treatment of Dutch GIST patients is centralized: almost all patients are referred to one
      of the five collaborating centers forming the Dutch GIST consortium, UMCG, NKI-AvL, Radboud
      UMC, Erasmus MC and LUMC. To further optimize treatment for all patients, these centers have
      implemented a standard-of-care diagnostic and treatment plan that assures collection of
      homogenous phenotypic and treatment data for the bio-databank. The consortium is supported by
      and works in close collaboration with the Dutch sarcoma and GIST patient organizations.

      A prospective, longitudinal bio-databank will be set up. Data regarding multi-morbidity, drug
      pharmacokinetics and serial tumor genotypic data will be collected prospectively from all
      (new) GIST patients during TKI treatment. Our standard-of-care plan includes primary tumor
      mutation analysis, performed by pathology laboratories on site. At each follow up visit
      during treatment, blood will be collected to assess TKI plasma exposure and to perform
      mutation analysis on circulating tumor DNA. All patients will be followed for tumor RECIST
      1.1 progression assessed by CT scans and asked to undergo a tumor biopsy at progression to
      detect secondary resistance mutations.

      The development of a model predicting secondary imatinib resistance based on patient
      phenotype and tumor genotype, will be achieved by analyzing GIST patients with progressive
      disease on imatinib (index patients; n=30) in our bio-databank. These patients will be
      matched 1:1 with non-progressive patients treated for the same duration as the index
      patients. Regarding the index patients, next-generation gene-targeted mutation analysis will
      be performed on archival tumor material and on a tumor biopsy at progression to identify
      patient's unique secondary mutations. The mutations that will be studied are: KIT exon 9,
      exon 11, exon 13, exon 14, exon 17 and exon 18; PDGFRA exon 12, exon 14 and exon 18 and BRAF
      exon 10 en exon 15.

      In-depth analysis regarding mutation analysis in circulating tumor DNA and imatinib drug
      concentration assessment will be performed for these 60 patients.

    <description>A bio-databank consisting of TKI drug level and serum for analysis of mutations in circulating tumor DNA will be set up. This bio-databank will be used to study whether changes in the amount of the primary KIT mutation is an early predictor of treatment response and/of failure. Moreover, secondary TKI resistant mutations in circulating tumor DNA will be assessed.
To be able to assess those mutations, a tumor biopsy will be performed at the time of radiologic progressive disease. Vena puncture for blood collection will be performed at routine out patient visits.</description>
