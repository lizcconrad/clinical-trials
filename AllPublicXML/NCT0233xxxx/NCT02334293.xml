      The purpose of this study is to determine if a fat emulsion comprised of omega-3 fatty acids,
      Omegaven, would be beneficial in the management of steatotic liver injury in parenteral
      nutrition (PN) by its inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, the reduction of arachidonic
      acid-derived inflammatory mediators, prevention of essential fatty acid deficiency through
      the presence of small amounts of arachidonic acid, and improved clearance of lipids from the
      serum.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than 14 days old.

          -  Have PN-associated cholestasis defined as at least 2 consecutive direct bilirubin &gt;2
             mg/dL with anatomical or functional short gut (OR &gt;4 mg/dL if intact intestine)
             obtained at least 1 week apart with a ratio of direct: total bilirubin &gt; 0.4.

          -  Patients will be PN dependent (unable to meet nutritional needs solely by enteral
             nutrition) and are expected to require PN for at least 4 more weeks.

          -  Patients must have failed standard therapies for Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver
             Disease (PNALD) including: cycling of PN, avoiding overfeeding, reduction/removal of
             copper and manganese from PN, advancement of enteral feeding, and use of ursodiol
             (i.e. Actigall).

          -  Signed patient informed consent.

          -  The patient is expected to have a reasonable possibility of survival.

          -  No other known etiology of cholestasis other than PNALD at time of Omegaven®
             initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Causes of cholestasis other than PNALD including but not limited to Hepatitis C,
             Cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, and alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, prior to
             Omegaven® initiation.

          -  Known fish or egg allergy

          -  Any of the contraindications to use of Omegaven®:

               1. Active new infection at the time of initiation of Omegaven®

               2. Hemodynamic instability

               3. Use of medications with associated risk of bleeding, including nonsteroidal
                  antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

               4. Active coagulopathy or bleeding

               5. Thrombocytopenia

               6. Unstable hyperglycemia

               7. Impaired lipid metabolism (triglycerides &gt;1000 mg/dL) while on 1 g/kg/day or less
                  of Intralipid

               8. History of severe hemorrhagic disorders (ie. hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease,
                  etc.)

               9. Unstable diabetes mellitus

              10. Collapse and shock

              11. Stroke/ Embolism

              12. Cardiac infarction within the last 3 months

              13. Undefined coma status

          -  Enrollment in a clinical trial involving an investigational agent (unless approved by
             the designated physicians on the multidisciplinary team)

          -  The parent or guardian of child is unwilling to provide consent or assent
