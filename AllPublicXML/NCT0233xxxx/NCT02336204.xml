  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase of overweight and obesity in young Italian people, nowadays showed by several
      epidemiological data, has been related to the misuse of alcohol and to a lack in nutritional
      knowledge.

      Thus the aim of our study was to investigate if different nutritional knowledge from could
      affect body composition and drinking habits of a cohort of local young people.

      104 healthy subjects (56 males and 54 females) were recruited using oral advertisements among
      the students of 18-19 years-old belonging to the Istituto Agrario and the Istituto
      alberghiero Raineri-Marcora of Piacenza. The subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire
      on alcohol consumption and another one related to nutritional knowledge. Then anthropometric
      data were measured: height, weight, waist and hips circumferences, waist-hips ratio and
      skinfolds were evaluated for each subject and body fat mass was calculated.
