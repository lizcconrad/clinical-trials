        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients from 18 to 80

          -  Biopsy-proven EMP with relapsed or refractory Myeloma disease. Patients may be
             proteasome inhibitor-exposed or naive, but cannot be refractory to proteasome
             inhibitor therapy

          -  Disease requiring further treatment

          -  Measurable disease such as M protein and Objective and measurable of EMP

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to
             2

          -  Meet the clinical laboratories criteria as specified in the protocol

          -  Voluntary written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are lactating, breastfeeding or pregnant

          -  Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions as specified in study
             protocol

          -  Requirement for other concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, which
             would be considered as a treatment of EMP.

          -  Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens

          -  Ongoing or active infection, known HIV positive, active hepatitis B or C infection

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications
