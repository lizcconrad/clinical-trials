      The main purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Eliquis® (apixaban) Prescriber Guide
      and Patient Alert Card in terms knowledge of the important identified risk of bleeding
      associated with Eliquis treatment communicated by the RM tools.

      Observational Model, Other- This is a non-interventional, cross-sectional study in the EEA
      involving representative samples of HCPs who treat patients with Eliquis, as well as patients
      treated with Eliquis. This study will be facilitated via web-based surveys used to evaluate
      the effectiveness of the Eliquis Prescribe Guide and Patient Alert Card as risk management
      tools.

      Enrollment: 384 Health Care Professions (HCPs) and 192 Patients

      Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of
      recurrent DVT and PE in adults (VTEt)
