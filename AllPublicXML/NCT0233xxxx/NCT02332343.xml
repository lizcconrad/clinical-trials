    <textblock>
      Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause for severe visual loss in the
      elderly and represents an unmet need. So far no treatment is available for geographic atrophy
      (GA), which represents the advanced dry form characterized by expanding areas of outer
      retinal atrophy with corresponding absolute scotoma. The foveal retina may be spared until
      late in the course of the disease, a phenomenon termed &quot;foveal sparing&quot;. However, the disease
      process ultimately also involves the central retina leading to irreversible loss of central
      vision. While the natural history of eyes with GA has been extensively studied with regard to
      the entire atrophic area, morphology-function analyses for &quot;foveal sparing&quot; GA in particular
      are still missing. Such data are needed for various purposes including the future use in
      interventional pharmacological trials aiming to slow the progression of GA and to preserve
      the foveal retina. In this study, different imaging modalities for accurate detection and
      quantification of preserved foveal retinal areas will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent

          -  The study eye must have a contiguous well-demarcated area of GA either in a complete
             ring around the spared fovea or in a horseshoe pattern with a total atrophy size of ≤
             7 Disk Areas

          -  Patient is willing to undergo ocular examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence or history of CNV (choroidal neovascular membrane) in the study eye

          -  Ocular disease in the study eye that may confound assessment of the retina, other than
             non-exudative AMD (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, uveitis)

          -  Cataract surgery or ocular surgery in the study eye within 30 days prior to the
             baseline visit

          -  Current or previous participation in clinical studies investigating drugs, medical
             devices or supplements within 30 days prior to enrolment in the study - Previous or
             concomitant therapy to reat AMD (investigational or FDA approved); oral supplements of
             vitamins and minerals are permitted

          -  Known medical history of allergy or sensitivity to tropicamide or fluorescein dye that
             is clinically relevant in the investigator's opinion
