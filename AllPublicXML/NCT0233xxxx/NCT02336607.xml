    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on blood pressure control, pulse wave
      velocity, as well as safety and tolerability of felodipine single or combine with other drugs
      in Chinese Hypertension patients.

      In this study, investigators will choose male and female subjects aged between 35 and 79
      years old with mild to moderate essential hypertension. At first 2 weeks, all patients will
      use felodipine 5mg daily. If the blood pressure dosen't meet the target (140/90mmHg), they
      will be randomized into metoprolol, lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide combination groups for
      another 4 weeks therapy. After that, if the blood pressure has still not met the target,
      up-titrate the felodipine into 10mg, followed by a 4 weeks therapy. And if the blood pressure
      is still not met the target after that, up-titrate the combine drugs into maximum dosage. The
      whole treatment duration is 14 weeks.

      The primary outcome is to evaluate the percentage of subjects reaching blood pressure target
      (defined as &lt; 140 / 90 mmHg) after 14 weeks treatment with felodipine sustained release in
      combination with metoprolol, lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide.
