  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade the paradigm of care in oncology has evolved with the advent of
      personalized medicine. Yet, despite this exciting prospect, there are currently only a few
      disease subtypes where therapeutic approaches with proven benefit exist such as EGFR targeted
      therapies in EGFR-mutant lung tumours. With the increasing number of novel molecularly
      targeted agents available, the importance of building our understanding of cancer biology is
      critical.

      Challenges to implement personalized medicine include the limitations of molecular testing,
      tumour heterogeneity and molecular evolution, costs, and the quality and morbidity associated
      with tumour biopsies. Sequential biopsies are essential to better understand biological
      markers of response and resistance, and identify predictive or prognostic markers. Despite
      the scientific rationale for biopsies, incorporating them into practice can be challenging,
      as in many cases there is no direct advantage to the patient. This project aims to understand
      the effect of research biopsies on the patient. The Investigator hypothesize by learning more
      and gaining a better appreciation of the impact on the patient, Investigators will increase
      the likelihood of achieving serial biopsies.

      The ability to obtain serial biopsies is dependent on the patient's experience. To understand
      the clonal progression of cancer and validate predictive and prognostic markers of response,
      studies now target biopsies both at enrollment and at progression. As Investigators strive to
      achieve this, improving our understanding of the patient's experience will help us identify
      factors that positively and negatively impact on patient participation and influence the
      probability of successfully obtaining sequential samples.

      Both primary and secondary objectives will be assessed in a questionnaire. Primary Objectives
      To assess the impact of research biopsies on patients quality of life.

      Secondary Objectives To assess the impact of diagnostic biopsies on quality of life in
      comparison to research biopsies.

      To assess the true complication rates associated with biopsies. To compare types of biopsies
      - surgical versus radiological with respect to implications on quality of life.

      To assess the individual potentially modifiable factors of reason for biopsy; perceived risk;
      perceived benefit; wait time for biopsy; wait time for results; complications; and altruism
      and association with anxiety.

      To determine which factors are associated with a higher and lower likelihood of achieving
      serial biopsies.

        The patient must be 18 years or older with a life expectancy of greater than 3 months. The
        patient must be undergoing a biopsy for research or diagnostic purposes with a diagnosis of
        malignancy or an assumed diagnosis of malignancy. The patient must be able to complete the
        questionnaires independently.

        of greater than 3 months Must be undergoing a biopsy for research or diagnostic purposes.
        Have a diagnosis of malignancy or an assumed diagnosis of malignancy in patients where the
        biopsy is being performed for diagnostic purposes.

        Able to complete questionnaires independently. Ability to understand and the willingness to
        sign a written informed consent document.

        Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Verbal
