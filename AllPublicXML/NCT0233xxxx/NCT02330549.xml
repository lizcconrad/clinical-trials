    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 adult obese subjects (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and suspected NALFD will be randomized into the study.

      Eligible subjects will receive either CVC (n=25) or matching placebo (n=25), once daily (QD)
      for 24 weeks, followed by a safety follow-up visit 4 weeks after last intake of study
      medication.
