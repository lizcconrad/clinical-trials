    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether nasal saline irrigation is beneficial to
      patients undergoing radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, subjects are randomized to one of two study arms. They are either randomized
      to receive nasal saline irrigation treatment (treatment group) or not to receive any nasal
      irrigation treatment (control group). Subjects randomized to the treatment group will be
      provided with saline packets to mix with water. All study subjects will be asked to complete
      questionnaires during the study. If a subject completes all study related activities, their
      total length of participation in the study will last about 2 months.

    <description>Outcome measured using Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) summary scores. Scores will be collected at the baseline visit and again on the Month 2 visit. Outcome represented as a change in mean summary scores between the two visits. Scores can range from 0-5 with 0 being the best and 5 being the worst.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will perform twice daily nasal irrigations. Nasal irrigations will be performed by using premeasured salt packets mixed with distilled water in NeilMed irrigation bottles. The subject will be instructed to lean forward over the sink, place the bottle up to the nostril, and hold their breath while gently squeezing the bottle. One bottle is used to irrigate both nostrils, using half the solution on each side.</description>
