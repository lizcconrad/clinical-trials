      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of oral vibratory stimulus on the
      brain activity and cognitive function of elderly people with non-dementia subjects (cognitive

      Evaluating the effect of oral vibratory stimulus on the brain activity and cognitive function
      of elderly people with mild cognitive impairment

      ◇ Test design: Open-labeled, prospective, pre-post study

      ○ Oral vibratory stimulus: As an optimal algorithm drawn through the first year study, the
      vibratory stimulus is applied 10 times for 15 days (a 5-minute stimulus is applied two times
      a day for 10 days, and it is composed of repeated 15-second vibratory and 15-second
      non-vibratory stimulus with a strength of 3.3V).

    <description>Oral application of vibratory stimulus
: With the oral equipment, which is similar to the device generally used to prevent teeth grinding in dental clinics, 15-second vibratory and 15-second non-vibratory stimulus are given repeatedly for about 5 minutes using a vibrator that has a strength less than or equal to the vibratory stimulus of a smartphone (3.3V, 166Hz, maximum 180Hz). A stimulus of two times for 5 minutes, a total of at least 10 minutes is conducted for 10 days in a hospital or designated place.</description>
