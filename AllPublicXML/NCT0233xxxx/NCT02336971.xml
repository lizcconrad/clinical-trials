  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to enroll 76 couples in which one of the members is a combat-veteran with
      PTSD. Each couple will be randomized into one of two cognitive-behavioral therapies developed
      specifically as a treatment for PTSD—either Prolonged Exposure (PE) [1-4] or
      Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT) [5-7]. Whereas, PE was developed as a one-on-one
      therapy that focuses on treating the individual, CBCT for PTSD incorporates the partners into
      therapy and seeks to directly address relationship functioning while treating the PTSD
      symptomatology. Both partners in each couple will complete a battery of several assessments
      measuring various aspects of psychological distress (e.g., depression, PTSD) and relationship
      functioning at five time-points throughout the study. But, only the partners assigned to the
      CBCT group will be involved in the actual therapy sessions. Analysis will be carried out to
      identify whether any significant differences exist between PE and CBCT in treating PTSD and
      improving relationship functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the effects of Cognitive-Behavioral
      treatments for PTSD on PTSD symptoms and relationship functioning in active duty military
      personnel who have recently returned from combat deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom
      (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), or Operation New Dawn (OND) and their partners.
      Research indicates that PTSD is associated with high levels of relationship distress [8-12].
      We will compare a treatment specifically designed to incorporate partners,
      Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT), with an established therapy that focuses on
      treatment of the individual, Prolonged Exposure (PE). CBCT includes techniques designed both
      to promote support for the traumatized individual and reduce relationship distress; whereas,
      PE focuses solely on PTSD symptoms and treats only the patient with PTSD. Therefore, we
      expect to see greater improvement in intimate relationship functioning with CBCT than with
      PE, while remaining equally effective in reducing PTSD symptomatology. Our specific
      hypotheses are as follows:

        1. Cognitive-Behavioral Couples Therapy (CBCT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) will be equally
           effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, as measured by
           the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the PTSD Checklist -
           Stressor Specific Version (PCL-S).

        2. CBCT for PTSD will be more effective than PE in improving relationship distress in a
           sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and their partners, as measured by the Couples
           Satisfaction Index.

        3. CBCT for PTSD will have significantly greater impact than PE on measures of relationship
           functioning (e.g., intimacy, conflict, aggression) in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans
           and their partners.

    <description>CBCT for PTSD is a time-limited, problem-focused treatment that aims to improve PTSD and relationship functioning. The study investigators have developed a 15-session treatment plan each session lasting 75-minutes.
The treatment is sequenced such that the rationale and psychoeducation provide the basis for the behavioral skills training designed to improve communication and relationship functioning, and to overcome behavioral and experiential avoidance. These skills are used in the final phase of the treatment that is focused on cognitive mechanisms contributing to PTSD and relationship dysfunction.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Prolonged Exposure</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>PE for combat-related stress disorders [13-14] serves as the comparison treatment.
The therapy is usually conducted in 10-12 sessions, each lasting 90-minutes, with the majority of the sessions devoted to imaginal exposure to traumatic memories and homework assignments that include in vivo exposure assignments. In the present study, participants will complete 12 sessions of PE to equate the number of sessions with those of CBCT. Partners of individuals with PTSD are not typically incorporated into the treatment program and so for this study a revised version of PE [1-3] will be administered in which the partner is seen during the second session to discuss PTSD, other reactions to trauma and the treatment procedures.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Married or cohabitating couples who have been together the past 3 months in which
             one partner is an OEF/OIF/OND veteran with PTSD. Diagnosis of PTSD will be determined
             by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). The veteran with PTSD
             must have experienced a Criterion A event that is a specific combat-related event or
             high magnitude operational experience that occurred during a military deployment in
             support of OIF/OEF/OND. The diagnosis of PTSD may be indexed to that event or to
             another Criterion A event.

               -  Both individuals must be willing to make a commitment to treatment as prescribed
                  by their randomization in this study.

               -  Speak and read English.

               -  Be stable for at least 6 weeks on any psychotropic medications either partner may
                  be taking. This criterion is established in order to minimize the likelihood that
                  significant outcome effects may be attributed to changes in psychotropic
                  medications rather than to the treatment protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Evidence or admission of severe intimate aggression as indicated by a &quot;yes&quot;
             endorsement to the one-question screen for severe violence items by either member of
             the couple occurring within the past 6-months.

               -  Partner with PTSD symptoms on the Life Events Checklist (LEC), Deployment Risk
                  and Resilience Inventory (DRRI) subscales (if active duty and is a Veteran of
                  deployment), and PTSD CheckList - Stressor Specific (PCL-S) warranting primary
                  treatment for him or herself.

               -  Recent initiation of other treatment (i.e., drug/alcohol treatment) or an
                  identified immediate need for other treatment (i.e., severe suicide risk, current
                  alcohol dependence).

               -  Current suicidal ideation severe enough to warrant immediate attention (as
                  determined by the Scale for Suicidal Ideation)

               -  Alcohol dependence as assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
                  Test (AUDIT).

               -  Any severe cognitive impairment that precludes retention of session content
                  across sessions or an ongoing psychotic or bipolar disorder.
