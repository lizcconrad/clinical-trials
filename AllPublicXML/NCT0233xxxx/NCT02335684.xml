  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial has been designed to study if it is possible to enhance work capacity
      during submaximal efforts in heart failure patients supported with continuous-flow left
      ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD).

      The hypothesis is that exercise tolerability during low to moderate workloads in CF-LVAD
      patients can be increased when pump speed is increased soon after the onset of exercise.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis described above the investigators will study submaximal exercise tests
      below anaerobic threshold in patients supported with CF-LVADs.Each patient will perform two
      tests- one with baseline CF-LVAD pump speed and the other with incrementally increased pump
      speed.
