  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the newly developed biosensor can be used
      to detect and quantify fungal cells in human blood samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study discussed here is part of a broader research project (IOF project) that is aimed at
      the development and implementation of a point-of-care devices, in which Fiber-Optic Surface
      Plasmon Resonance (FO-SPR) is used as a detection system. This project includes the
      development and implementation of the (FUNGDETECT) sensor for fast and accurate detection of
      fungal pathogens in human blood samples. In first instance, the sensor will be tested in
      buffer solutions spiked with a known amount of Candida albicans cells. Further validation of
      the prototype includes detection of these cells in human blood samples. In a first
      experiment, detection of yeast cells will be performed in blood samples from 5 healthy
      volunteers each spiked with yeast cells from different Candida spp.. A second experiment
      includes the detection in blood samples from 15 patients who suffer from a candidemia. The
      blood samples will be collected from patients of University Hospitals (UZ) Leuven.

    <description>Patients in the hospital and suspected to have a Candida infection will be tested for Candida infections via blood cultures. Blood samples for patients with a positive test will be taken immediately after the positive result and used to validate the FUNGDETECT sensor.</description>
