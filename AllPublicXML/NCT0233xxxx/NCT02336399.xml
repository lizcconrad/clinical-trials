  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).HBsAg loss/seroconversion is considered to be
      the ideal endpoint of antiviral therapy in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients,
      as well as the ultimate treatment goal in CHB. However, some patients who have achieved HBsAg
      loss would reverse back to HBsAg positive, or even become HBV reactive with recurrence of
      viremia. In current study, the viral and HBsAg response in patients who have achieved HBsAg
      loss by interferon (IFN) treatment will be observed for 96 weeks after the completion of IFN
      treatment. The primary analysis will be performed at the end of 96 weeks. Following the
      completion of the study period of 96 weeks, patients will be offered to participate in a long
      term study for further observation of additional 144 weeks (total of 240 weeks from the
      enrollment).

      Chronic hepatitis B patients who have achieved HBsAg loss from interferon treatment will be
      enrolled and observed for 96 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe will
      be measured every 3 months during the observation period. Their liver function and chemistry
      tests are also performed every 3 months. The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken
      every 3-6 months. The primary measurement is the percentage of patients who have positive
      HBsAg and/or a detectable level of HBV DNA. Following the completion of the study period,
      patients will be offered to participate in a long term study for further observation of
      additional 144 weeks.

        The study population in this study is composed of patients who have chronic hepatitis B and
        achieved HBsAg loss from interferon treatment. Eligible patients will have serum HBsAg and
        HBV DNA tests every 3 months for 96 weeks after finishing the interferon treatment. The
        sustained HBsAg response is defined as the levels of serum HBsAg mantaining below the low
        level of quantitation and the levels of HBV DNA remain undetectable. Following the
        completion of the study period, patients will be offered to participate in a long term
        study for further observation up to 240 weeks.
