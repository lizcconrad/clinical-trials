  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this project is to provide diabetes education to the diverse
      patient population at the Lions Eye Clinic, a resident-run ophthalmology practice at
      California Pacific Medical Center. Because of high clinic volume in a teaching environment,
      our patients often experience long wait times. The goal of this program is to utilize this
      wait time for diabetes education, a much-needed corollary to the eye care that patients
      receive at our clinic.

      This pilot project will investigate the impact of a program like this in our patient
      population. Specifically, the investigators are investigating whether diabetes education
      delivered in an ophthalmology setting enhances patient understanding of diabetes (via
      knowledge surveys) and/or leads to improved blood glucose control (via hemoglobin A1c). This
      is a 6-month study that runs through April 2015, and looks at the impact of an interactive
      diabetes education iPad app +/- in-person sessions with a diabetes educator. A subset of
      patients who meet with a diabetes educator will also be shown their own retinal images
      (compared to a normal retina).

        The proposed subjects are diabetic patients already approved to be seen in the Lions Eye
        Clinic, specifically for dilated eye exam by a retinal specialist. This is a high-risk
        population with advanced disease and often with limited preexisting knowledge about
        diabetes, thus providing the motivation for these educational interventions.

             hemoglobin A1c OR patient report, as specific blood sugar data and knowledge of
             particular medications are often limited in this population)
