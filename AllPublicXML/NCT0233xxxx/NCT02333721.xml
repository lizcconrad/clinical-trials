  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the short-term, long-term and oncological outcomes of
      laparoscopic spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection in a left-sided approach for
      advanced middle or upper third gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized comparison of laparoscopic spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node
      dissection for gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the short-term, long-term and
      oncological outcomes. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy,
      postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
