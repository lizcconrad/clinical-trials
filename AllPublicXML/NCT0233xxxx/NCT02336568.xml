  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin (OT) - a neurohormone and neuromodulator which is mainly synthesized in the
      hypothalamus - is a mediator stress regulation and improves social bonding. Recently, several
      theoretical studies suggested that PTSD patients have abnormal functioning of the OT system.
      According to these theories, dysfunction in the oxytocin system may modulate the
      interpersonal impairment that characterizes PTSD, and therefore intranasal OT may potentially
      relieve these symptoms. In two current studies that were conducted in Rambam health care we
      found that a single dose of intranasal OT reduces anxiety and irritability symptoms, and
      enhances emotional empathy and compassion, in patients with PTSD. The main goal of this study
      is to examine the effects of 21-days intranasal Oxytocin on clinical symptoms and social
      function in these patients.

      This study will examine the effect is of 21-days intranasal Oxytocin on clinical symptoms and
      social function in these patients, in a double blind (treatment/placebo) study design.
