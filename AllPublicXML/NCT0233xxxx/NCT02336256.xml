      Introduction: Any form of trauma, including surgery is known to result in oxidative stress.
      Single incision laparoscopy is a step forward towards almost scarless surgery. It is also
      expected to result in a lower degree of free radicals generation and faster normalization of
      the organism's antioxidant capacity.

      Aim: The aim of the study was to assess a number of plasma oxidative stress markers in
      patients operated due to inguinal hernia using typical totally extra peritoneal (TEP) and
      modified single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) methods.

      Material and methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients with no acute disease and severe
      chronic disorder, were qualified for inguinal hernia laparoscopic surgery. All were caucasian
      males, aged 24-69 and they underwent one of two surgical approaches: totally extra-peritoneal
      repair (TEP) and single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). TEP patients created Group 1
      (n= 17) and SILS patients formed Group 2 (n= 17). Total antioxidant status (TAS) and
      thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were determined in three time points: before,
      one day and four days after the laparoscopic surgery.

      Thirty-two consecutive patients with no acute disease and severe chronic disorder were
      qualified for inguinal hernia laparoscopic surgery. All were caucasian males, aged 24-69
      underwent one of two different surgical approaches: totally extra-peritoneal (TEP) repair and
      single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). TEP patients created Group 1 (n= 17) and SILS
      patients formed Group 2 (n= 17).

      Blood Sampling and Biochemical Analysis Ulnar venous blood samples were collected from the
      participants three times (fasting, between 6:00 and 7:00 AM): before (0), one day (1) and
      four days (2) after laparoscopic surgery. Baseline (0) blood samples were used for routine
      pre-operative laboratory assessment, including complete blood count, basic coagulation tests,
      C-reactive protein, glucose and electrolytes levels. Total antioxidant status (TAS) and
      thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were determined in three time points: 0, 1
      and 2 as described above.

      Spectrophotometry was used to measure TAS (RANDOX Laboratories, Crumlin, Antrim, UK) on
      Statfax 1904Plus (Awareness Technology, Palm City, FL) and TBARS according to the Okhawa
      method [11] (Sigma reagents, Germany) on Specord M40 (Carl-Zeiss, Germany). The intra- and
      inter-assay coefficients of variation were as follows: TAS (1.6 % and 3.7%), and TBARS (1.9%
      and 3.8%)
