  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal fistulas are the main etiology of perianal abscesses and suppurations. They are common
      and generally associated with pain, anal incontinence, impaired quality of life and work
      incapacity. The therapeutic management of this disease has a double objective: heal the
      suppuration and preserve the sphincter function. Each year, anal fistulas affect 1 in 10 000
      in the normal population, with a difference in prevalence between men and women (1.23 per 10
      000 men and 0.56 per 10 000 women). The average age of the patients was 40 years (Simpson et
      al., 2012).

      In about 80% of cases, anal fistulas are secondary to an infection of Hermann and Desfosses'
      anal glands (cryptogenic or cryptoglandular). Infection of the anal gland can result in an
      abscess between the internal and external sphincters, which in turn can spread to other parts
      of the perianal region. The infection can follow many directions from this point in the
      intersphincteric plan. When the pus reaches the skin, the fistula is formed. Anal fistula
      therefore has always an intraductal origin, cryptic, with a primary port at this level, and
      the disregard of which causes the recurrence of the fistula; and usually a secondary port in
      the skin.

      Fistulas are usually divided into two groups. The first group contains fistulas called
      &quot;simple&quot;, which are intersphincteric fistulas or trans-sphincteric involving only the lower
      third of the sphincter complex. Fistulas usually didn't affect any muscle. The second group
      contains fistulas called &quot;complex&quot;. These are intersphincteric, trans-sphincteric, or even
      suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric fistulas.

      For many years, the treatment of choice was to open the fistula (fistulotomy), but this
      procedure was associated with a risk of incontinence, the consequences could be potentially
      devastating. Other surgical treatments include setons, fibrin glue, collagen plugs and
      advancement flap technique to cover internal opening of the fistula. The success of these
      therapies remains variable.

      The advancement flap technique remains a strategy of choice in the treatment of anal fistulas
      and particularly in the case of complex fistulas. The success rate of the advancement flap
      technique remains variable across studies but a recent meta-analysis finds a success rate of
      around 60%.

      A new technique for closing anal fistula is currently in development with the use of a
      closure clip nitinol (OTSC® Proctology Laboratory: OVESCO and French Distributor: Life
      Partners). This new technique has been validated in a porcine model of anal fistula, ensuring
      the safety of the device. A first case was published in a patient with complex anal fistula
      (high trans-sphincteric). After erosion fistula tract with a special brush, a nitinol clip
      (OTSC® Proctology) was deposited on the internal opening of the fistula. Eight months after
      surgery, the fistula was healed and the clip was removed by cutting with special pliers. This
      technique is currently being broadcast and dozens of patients were treated with this clip
      without any further scientific validation of the process.

      To date, this innovative technique of the closure clip has not yet been assessed in a
      randomized controlled trial. It is therefore essential to carry out a prospective evaluation
      in order to determine the effectiveness and safety of this new device in the case of complex
      anal fistulas.

      After validation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients included in this
      clinical trial will be randomized between the two arms of the study for the closure of the
      anal fistula:

        -  Control group: advancement flap technique Experimental group: closure clip (OTSC®
           Proctology Laboratory: OVESCO and French Distributor: Life Partners)

      Follow up of the patients will be performed until 1 year after the intervention.
