        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is &gt;18 years of age.

          2. Patient is considered a candidate for arterial or venous embolization in the
             peripheral vasculature.

          3. Patient has a target vessel diameter of 3-8mm and a target PED landing zone of greater
             than 25mm wherein the vessel diameter is between 3 and 8 mm.

          4. The patient or legal guardian has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees
             to its provisions and has provided informed written consent.

          5. The patient has suitable vessel anatomy that would allow proper placement of the PED.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has one of the following conditions:

             1.1 Arterio-venous fistula 1.2 Hypercoagulability 1.3 Systemic coagulopathy 1.4
             Connective tissue disorder such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome 1.5 Congenital arteritis
             such as Takayasu's Disease 1.6 Other circulatory disorders at the discretion of the
             implanting physician

          2. The patient has an uncontrolled infectious disease.

          3. The patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months.

          4. The patient is pregnant.

          5. The patient has a condition that inhibits radiographic visualization of the PED.

          6. The patient has a known allergy or intolerance to Nitinol.

          7. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to contrast that cannot be pre-treated.

          8. The patient's access vessels preclude safe insertion of the delivery system.

          9. The patient is currently participating in another device or drug study.
