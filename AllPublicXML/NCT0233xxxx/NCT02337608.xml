    <textblock>
      -  Approximately 60 patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis will be
           evaluated for improvement of disease activity (efficacy) when taking GLPG1205 or
           matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks in addition to their stable background
           treatment.

        -  During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for any side effects that
           may occur (safety and tolerability), and the amount of GLPG1205 present in the blood
           (Pharmacokinetics) as well as the effects of GLPG1205 on disease- and mechanism of
           action-related parameters (Pharmacodynamics) in blood, stool and colonic biopsies will
           be determined.
