      Online trials require informed consent from participants. Massive online trials make
      face-to-face signed consent unrealistic and existing consent comprehension could be improved
      to increase participant safety and understanding.

      This trial will compare understanding of traditional digital consent with multi-media consent
      and with consent that is multi-media and interactive and uses a test and train model.

      The computer will assign participants to 1 of 3 methods to present online consent to
      participants

      Online trials require informed consent from participants. Massive online trials make
      face-to-face signed consent unrealistic and existing consent comprehension could be improved
      to increase participant safety.

      Without accurate knowledge decision-making is not informed. Informed consent for
      participation in research is part of this process. In online trials the opportunity for
      face-to-face signed consent with researchers is not an option.

      Consent acts as a safeguard that full disclosure occurred. Adequate documentation is evidence
      against false reports of coercion.

      Informed consent inclusive of signed participant information sheets provide a record between
      researcher and participant of the roles and agreements they share.

      According to existing research, only 6% of consents and participant information sheets are
      written below an eighth grade level of comprehension; 54% of participants with an 8th grade
      level education partially understood the consent with figures rising to 72% for participants
      with greater than 8th grade educations, however no participant fully understood the consent
      materials. The deficits ranged from misunderstandings about risk, side effects, adverse
      effects reporting, a participants right to withdraw, confidentiality and even the purpose of
      the trial.

      This trial will compare understanding of traditional digital consent with multi-media consent
      and with consent that is multi-media and interactive and uses a test and train model.

      The computer will assign participants to 1 of 3 methods to present online consent to
      participants
