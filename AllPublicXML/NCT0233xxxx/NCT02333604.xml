      The Cancer Experience RegistryÂ®: An Online Initiative to Understand the Experiences of Those
      Impacted By a Cancer Diagnosis.The Registry is a web-based platform to distribute
      cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys. Study surveys are designed based on input from
      advisor experts, including patients and caregivers, and focus on the social, emotional,
      physical, financial and decision-making experiences of those who have been diagnosed with
      cancer and their caregivers. Findings contribute toward enhancing care for patients,
      survivors and caregivers via programming and policy initiatives.

      The aims of the Registry are to: 1) better understand the psychosocial experiences and needs
      of people who have been impacted by cancer, including patients, survivors and caregivers; 2)
      inform the research community, healthcare providers, patient advocates and policy makers
      around gaps in care and the psychosocial challenges of people affected by cancer; 3) use the
      findings to develop and disseminate tailored (data-guided) programs and services that will
      address the emotional and social needs and ultimately improve the long-term quality of life
      of people affected by cancer; 4) link registrants to cancer related resources and programs
      via an online, modifiable platform; and 5) provide collaborating sites (e.g.,
      hospitals/health networks/CSC affiliates) with aggregated reports on quality and needs of
      members or customers to enhance or improve quality of care.

      Findings from the Registry are disseminated online at
      www.CancerSupportCommunity.org/RegistryIndexReport2017
