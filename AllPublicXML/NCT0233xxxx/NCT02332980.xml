      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab alone or with idelalisib or ibrutinib
      works in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other low-grade B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas that have returned after a period of improvement or have not responded
      to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, block cancer growth in different
      ways by targeting certain cells and allow the immune system to attack the cancer. Idelalisib
      and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab alone or with idelalisib or ibrutinib may be an effective
      treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the efficacy (overall response rate) of single-agent MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in
      relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (Arm A) other
      low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the safety of single-agent MK-3475 in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A), other low grade B-NHL
      (Arm B), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).

      II. Test the progression free survival, treatment free survival, duration of response and
      time to next therapy of single-agent MK-3475 in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A), other low grade
      B-NHL (Arm B), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).

      III. Test the complete response rate of single MK-3475 in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A), other low
      grade B-NHL (Arm B), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).

      IV. Test the safety of MK-3475 in combination with the signal inhibitor (either idelalisib or
      ibrutinib) in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A) and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).

      V. Test the progression-free survival, treatment-free survival, duration of response and time
      to next therapy of MK-3475 in combination with the signal inhibitor (either idelalisib or
      ibrutinib) in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A) and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).

      VI. Test the overall and complete response rates of MK-3475 in combination with the signal
      inhibitor (either idelalisib or ibrutinib) in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A) and CLL with Richter's
      transformation (Arm C).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the potential association between programmed cell death ligand 1
      (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L2 expression on tumor and T cells and/or PD-L1
      soluble levels in plasma with clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade.

      II. To investigate the effects of MK-3475 on selected markers of immune modulation and immune
      profiles in peripheral blood and tumor samples.

      III. Examine T-cell immune synapse function and expression/location of co-stimulatory and
      co-inhibitory molecules (including effector molecules) as potential biomarkers to response
      for anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      ALL PATIENTS (ARMS A, B, and C): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving benefit may continue to
      receive treatment for an additional 12 months at the discretion of the investigator. Patients
      with CLL or CLL with Richter's transformation experiencing stable disease without partial
      remission or progressive disease at 3 months of treatment with pembrolizumab proceed to the
      treatment continuation phase.

      CONTINUATION PHASE (ARMS A and C): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Patients also receive idelalisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 OR ibrutinib
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 or 24 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving benefit may
      continue to receive treatment for an additional 12 months at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

                       moderate size lymphocytes

                    -  Immunophenotyping consistent with CLL defined as:

                         -  The predominant population of lymphocytes share both B-cell antigens
                            (cluster of differentiation [CD]19, CD20 [typically dim expression] or
                            CD23) as well as CD5 in the absence of other pan-T-cell markers (CD3,
                            CD2, etc.)

                         -  Clonality as evidenced by kappa or lambda light chain expression

                            for the diagnosis of CLL

                    -  Before diagnosing CLL or SLL, mantle cell lymphoma must be excluded by
                       demonstrating a negative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis

          -  Patients must be previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy;
             EXCEPTION: CLL patients with Richter's transformation or Hodgkin transformation do not
             need prior therapy to enroll

               -  NOTE:

                    -  Prior chemotherapy or biologic novel therapy or anti-cancer monoclonal
                       antibody based therapy for treatment of CLL will be considered prior
                       therapy; nutraceutical treatments with no established benefit in CLL (such
                       as epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG, found in green tea or other herbal

                       be considered &quot;prior treatment&quot;

                       treatment of autoimmune complications of CLL does constitute prior therapy
                       for CLL

               -  Note: marked hypogammaglobulinemia or the development of a monoclonal protein in
                  the absence of any of the above criteria for active disease are not sufficient
                  for protocol therapy OR biopsy proven Richter's transformation or Hodgkin
                  transformation of the CLL; NOTE: both untreated and previously treated patients
                  in this category can be enrolled; they do not need to meet the progressive
                  disease criteria in first bullet as long as measurable disease can be detected by
                  positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or CT (&gt;= 1.5 cm in

             days prior to idelalisib or ibrutinib initiation that in the opinion of
