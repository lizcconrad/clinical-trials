  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a highly prevalent condition, reaching approximately 7% to 30% of older adults
      aged from 65 up to 80 years [2]. Although exercises seemed to be beneficial for the frail
      elders, there is still insufficient evidence to indicate the appropriate modality, frequency
      and intensity of physical exercises that were able to improve physical functioning in this
      population [9]. The virtual reality (VR) using interactive games (exergames) have generated
      broad scientific and clinical interest in recent years[10]. Studies indicate that older
      adults can benefit from training with exergames in improving mobility [12, 13], lower limb
      strength [14], cognition, particularly executive function [13], body balance [10, 15-18],
      reaction time [12] and may contribute indirectly to prevent falls [10, 19, 20]. But, there is
      still insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of exergames are superior even to other
      types of intervention [21-23] or in combination with conventional physiotherapy [24] The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of adding exercises using
      interactive videogames (exergames) in improving physical functioning on frail and pre frail
      older people when compared to conventional physiotherapy. A parallel randomized clinical with
      a 6 month follow-up period will be conducted with 82 frail community dwelling older adults.
      Participants randomized to the Experimental Group will be submitted to 30 minutes of
      conventional physiotherapy and 20 minutes of therapy using interactive games Xbox 360 Video
      Game and Entertainment Microsoft System with Kinect sensor.

      The Control Group will receive 50 minutes of conventional physiotherapy. Both groups will
      receive 50 minutes of intervention twice a week for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes will be
      assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery, the Usual walking speed test and Four
      Step Square Test in the baseline, 3 and 6 months after that.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is considered a biological geriatric syndrome, characterized by a decreased
      resistance to stresses and functional reserve due to the cumulative decline in multiple
      physiological systems, with consequent increased state of vulnerability [2]. Negative health
      related outcomes, such as disability, recurrent hospitalization, institutionalization, falls
      and mortality [2-4] are associated with frailty, considered an emerging public health problem
      [2, 5]. Physical exercise has been recommended as an intervention strategy for the prevention
      and rehabilitation of the mobility-related outcome in the frail elderly whit positive impact
      on functional capacity and performance [8].

      A functional downward spiral characterized by an impairment of several functional domains,
      such as strength, muscular endurance and motor-cognitive processes, ultimately leading to
      restricted mobility and decreased physical activity level is commonly observed in frail older
      people. Interventions that promote the integration of multisensory, cognitive and motor
      skills can be able to motivate the older people to remain more active for longer periods,
      despite their limitations. Exergames involve tasks in virtual environments that combine
      physical and cognitive demands in an attractive and challenging way. The player is encouraged
      to achieve goals and overcome limits during the game, providing immediate feedback in
      relation to their performance. The game experience can create a greater sense of
      self-efficacy and generate a more positive perception of personal skills, modulated by a
      positive environment reinforcement, consequently increasing motivation and engagement. This
      combination of greater sense of self-efficacy and greater motivation could provide a positive
      and necessary influence for most older people to overcome their limitations and create new
      lifestyle habits [25], decreasing disability. This study sought to investigate the
      effectiveness of adding exercises using interactive videogames (exergames) in improving
      physical functioning on frail and pre frail older people when compared to conventional
      physiotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Community dwelling older adults without severe cognitive impairment (defined as a Mini
        Mental State Examination (MMSE) score adjusted according to the educational level with
        reference cutoff scores of: 13 points for those who are illiterate, ; 18 points for those
        with elementary and middle levels, and 26 points for those who have a high level 26),
        without any physiotherapy intervention for at least three months and classified as frail or
        pre-frail, according to the phenotype of frailty using Fried et al. criteria:

          1. Unintentional weight loss of ≥ 5% or ≥ 4.5kg body weight in the previous year.

          2. Exhaustion assessed by self-reported fatigue, indicated by two questions of the Center
             for Epidemiological Studies - Depression: (a) I felt that everything I did was an
             effort; (b) I could not get going. . Subjects answering &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; to either of these
             questions are categorized as frail by the exhaustion criterion.

          3. Decreased grip strength (kg/force) in the dominant hand adjusted according to sex and
             body mass index (BMI). The cutoff for grip strength (Kg) criterion for men 2will be:
             BMI ≤ 24 grip strength ≤ 29; BMI 24,1 - 28 grip strength ≤ 30; BMI &gt; 28 grip strength
             ≤ 32. The cutoff for grip strength (Kg) criterion for women will be 2: BMI ≤ 23 - grip
             strength ≤ 17; BMI 23,1 - 26 grip strength ≤ 17,3; BMI 26,1 - 29 grip strength ≤ 18;
