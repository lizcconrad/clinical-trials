  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bev improves the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in unresectable mCRC. In the phase III
      TRIBE trial upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bev provided a significant advantage in terms of PFS and
      RR compared to FOLFIRI plus bev. A trend toward better OS was also evidenced. The second-line
      treatment was at investigator's choice. A manageable increase in diarrhea, mucositis and
      neutropenia was reported, while no differences in febrile neutropenia, serious adverse events
      and toxic deaths were evidenced.

      A growing amount of data support the clinical relevance of achieving an early and deep tumor
      shrinkage.

      Phase III TML and BEBYP trials demonstrated that the continuation of bev beyond disease
      progression combined with a switched chemotherapy regimen provided a significant advantage in
      terms of OS and PFS.

      Based on recent evidences, the partial interruption of the upfront &quot;induction&quot; chemotherapy
      before disease progression and the prosecution of bev until disease progression as
      maintenance treatment is a valid strategy in the treatment of mCRC.

      On the basis of these considerations, a first-line doublet plus bev followed by a second-line
      switched doublet (from oxaliplatin to irinotecan and viceversa) plus bev should be considered
      a standard option for mCRC patients. Only retrospectively collected data are currently
      available about the efficacy of first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev followed by second-line
      rechallenge with FOLFOXIRI plus bev. We therefore designed the present phase III randomized
      trial of first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev followed by reintroduction of FOLFOXIRI plus bev at
      progression versus FOLFOX plus bev followed by FOLFIRI plus bev at progression in first- and
      second-line treatment of unresectable mCRC patients.

    <time_frame>from randomization to the first of the following events: a) death; b) disease progression on any treatment given after 1st progression, up to 18 months after last patient last visit</time_frame>
    <description>PFS2 will be defined as beginning with randomization and ending with the first of the following events: a) death; b) disease progression on any treatment given after 1st progression. For patients that will not receive any treatment within 3 months after 1st progression, PFS2 will be equal to PFS. The determination of disease progression will be based on investigator-reported measurements. Disease status will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Censoring rules for PFS2 will be: end of study without PD, loss at follow-up. Curative surgery for metastasis will not result in censoring for PFS2.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and progression free at the time of the analysis.

    <description>Time to failure of strategy (TFS) is defined as the time time from randomization to the first of the following events: death; patient requires the addition of a new therapeutic agent (i.e. an agent not included in the original strategy); patient experiences disease progression while being treated with all agents that are components of the initial treatment strategy (except for agents which cannot be used because of persistent toxicity or contraindications); or patient experiences disease progression during a partial or complete treatment holiday from initial treatment strategy and receives no further therapy within 3 months. Subjects who did not have an event as stated above while on study will be censored at the last evaluable radiographic assessment date.</description>
