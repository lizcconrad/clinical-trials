  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to improve adherence rate through pharmaceutical care in patients with
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to help achieving therapeutic goals and finally to improve
      the quality of life of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to treatment is a primary determinant for the effectiveness of health care.
      Non-compliance may lead to therapeutic failure, make more difficult and complex the
      management of chronic diseases or cause death. The effectiveness of interventions on
      adherence has an important impact in the health of the population. Systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with high proportion of hospital admissions and
      deaths and high cost of treatment. The prevalence of adherence in this group of patients in
      Brazil is very low (31.7%) and the drug treatment is complex. Our aim is to assess the
      effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Care in the adherence of drug treatment by SLE patients
      attended in a Rheumatology outpatient clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

      Randomized clinical trial (pragmatic trial), in which 120 adult patients with confirmed SLE
      diagnosis will be followed for 12 months, and randomized in two groups: the intervention
      group (attended by a pharmacist according to the Dader Method for Pharmaceutical Care), and
      the control group (attended by a non-pharmacist professional with counseling on
      hygiene/nutrition and reduction of risks in lupus therapy). The main outcome will be
      adherence to drug therapy and secondary outcomes the improvement of the medical condition and
      the quality of life of the patients.

    <description>The patients assigned for the intervention group will receive guidance from a pharmacist (&quot;pharmaceutical consultation&quot;) in addition to the medical care habitually delivered by the hospital.
The pharmacist will review the drug therapy, identifying current and potential problems related to the drug prescription, making a systematic assessment of the need, effectiveness and safety of all medications and their adequacy to the patient's life routine. A care plan will then be designed along with the patient that may include interventions and/or referral to other practitioners.</description>

    <description>The patients assigned to the control group will receive the medical care habitually provided by the hospital and will be attended by a non-pharmacist professional, who will provide hygiene/nutritional counseling and risk reduction, such as smoking cessation advice; use of estrogen-based contraceptive drugs; exposure to sunlight, proper use of sunscreen and clothes; nutritional guidance on the intake of low saturated-fat food. As usual, information about the use of medication will be provided by the attending physician.</description>
