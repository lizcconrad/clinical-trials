    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well vincristine sulfate liposome works in treating
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement or has
      not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate
      liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Liposomal
      encapsulation prolongs bioavailability (proportion of drug that enters the circulation when
      introduced into the body) of vincristine sulfate, and may increase its delivery to cancer
      cells with fewer side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of administering vincristine sulfate liposome injection
      (VSLI) to relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients having failed, refused
      or not a candidate for at least one chemotherapy salvage regimen.

      II. To observe the hematologic improvement-rate of VSLI in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with VSLI. II. To observe the response
      rate (complete remission [CR], complete remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi],
      partial response [PR], and morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]) of VSLI in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposome via injection on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 6 months.

    <description>Confidence intervals will be calculated around the estimates of the response rate (CR, CRi, PR, and MLFS) of VSLI. Assuming a response rate of 0.1, with 39 participants, 95 percent confidence intervals with a 0.09 margin of error (0.01, 0.19) or a margin of error of 0.16 around a response rate of 0.5 will be created.</description>
