  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project concerns a type of very debilitating diabetic foot complications called Charcots
      osteoarthropathy (COA). This disease is characterized by a rapidly progressing destruction of
      the load bearing joints, primarily in the feet, resulting in loss of structure and
      remodeling. Untreated this cascade leads to the collapse of the bones, meaning severe pain
      and walking disability for the patient. Reconstruction is often very difficult or impossible,
      and furthermore the collapse can lead to chronic foot ulcers and infections, which in the
      worst case can be fatal.

      Treatment options are currently limited to early diagnosis and physical offloading
      (immobilisation), assisted wound healing and surgical intervention.

      The purpose of this project is to investigate and describe the bone-related factors, which
      separate COA from other, less acute, diabetic foot changes. The investigators wish to
      describe the long term consequences of COA - both anatomically, physiologically and
      biochemically.

      The investigators will be doing this in a follow-up investigations on a group of COA patients
      tested 8 years ago. Little is known of the long term changes to the bone structure after
      acute COA, and the investigators want to visualize to what extend the bone damage is
      permanent.

      To do this the investigators will be using DXA-scans, x-ray, blood tests including bone
      markers, neurophysiological tests and occlusion plethysmography.
