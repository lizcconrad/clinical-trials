      128 patients between 18 and 76 years who attended the Operative Dentistry Clinic at Dental
      School, Universidad de Chile, were included in the study. 58 patients were bleaching
      (experimental group) and 70 patients don't accepted the bleaching procedure (control group)
      were included in this study and signed a consent form.Experimental group Patients who agreed
      to be bleaching were treated with 10% carbamide peroxide (CP) gel (Whiteness Perfect, FGM) to
      each subject With verbal instructions for 3 weeks with daily applications of 1 hour according
      to manufacturers indications , before and after this procedure was applied again the NEO-FFI
      personality test form, had 30 minutes to answer it.Control group:Patients who refused to be
      bleached were administered the personality test NEO-FFI, had 30 minutes to answer it.

      Data collection NEO-FFI data was collected in a Microsoft Excel data sheet and analyzed by a
      psychology that was blind to patient's expectations. According to the answers, each scale
      might get a score between 0 and 50.

      Statistical analysis For comparisons between scales between groups of patients were bleaching
      and who refused to be bleached Mann Whitney test was used.For each pair of scales it was
      determined if any one of them predominated over its counterpart by Wilcoxon rank test before
      and after bleaching . To corroborate the statistical power of this study was calculated
      post-hoc with the NEO-FFI scores values between the comparisons and showed a high statistical
      power (0.99) by G-Power software.
