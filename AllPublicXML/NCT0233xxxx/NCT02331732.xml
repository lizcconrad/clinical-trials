      This trial aims to increase the wellbeing of tuberculosis patients and their adherence to
      medication in Chisinau, The Republic of Moldova. The design is an individually randomised
      controlled trial (RCT) and will involve 400 TB patients during their 'continuation phase' of
      treatment. The trial will have two arms; 200 patients will form the control group and receive
      the standard provision of Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) and 200 will receive Virtually
      Observed Treatment (VOT).

      VOT differs from DOT in that the daily observation of patients taking their medication will
      be observed via internet video messages rather than in-person. Based on a small sample of
      patient interviews we think that for some patients DOT may be a hindrance rather than a help.
      VOT allows patients to take their treatment in the comfort of their home and means they don't
      have to travel to their polyclinic every day.

      There will be a central VOT observation centre where VOT observers will view and respond to
      video messages sent in by patients in the VOT arm. The messages will be sent via an M-Health
      app. The VOT observers will also respond to the patients by sending feedback to the patients.
      The trial duration will depend on the recruitment rate of eligible patients but is expected
      to take 16 months.
