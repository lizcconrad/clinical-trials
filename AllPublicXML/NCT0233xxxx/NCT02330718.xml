      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the factors which are associated with the diagnosis
      and predict prognosis and therapeutic targets by collecting specimens of tissue sample,
      peripheral blood, and bone marrow aspirates at the time of diagnosis or relapse/refractory in
      patients with malignant hematologic disorders except acute leukemia. This study is eligible
      for patients who are diagnosed with malignant hematologic disorders except acute leukemia or
      who will have diagnostic procedure with suspicion of having hematologic malignancy.
      Prospective cohort is for patients who are not in treatment for hematologic malignancy.
      Retrospective cohort is for patients who are diagnosed and in treatment.
