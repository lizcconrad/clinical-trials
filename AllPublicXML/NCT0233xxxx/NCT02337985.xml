    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies gene therapy following combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
      Placing genes that have been shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth and spread of the
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into the patient's peripheral blood stem cells may improve the
      body's ability to fight HIV. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving gene therapy after combination chemotherapy may improve
      the body's ability to fight HIV and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-treated hematopoietic
      stem progenitor cells (HSPC) (lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic
      progenitor cells) transplantation in AIDS patients completing treatment for non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of HIV infection on the presence of gene-marked blood cells as
      measured by woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed before, during, and after ATI.

      II. To demonstrate the engraftment of gene-modified progeny cells following such treatment.

      III. To determine if selection of these gene-modified progeny cells occurs during analytical
      treatment interruption (ATI) of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5; rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on day 1; etoposide, doxorubicin hydrochloride and vincristine sulfate IV
      over 96 hours on days 1-4; and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 5. Patients then
      receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) beginning on day 6 and continuing
      until absolute neutrophil count recovers. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients then receive lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells IV on day 0 (48 hours after the final combination chemotherapy course).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and
      24 months, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 10 years.
