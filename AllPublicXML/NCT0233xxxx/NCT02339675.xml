  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current study will investigate de quality (psychometric properties) and clinical utility of
      several measures of upper limb function, according to disability level. Therefore, several
      aspects will be inquired:

        -  Was there an effect of rehabilitation

        -  Is the measure able to detect change over time? And thus the change exceed measurement
           error and is it clinically important (responsiveness)

        -  Does the measure assess what it claims to measure (validity)

        -  Is the measure able to differentiate all performances of the patients, inclusively the
           very good and very bad performances (floor and ceiling effects)

        -  Does the measure gives similar results under consistent test conditions on another
           testing day (reliability) Worldwide, theoretical approaches to physical therapy and
           rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis often appear significantly different. Since the
           present research protocol will be performed at different centers across European
           countries (and US sites), this multi-center study can additionally be applied for
           mapping the volume and content of rehabilitation, as well as the differential impact of
           diverse rehabilitation approaches and training volume on mobility, for several
           disability levels.

      Some health-economic analyses will be performed to examine what the approximate cost of
      rehabilitation compared to effects is and what drivers of costs are (setting, equipment,
      staff).
