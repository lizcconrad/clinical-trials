    <textblock>
      Since 2002, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has resulted in a dramatic change
      in the prognosis of patients with aortic valve stenosis illegible to surgery. However, this
      intervention may induce heavy conduction disorder due to the proximity of the aortic annulus
      and the conduction pathways. So far, there is no clear recommandation for clinical management
      of conduction disorder after TAVI. Standard criterion cannot be applied due to the multiple
      comorbidity factors observed in these patients. As described in conventional aortic valve
      surgery, a degree of inflammation and ischemia of the conduction pathways may be involved in
      the first days. This is the reason underlying the systematic implantation of epicardial
      electrodes. Such temporary back-up pacing is not possible in TAVI patients.

      The primary end-point of this study is to confirm that standard criterion for pacing are
      reliable in post-TAVI conduction disorders and to analyze the contribution of a systematic
      electrophysiological study (EPS).

      In TAVI patients, indications for pacing were persistent high-degree atrioventricular block
      (AVB) or bundle branch block appearance associated to HV interval longer than 70ms, 24 hours
      after the procedure.

      After a two-month follow-up, clinical and ECG evaluation and 24-hour holter monitoring will
      be realized in patients without pacemaker and compared to data obtained from the devices in
      pacemaker-implanted patients (% of ventricular pacing &gt; 1% ; presence of more than 1 AVB
      episod).

      Inclusions will take place from August 2014 to February 2015. We plan to include 165
      consecutive patients with TAVI through a femoral approach.

      At the inclusion, clinical baseline and electrocardiographic data will be collected. During
      the procedure, baseline ECG data as well as conduction disorders will be recorded. An EP
      study will be performed (measure of AH and HV intervals) before and after TAVI. Aortic
      surface area, transvalvular mean gradient, presence of periprothetic leak and LV ejection
      fraction will be determined by echocardiography within the first 24 hours.

      After the procedure, a 24-hour ECG monitoring will be done in ICU. A pacemaker will be
      implanted in case of persistent severe conduction disorders at 24 hours post-TAVI . All
      patients will be implanted with SORIN Group KORA DR devices to benefit from the AAI-SafeR
      mode and the AVB episodes automated analysis. All implanted pacemakers will be settled with
      identical parameters to allow appropriate patient data analysis (AAI-SafeR for sinus rhythm
      patients and VVIR in chronic atrial fibrillation patients).

      In patients with 24-hour persistence of bundle branch block onset after TAVI, a repeated EPS
      with HV recording will be performed. If HV interval is &gt; 70ms, a pacemaker will be implanted
      and the patient will be added to the pacemaker-implanted patients. In the absence of
      persistent conduction disorder 24h after the procedure, no specific supervision will be done.

      All patients will have a 2-month follow up. At this time, clinical, ECG and echocardiographic
      data will be collected. Additional 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring will be performed in
      non-implanted patients and additional device control will be performed in implanted patients.
      Pacemaker implantation will be confirmed if there is more than 1% of ventricular pacing or at
      least one DDD mode switch.

      In non-implanted patients, the non-indication for pacing was confirmed in the absence of
      clinical event and 24-hour Holter ECG recording abnormality.

      The secondary endpoint of the study is to define a posteriori risk factors for pacemaker
      implantation after TAVI included in the liste hereafter:

        -  Clinical data: age, drug-induced bradycardia, hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
           creatinin clearance, troponin value.

        -  Electrocardiographic data: QRS duration, PR interval, preexisting bundle branch block or
           AV block, QRS axis, sinus rhythm

        -  Echocardiographic data : aortic surface area, LV ejection fraction, aortic
           annulus/prothesis ratio, aortic annulus/balloon diameter ratio

        -  Electrophysiological data : HV interval before and after TAVI
