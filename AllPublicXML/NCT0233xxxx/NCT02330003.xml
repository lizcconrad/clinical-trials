      The purpose of this study to evaluate the safety of IL-YANG Inactivated Split Influenza
      Vaccine (IL-YANG FLU Vaccine Prefilled Syringe INJ.) in comparison with Fluarix Prefilled
      Syringe (inactivated split influenza vaccine) after single-dose intramuscular administration.

    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical study. After providing
      voluntary written informed consent, subjects underwent protocol-specific assessments and
      tests within the 4 weeks prior to administration of the study vaccine, and those who met all
      of the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized sequentially to the test group or the
      comparator group according to the pre-generated randomization code. To investigate the safety
      of the study drug with a two-dose regimen in children, the test group received another dose
      28 days after the first dose.

      The investigator evaluated the safety and immunogenicity for each subject throughout the
      study. Safety assessments were performed 28 days after the first dose (Visit 4, End-of-Study
      Visit) for the comparator group receiving a single-dose regimen of Fluarix Prefilled Syringe,
      and for the test group receiving a two-dose regimen of the test drug, 28 days after the first
      dose (Visit 4) and 28 days after the second dose (Visit 6, End-of-Study Visit). Subjects were
      instructed to record any adverse event occurring after vaccination in the Patient Diary Card.
      For the immunogenicity assessment, an antibody titer test was performed prior to dosing at
      Visit 2 (baseline) and 28 days (Visit 4) after the first vaccination for both the test group
      and comparator group.
