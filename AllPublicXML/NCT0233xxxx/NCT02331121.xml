  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for children and infants under 14 years
      of age. Many of these deaths are preventable, in part by promoting injury prevention
      behaviors but also by administering effective emergency first aid techniques until advanced
      care arrives. This project created a web site program that paired video-based instruction
      with interactive skills training to teach parents of children birth to 12 years old basic
      first-aid and CPR skills, and that included the option to practice skills as needed.

      Program content was based on the American Heart Association's (AHA) 2010 guidelines for CPR
      and first aid training. The Online IMM course was designed to teach participants in six
      modules: Principles of care; CPR for infants; CPR for children; How to relieve infant
      choking; How to relieve child choking; and Preventing injuries. Participants were also able
      to view text articles on first aid topics, such as Wound care or Caring for burns. Although
      the users of the Online IMM training program did not have direct contact with a manikin
      during their training, there were opportunities to practice CPR skills through the use of
      interactive animations. These animations demonstrated and then encouraged users to practice
      key functions similar to actual CPR skill delivery: including the location, depth and rate of
      compressions, opening the airway and giving breaths. Participants were encouraged to view the
      entire program; however, they could navigate and review all program content as much or as
      little as desired.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents or guardians of children aged newborn to 12 years old could potentially be as
             young as 18 years old. Parents or legal guardians could potentially be as old as 65 or
             older.

          -  Children under the age of 18 were not included, even with parental consent, because of
             the online nature of the study and inability to verify parental consoent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Only English-speaking participants were accepted because the program was developed
             only for English speakers.

          -  All English-speaking parents of children aged newborn - 12 years old who wished to
             participate were included.

          -  There were no exclusions based on race/ethnicity.
