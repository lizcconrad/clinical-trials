  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective descriptive monocentric study whose purpose is to describe the clonal
      evolution of the mutational pattern in cfDNA of a cohort of patients with Diffuse Large
      B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (DLBCL) before, during and after standard treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determinate and to describe the clonal evolution, 30 DLBCL cases with available matched
      tumor DNA and plasma will be collected and analyzed by routinely applicable next generation
      sequencing (NGS) at the time of diagnosis, at mid treatment, at the end of treatment and at
      12 months after diagnosis.
