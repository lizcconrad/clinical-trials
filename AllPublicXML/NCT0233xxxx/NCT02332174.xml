  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of
      single and multiple doses of rufinamide. The effects of food and sex on the PK properties of
      rufinamide in these Chinese volunteers were also evaluated.

      This single- and multiple-dose, randomized, open-label study was conducted in healthy Chinese
      subjects. In the single-dose study, volunteers were randomly assigned to 4 dose groups and
      received a single dose of 200, 400, 800, 1200 mg rufinamide tablets under fasted condition.
      An additional food effect study was performed in the 200-mg dose group by assessing changes
      in PK parameters after high-fat diet. In the multiple-dose study, 10 subjects were
      administered 200-mg rufinamide formulation twice daily for 6 consecutive days. LC-MS/MS
      method was applied to determine plasma concentration of rufinamide. Tolerability was assessed
      based on investigator inquiries, spontaneous reports, and clinical evaluations such as
      standard laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations and 12-lead
      electrocardiography.
