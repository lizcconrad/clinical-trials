  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients that are on mechanical ventilators in medical intensive care units (MICU) have
      extremely weak leg muscles. Currently there is no treatment to prevent or reverse this
      weakness. Treatments with a thigh muscle stimulator, called an All Stim 2, can improve leg
      muscle strength and help patients regain leg function after knee surgery. The purpose of the
      present study is to determine if treatments with the All Stim 2 device can also improve leg
      muscle strength in patients on mechanical ventilation.

      The objective for this study is to determine if daily exercise using All-Stim 2 stimulation
      of quadriceps muscles will increase leg strength and improve outcomes (duration of
      hospitalization, long term mobility, long term disability) for mechanically ventilated MICU
      patients. The investigators plan to randomize patients accepted into this protocol to
      administration of either sham exercise (i.e. placement of All-Stim 2 units on the legs for 30
      minutes a day without activation of the electrical stimulation program) or active exercise
      (placement of All-Stim 2 electrodes on both legs and stimulating quadriceps muscles to
      rhythmically contract for 30 minutes a day). The two groups (sham and active exercise) will
      be treated for 30 minutes a day for seven days. The effects of exercise on quadriceps
      strength will be assessed by measuring quadriceps force generation (QuadTw) in response to
      magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerves. The QuadTw assessment will be made immediately
      before institution of sham or active exercise and will repeated one day after the conclusion
      of the seven day training regimen. Chart review and patient follow-up will be used to
      determine if this treatment regimen also has an impact on clinical outcome measures, i.e.
      duration of hospitalization.
