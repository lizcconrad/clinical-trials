      The aim of this trial is the surgical method in cesarean deliveries, especially the uterotomy
      closure technique.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized controlled trial was to longitudinally evaluate
      uterine-scar remodeling via transvaginal ultrasound after single- or double-layer uterine
      closure six weeks and at least six months after Cesarean delivery.

      The women were included at their booking visit for an elective CD or during labor before an
      nonemergent CD. They were randomly assigned for three different uterotomy suture techniques:
      The uterus was closed with a continuous single layer locked stitch or continuous single
      unlocked layer or double layer.

      Six weeks and between six and twenty-four month after their cesarean delivery the women were
      examined by transvaginal ultrasound with an empty maternal bladder, in a supine decubitus
      position using a GE E8 system equipped with a 5-9 MHz transducer (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee,
      WI).

      The measurement of the uterine scar thickness was performed perpendicular to the uterine wall
      and was defined as shortest visible distance between the decidua and the delineation of the
      endometrium at the level of the cesarean scar.
