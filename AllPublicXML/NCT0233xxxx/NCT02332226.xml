      The aim of this project is to evaluate a person-centred informational intervention aimed at
      parents of children with cancer.

      The following hypotheses will be tested: an informational intervention emanating from the
      parents' self-identified needs is associated to decreased illness-related parenting stress,
      decreased post-traumatic stress symptoms, increased received knowledge, decreased anxiety,
      decreased depression, increased satisfaction with information, and decreased number of health
      care contacts in parents.

      BACKGROUND

      Parents of children with cancer have great information needs and report that these are not
      always met. Psychosocial suffering such as stress and anxiety is also common in this group.

      INTERVENTION

      The intervention in this study builds upon the representational approach for patient
      education. It emanates from Leventhal's theories about illness representation and educational
      theories about conceptual change. Central elements in the approach are parental choice of
      information topics of interest, and a thorough assessment of present parental knowledge
      before information is given. Each parent in the intervention arm gets four sessions with an
      intervention nurse.

      DESIGN AND METHODS

      The study comprises a multi-centre randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms with a
      1:1 allocation ratio. One arm will receive the intervention and the other standard care
      according to local routines at each ward. The effect will be measured with validated
      instrument which are answered on a web platform. Complementary to the quantitative
      evaluation, we will perform a process evaluation aiming at understanding the change
      mechanisms, treatment fidelity, dose delivered, contextual factors of importance and how the
      intervention further could be optimized.

    <description>Four sessions with a nurse. For each session, the parent identifies an area where he/she needs more information. The nurse and the parent jointly survey the parent's knowledge of the area and discusses consequences of knowledge gaps or misunderstandings. Then, new information is introduced and benefits from the new information is discussed.</description>
