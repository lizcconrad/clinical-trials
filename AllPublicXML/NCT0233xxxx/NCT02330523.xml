      To compare the effectiveness of demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft + cross-linked
      collagen membrane with xenograft + non-cross-linked collagen membrane for posterior
      extraction socket ridge preservation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buccal bony wall loss is a common sequela following tooth extraction, and guided bone
      regeneration (GBR) is a common treatment for the regeneration of ridge form and volume
      preservation allowing dental implant placement. Many bone augmentation biomaterials are
      employed to accomplish GBR, and both the medical/ dental community and, subsequently,
      patients benefit from understanding whether a given GBR biomaterial might be more
      efficacious. To this end, a randomized, case series comparison of allograft + x-linked
      collagen membrane versus xenograft + non-x-linked collagen membrane would be beneficial to
      both the dental community and patients.

      The study compares the effectiveness of demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft + x-linked
      collagen membrane with xenograft + non-x-linked collagen membrane for posterior region
      extraction socket ridge preservation.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New Bone Plus Graft Content at 6-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>New bone and graft content are measured as histomorphometric % vital bone and % mineral (graft remnants) from mid-section bone core biopsies. Histomorphometric analyses are performed with imaging software on composite overview scans. The area of new healing (versus old/ original bony tissues) is demarcated in each section. Within this area, the percentage contributions of each tissue type within the overall area of newly healed tissue is computed, i.e., new bone plus graft content added with connective tissue/ marrow elements totals 100% of the &quot;new healing&quot; area.</description>

        <title>New Bone Plus Graft Content at 6-months</title>
        <description>New bone and graft content are measured as histomorphometric % vital bone and % mineral (graft remnants) from mid-section bone core biopsies. Histomorphometric analyses are performed with imaging software on composite overview scans. The area of new healing (versus old/ original bony tissues) is demarcated in each section. Within this area, the percentage contributions of each tissue type within the overall area of newly healed tissue is computed, i.e., new bone plus graft content added with connective tissue/ marrow elements totals 100% of the &quot;new healing&quot; area.</description>

Guided Bone Regeneration: Following resolution of any periodontal issues in the region of study and administration of pre-surgical antibiotic, minimally traumatic extraction with periotomes and flap reflection will be performed. Test graft materials will be placed according to randomization schedule and in quantity to fill the extraction socket and mimic surrounding ridge dimension. The membranes will be trimmed to extend at least 2 mm beyond the margins of the defect, and soft tissue flaps will be re-approximated using resorbable Vicryl® 6-0.</description>
