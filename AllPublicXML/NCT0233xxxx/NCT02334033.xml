  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease in real-life. Blood pressure and
      kidney functions are known to be closely related. Increased serum level of Cystatin C, a
      sensitive biomarker for renal function, seems to predict adverse cardiovascular events. The
      investigators aimed to evaluate the predictive value of serum Cystatin C for control of
      hypertension in a community-based study.
