  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of VVZ-149 injection after a single dose or loading/maintenance dose in healthy older
      male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VVZ-149 injection, an investigational product (IP) in this clinical study, is a multi-target
      analgesic drug candidate against glycine transporter type II (GlyT2) and serotonin receptor
      2A (5HT2A). The target receptors have been known to play important roles in the induction and
      transmission of pain signals in the pain-related neural system. There have been efforts to
      develop new drugs that selectively antagonize the GlyT2 or 5HT2A, but it was unsuccessful due
      to limitations of single-target drugs. VVZ-149 showed morphine-comparable analgesic and
      gabapentin-comparable anti-allodynic effects in various rat models of pain.
