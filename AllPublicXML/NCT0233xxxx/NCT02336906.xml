  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation treatment has been found to ameliorate symptoms in some patients with lower
      urinary tract dysfunction (including day time or combined day time/night time urinary
      incontinence). This study aims to explore if treatment of patients without overt constipation
      (As defined by the ROME III criteria) will also respond to anti-constipation treatment with
      reduction of their urinary tract symptoms. Assessment of severity and response of lower
      urinary tract dysfunction will be based on the Vancouver NULTD/DES questionnaire.
