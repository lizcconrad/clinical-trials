  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluating whether autologous grafted fat transplantation or
      SVF transplantation is safe and/or effective to accelerating skin regeneration and soft
      tissue expansion.

    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of large scale skin defect is a challenge to clinical surgeons. Soft tissue
      expansion has won wide attention in recent years as it promotes skin regeneration with
      perfectly matched tissue. However, some patients with poor skin regenerative ability would
      suffer from skin flap over-thinned and even necrosis under the continuous stretching by
      silicone expander. This study is to evaluate the effects of autologous fat graft/SVF
      transplantation on accelerating skin regeneration and promoting tissue expansion process.

      Patients aged between 18 to 60 years old who appear with deteriorated expanded skin will be
      enrolled and randomized into three groups, named as the experimental group and the control
      group. Patients from the FAT-GRAFT group will have a liposuction and subdermal fat graft
      transplantation. Patients from the SVF-TRANSPLANTATION group will have a liposuction and SVF
      will be separated and transplanted intradermally to expanded skin. Patients from the control
      group will have saline injection.
