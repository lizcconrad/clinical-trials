      This is a single arm, open-labelled study to determine the effectiveness of combination
      Cinacalcet with Vitamin D analogue in the treatment of severe hyperparathyroidism in patients
      with ESRF on haemodialysis. Patients will be started on PO Cinacalcet 25mg OD + PO/IV active
      Vitamin D analogues adjusted by increments/decrements in steps of 1 mcg 3x per week every 1-4
      weeks until the corrected calcium level is within 2.4-2.54 mmol/L. After iPTH has reached
      2-9x ULN, patient enters maintenance phase. If serum calcium falls below 2.1mmol/L, active
      Vit D dose will be increased and if it is above 2.54 mmol/L, the dose will be decreased.

      Percentage reduction of iPTH levels from baseline at 6,12 and 24 months treatment and
      Percentage of patients achieving iPTH levels within the target range of 2-9x upper limit
      normal at 6, 12 and 24 months will be determined

    <textblock>
      Many patients on haemodialysis will develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D
      analogues such as alphacalcidol are needed to bring their iPTH levels down to normal.
      However, these analogues can cause hypercalcaemia, thus its doses are limited by this effect.
      Cinacalcet, which is currently not widely available to patients in hospitals, is a
      calcimimetic that can reduce both iPTH and serum calcium levels. No studies have yet to be
      carried out investigating the outcome of using low doses of Cinacalcet as a means of
      optimizing doses of vitamin D analogues by keeping calcium levels from going over the upper
      limit. So a single arm, open-labelled study has been designed to determine the effectiveness
      of combination Cinacalcet with Vitamin D analogue in the treatment of severe
      hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRF on haemodialysis. No formal sample size calculation
      was done as this is a proof of concept study. Power calculation will be done at the end based
      on the primary outcome of the study.

      Methodology: Patients will be started on PO Cinacalcet 25mg OD + PO/IV active Vitamin D
      analogues adjusted by increments/decrements in steps of 1 mcg 3x per week every 1-4 weeks
      until the corrected calcium level is within 2.4-2.54 mmol/L. After iPTH has reached 2-9x ULN,
      patient enters maintenance phase. If serum calcium falls below 2.1mmol/L, active Vit D dose
      will be increased and if it is above 2.54 mmol/L, the dose will be decreased.

      Percentage reduction of iPTH levels from baseline at 6,12 and 24 months treatment and
      Percentage of patients achieving iPTH levels within the target range of 2-9x upper limit
      normal at 6, 12 and 24 months will be determined.
