    <textblock>
      The aim is to assess pelvic floor symptoms and quality of life in elderly women. The study is
      conducted as population-based in 100-130 women at the age of 64-66 years. All study objects
      are examined gynecologically and with vaginal ultrasound. Subjective symptoms are evaluated
      with validated questionnaires concerning pelvic floor symptoms, sexual symptoms and quality
      of life. This is a pilot study before a larger scale population-based study.
