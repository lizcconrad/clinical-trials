      Background/Aims:

      The investigators explored the therapeutic effects of probiotics in patients with AH.

      Methods:

      Between December 2012 and January 2015, the investigators conducted a 7-day,
      double-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of
      probiotics in improving liver enzymes, LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, stool culture, and
      stool Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. AH was defined as an
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 and elevated AST (ALT)
      level with an alcohol consumption history within 48 hours. Patients were randomized to
      receive 7 days of cultured Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011/acidophilus R0052 (120 mg/day) or
      placebo. The levels of liver enzymes, modified Discriminant Function (mDF), LPS, and
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, stool culture, and stool Polymerase chain reaction denaturing
      gradient gel electrophoresis were checked at baseline and again after therapy.

      Background/Aims: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the leading causes of liver diseases.
      Gut-derived microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been known as a central role in the
      pathogenesis of AH. Some animal studies suggested an emerging role of probiotics in
      restoration of the bowel flora and improving liver enzymes. We explored the therapeutic
      effects of probiotics in patients with AH.

      Between December 2012 and January 2015, the investigators conducted a 7-day,
