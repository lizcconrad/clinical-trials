  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune Activation persists in HIV-1 infected patients despite efficient antiretroviral
      treatment. This immune activation is responsible for immune deficiency as well as for
      non-AIDS related comorbidities, such as non-alcoholic Fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome
      or osteoporosis. The goal of this observational transversal multicentric study is to
      establish the etiologic factors of persistent immune activation in treated HIV-1 infected
      patients (persistent de novo infection of T CD4+ cells, microbial translocation, active
      coinfections, immunosenescence, T CD4+ cells lymphopenia, Treg deficiency), its different
      forms ( activation of T CD4+ cells, T CD8+ cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, granulocytes,
      platelets, endothelial cells or general inflammation) and the potential correlation between
      causes, forms of immune activation and emergent comorbidities (kidney, bone or liver
      dysfunction, metabolic syndrome).

      causes, forms of immune activation and emergent comorbidities (kidney, bone or liver
      dysfunction, metabolic syndrome). These correlations could highlight physiopathologic
      mechanisms relating a specific cause of immune activation, activation of a specific
      subpopulation of immune cells and a comorbidity. Physiopathologic mechanisms could then be
      tested in vitro and lead into new therapeutic tracks of immune activation secondary to HIV-1
      or to the natural ageing process.
