  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial, the purpose of which is to
      determine if patients age 25 and younger who undergo medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL)
      reconstruction have lower rates of recurrent instability compared to those treated
      non-operatively. The MPFL is a ligament that stabilizes the kneecap, and maintains its proper
      position in the groove on the femur (thighbone). Instability refers to a situation in which
      the kneecap moves out of place, or dislocates. When instability is recurrent, it occurs more
      than once in the same knee.

    <textblock>
      A total of 240 patients will be enrolled across participating sites around the country. These
      sites currently include: The Hospital for Special Surgery, Oregon Health and Science
      University, Inova Sports Medicine, and Mayo Clinic. Patients are randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment groups. Patients assigned to the &quot;stabilization&quot; group will undergo surgery to
      reconstruct the MPFL using either a hamstring tendon that is your own or one obtained from a
      donor. Patients assigned to the &quot;conservative&quot; group will be treated with physical therapy,
      and possibly a simple knee arthroscopy if you are found to have a loose fragment on x-ray or
      MRI. All patients will be required to return for follow-up visits, which will continue over
      the course of 5 years. During these visits, patients will be examined, asked to answer
      questions about their surgery and general health, and have imaging (x-ray and MRI) performed
      on the knee. All patients enrolled in this study will undergo a standardized, intensive
      rehabilitation protocol. The investigators anticipate that all patients may benefit from
      extensive rehabilitation, including strengthening and return to sport training. The knowledge
      gained from this study may benefit others in the future.

    <measure>Recurrence of patellar instability</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is recurrent episode of patellar instability within 5 years following the primary patellofemoral dislocation event. A preliminary analysis will be performed at 2 years to examine for any early results of the study. Patellar instability will be defined as any patient-reported episode of subluxation or dislocation following the index event. Subluxation or dislocation will be defined as a feeling of dissociation of the patella from its trochlear groove. Subluxation will be noted if the patella spontaneously reduces into the groove, and dislocation will be noted if the patella requires any change in position or force (i.e. extending the knee or exerting a medially-directed force on the patella) in order to reduce into its trochlear groove. (Apprehension will not be classified as subluxation unless the patient specifically notes a sensation of departure of the patella from its trochlear groove at some point during the experience.)</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The surgical intervention to be studied in this arm is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction surgery using hamstring tendon. The tendon used will generally consist of autograft semitendinosus. If the hamstrings have been previously harvested or injured (i.e. in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction or proximal tibial surgery), or if the patient/his or her family prefers to minimize donor site morbidity, allograft may be used.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Conservative treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention to be studied in this arm is a rehabilitation program directed by physical therapists. If patients in this arm are found to have a small loose body, a simple arthroscopy will be performed to remove the loose body, but no stabilization of the patellofemoral joint will be performed. The rehabilitation program will be compiled into a booklet and distributed for use by the physical therapist chosen by the patient.</description>
