      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that sarilumab monotherapy was superior to adalimumab monotherapy with respect
      to signs and symptoms as assessed by disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were
      either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued treatment with
      methotrexate (MTX), or after at least 12 weeks of continued treatment with MTX, were
      determined to be inadequate responders.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To demonstrate that sarilumab monotherapy was superior to adalimumab monotherapy in
      participants with active RA who were either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate
      candidates for continued treatment with MTX, or after at least 12 weeks of continued
      treatment with MTX, were determined to be inadequate responders, with respect to:

        -  Reduction of signs and symptoms of RA.

        -  Improvement in quality of life assessed by participant reported outcome questionnaires.

      Assessment of the safety and tolerability of sarilumab monotherapy (including immunogenicity)
      throughout the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 86 centers in 15 countries. A total of 540 participants were screened between 28 January 2015 and 09 July 2015, of whom 369 participants were randomized and 171 were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to exclusion criteria met and inclusion criteria not met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio (Adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks [q2w]: Sarilumab 200 mg q2w) and treated for 24 weeks. Completers are those participants who completed 24 weeks randomized treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with placebo for sarilumab q2w for 24 weeks during randomized treatment period. The dosing frequency of adalimumab may be adjusted to 40 mg every week (qw) dosing in case of participants with inadequate response (&lt;20% improvement from baseline tender joint count [TJC] and swollen joint count [SJC] for 2 consecutive visits) at or after Week 16 until Week 23. Participants completed 24 weeks treatment period had the option to continue in open-label treatment period and received sarilumab 200 mg q2w until commercial availability of sarilumab in the country or maximum of 276 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>DAS28-ESR is a composite score that includes 4 variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based on 28 joints); General health (GH) assessment by the participant assessed from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) core set questionnaire (participant global assessment) in 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS); Marker of inflammation assessed by ESR in mm/hr. The DAS28-ESR score provides a number indicating the current disease activity of the RA. DAS28-ESR total score ranges from 2-10. A DAS28-ESR score above 5.1 means high disease activity, DAS28-ESR score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity and DAS28-ESR score below 2.6 means disease remission. Least square (LS) mean and standard error (SE) at Week 24 were obtained using Mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire consisting of 8 sub-scales, measures health-related quality of life (HRQL) in the last 4 weeks covering 2 summary measures: PCS and mental component summary (MCS). PCS with 4 sub-scales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception; and MCS with 4 sub-scales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a sub-scale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same sub-scale give the sub-scale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Both PCS and MCS range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better physical and mental health. LS mean and SE at Week 24 by MMRM approach.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 - Mental Health Component Summary Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire consisting of 8 sub-scales, measures HRQL in the last 4 weeks covering 2 summary measures: PCS and MCS. PCS with 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception; and MCS with 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same sub-scale give the sub-scale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Both PCS and MCS range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better physical and mental health. LS mean and SE at Week 24 by MMRM approach.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Low Disease Activity (DAS28-ESR &lt; 3.2) at Week 24</title>
          <description>DAS28-ESR is a composite score that includes 4 variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based on 28 joints); GH assessment by the participant assessed from the ACR RA core set questionnaire (participant global assessment) in 100 mm VAS; Marker of inflammation assessed by ESR in mm/hr. The DAS28-ESR score provides a number indicating the current disease activity of the RA. DAS28-ESR total score ranges from 2-10. A DAS28-ESR score above 5.1 means high disease activity, DAS28-ESR score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity and DAS28-ESR score below 2.6 means disease remission. Participants were analyzed as non-responders from the time they discontinued treatment.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, generic measure of health outcome. EQ-5D was designed for self-completion by participants. EQ-5D specifically included to address concerns regarding the health economic impact of RA. EQ-5D-3L comprises of 5 questions on mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, usual activities, and psychological status with 3 possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problems, 3=severe problems). The 5-dimensional 3-level systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 to 1, where higher score indicates a better health state. EQ-5D-3L-VAS records the participant’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS that allows the participants to indicate their health state that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained using MMRM approach.</description>

        <description>The WPS-RA is a validated questionnaire that evaluates productivity limitations within work and within home associated with RA over the previous month. The questionnaire is interviewer-administered and based on participant self-report. It contains 9 questions addressing employment status (1 item), productivity at work (3 items), and within and outside the home (5 items). Number of days with outside help hired in the last month by the participant was reported. LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained using MMRM approach.</description>

        <description>ACR components were: TJC, SJC, physician global VAS, participant global VAS, pain VAS, HAQ-DI &amp; acute phase reactant (hs-CRP and ESR levels). The ESR is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response. LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained using MMRM approach.</description>
