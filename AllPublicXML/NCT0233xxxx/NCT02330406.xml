    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Anagliptin or Sitagliptin are effective in
      reducing the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular risk factors on statin.

      Diabetes is a significant cause of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Especially,
      diabetic patients with cardiovascular risk factors were significantly higher risk for
      cardiovascular and cerebrovasculara event. Therefore, several medical management strategies
      including anti-diabetic medications and statins were considered for those patients. However,
      in spite of such treatment, still many patients have cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      events. One of the hypothesis is the residual risk such as elevated low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDLC) even with statin therapy. Anagliptin, one of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4
      (DPP4) inhibiors, was reported to reduce LDLC and may have pontential to decrease the
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk for such patients on statins. We, thus, conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to compare Anagliptin or Sitagliptin in terms of change of LDLC
      for 52 weeks as well as glycemic control.
