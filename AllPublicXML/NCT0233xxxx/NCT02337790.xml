  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study had the following objectives:

        1. Verify that the CoVa Monitoring System does not interfere with implanted devices.

        2. Verify that implanted devices do not interfere with the functions of the CoVa Monitoring
           System.

        3. Verify that the CoVa Monitoring System fits on a wide variety of body types.
