  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic gastrectomy became a good option for early gastric cancer. Surgical trend is
      gradually changed to totally laparoscopic gastrectomy from laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy
      requiring mini-laparotomy. Various types of intracorporeal anastomosis have been introduced
      for esophagojejunostomy during total gastrectomy. We invented a novel anastomosis method
      using linear stapler for total gastrectomy. Three procedures (Jejunal resection, esophageal
      resection and closure of common entry hole after anastomosis) was performed with only one
      stapler. Therefore, the novel method is simple and fast. Also, this new technique is better
      economically than previously introduced anastomosis using linear stapler because lesser
      number of stapler is required. We want to demonstrate the feasibility of novel intracorporeal
      anastomosis method during laparoscopic total gastrectomy.

    <description>Under laparoscopic view, esophagojejunostomy was pereformed with 60mm linear stapler on right side of distal esophagus like as functional end-to-end fashion before esophageal and jejunal resection. Then, three procedures of esophageal resection, common entry hole closure and jejunal resection was performed with a single use of 60mm stapler. Also, jejunojejunostomy was also performed via already made staple entry hole.</description>
