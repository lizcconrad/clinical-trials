  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the POGO® system delivers accurate blood glucose
      readings in the hands of the lay user and assess the POGO® system accuracy when used by
      trained health care professionals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will review labeling materials and self-test using the POGO® system. An HCP-assisted
      test also will be performed; both tests will be compared to a fingerstick capillary sample
      run on a YSI reference glucose analyzer. Subjects will complete questionnaires on labeling
      comprehension and POGO® usability.
