  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Body weight is not well regulated in all individuals. In an obesogenic
      environment, where overeating is common, some individuals are more prone to weight gain and
      therefore overweight than others. Yet, the reasons behind this are unclear. &quot;Resistant&quot;
      individuals often have higher physical activity levels (PALs). It seems that - at higher
      levels of physical activity and therefore energy expenditure - satiety signals are more
      precisely regulated, making one better at matching energy intake with expenditure. In other
      words, active people may not overeat where sedentary people would. However, this does not
      explain the differences in weight gain observed when subjects all have to overeat (imposed
      overfeeding). It could be that active people are better able to cope metabolically with the
      extra calories because of already higher levels of carbohydrate and fat oxidation compared to
      their inactive counterparts.

      Objectives: 1/ To study the effects of overfeeding (normal diet composition) on substrate
      balance and oxidation and more specifically fat balance and oxidation; 2/ to study the
      effects of exercise and training on fat oxidation during overfeeding (normal diet
      composition).

      Study design: This controlled intervention study will follow a cross-over design. Each
      subject will spend 5 nights and 4 days in a respiration chamber on two occasions, separated
      by a 10-week training period.
