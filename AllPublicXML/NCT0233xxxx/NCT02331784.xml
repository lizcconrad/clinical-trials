  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the experimental treatment
      (cognitive training) further outlined in this protocol on the cognitive abilities (e.g.,
      processing speed, attention, working memory, and executive function), brain functionality,
      functional status and quality of life of individuals with age-related cognitive decline as
      compared to a computer-based active control.

    <textblock>
      The normal aging has a devastating effect on our cognitive ability to learn and remember, on
      the speed with which the investigators process information, and on our ability to reason. By
      2050, nearly 14 million individuals in the US will be living with Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      up from 5 million in 2013. AD is the most common cause of dementia, resulting in the loss of
      cognitive functions such as memory, reasoning, language, and cognitive, social, physical, and
      emotional control, to the extent that losses interfere with activities of daily living and
      necessitate continuous monitoring and care. Many studies now show that the processing
      machinery of the brain is plastic and remodeled throughout life by learning and experience,
      enabling the strengthening of cognitive skills or abilities. Research has shown that brief,
      daily computerized cognitive training that is sufficiently challenging, goal-directed and
      adaptive enables intact brain structures to restore balance in attention and compensate for
      disruptions in cognitive functioning. The study aims to understand how our computer program
      can affect cognition and attention in those with aging brain.

    <description>Change in resting state functional connectivity will be measured by resting State T2*weighted EPI-BOLD, a 10-minute task-free BOLD contrast sequence consisting of 300 volumes (TR=2000 ms/TE=30ms) at 3.4mm3 in-plane resolution and 3mm slice thickness. Participants will be instructed to keep their eyes open and maintain attention on a central gray fixation cross on a black screen.</description>
