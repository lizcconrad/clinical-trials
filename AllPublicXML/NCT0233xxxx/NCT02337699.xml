  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      25-SMI-2014 is a post market observational, questionnaire based study to assess the
      effectiveness of the Axium neurostimulator as a treatment for chronic post surgical groin
      pain. Within is also a nested feasibility study to assess the clinical utility of a
      Quantitive Sensory Testing (QST) protocol in the management of the described study group.
