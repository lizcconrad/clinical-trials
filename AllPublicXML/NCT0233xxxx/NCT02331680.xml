      This is a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of OPC-41061 by 24-week oral
      administration of OPC-41061 at 15-mg or 30-mg or placebo in patients with chronic renal
      failure who are undergoing hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration and who have daily urine volume
      of at least 500 mL/day.
