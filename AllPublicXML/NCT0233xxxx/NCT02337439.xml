    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with schizophrenia and schizoaffective are given computer
      exercises to complete. The goals of the study are to determine whether: 1) any of the
      computer exercises can improve information processing problems in schizophrenia, 2)
      improvements in information processing are related to other cognitive improvements, and 3)
      there are changes in brain activity associated with using the computer exercises.

      The study will involve clinical interviews, cognitive tests, and frequent computerized
      cognitive training over the course of 2 months. Some participants will also have
      electroencephalography, a non-invasive test that measures brain activity, to determine
      whether there are changes in brain activity with the computer training.

      Schizophrenia is a disabling neurodevelopmental illness, affecting nearly 1% of the
      population. The disability of schizophrenia is due in large part to the effects of the
      illness on cognitive faculties. Current medications for schizophrenia do not generally
      improve cognition, so a major contribution to disability remains undertreated. Computerized
      cognitive remediation programs, which produce activity-dependent recruitment of neural
      resources to specifically enhance under-functioning brain systems, have been effective at
      improving both cognition and community functioning in patients with schizophrenia, but the
      effects are still modest. Our preliminary work has suggested that our training is associated
      with improvements in visual memory, though visual memory has been a cognitive area more
      refractory to cognitive training.

      In this study, participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be randomized
      to receive different computer exercises to help determine whether computer exercises can
      improve memory in schizophrenia, and whether the cognitive training is associated with
      changes in neural activity.
