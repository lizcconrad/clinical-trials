  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project seeks to study the use of an navigator-based intervention called &quot;PICU Supports.&quot;
      The study will test the impact of PICU Supports during and after PICU discharge on parent
      outcomes (satisfaction with decision making, decision regret, anxiety, depression,
      post-traumatic stress, health-related quality of life, and complicated bereavement) and on
      parent and healthcare team member assessments of communication and team collaboration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children admitted to the PICU often face challenging decisions. Research
      demonstrates deficiencies in communication in the PICU which could impact decision making.
      This study team has developed a navigator-based intervention call PICU Supports. PICU
      Supports aims to provide the following types of support to parents of patients in the PICU:
      emotional; communication (between healthcare team members and parents/families as well as
      among healthcare team members ); decision making; transitions out of the PICU (i.e. discharge
      transitions to a non-PICU hospital bed, a long term care facility, or home); and information.
      Support is accomplished by navigator engagement with parents and healthcare team members and
      the guided use of navigator supported ancillary tools provided to parents and healthcare team
      members as needed. During the patient's PICU stay, the navigator activities and use of
      ancillary tools is directed by the family's needs. Thus PICU Supports uses a predefined
      framework of activities and tools to provide individualized support directed by the needs of
      the parent and the patient situation. This research will test PICU Supports in the clinical
      setting. This will be accomplished by conducting a pilot study of PICU Supports at Ann &amp;
      Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Lurie Children's Hospital), followed by a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention, PICU Supports, to a control,
      parental receipt of an educational brochure. The RCT will be conducted at Lurie Children's
      Hospital and at University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospital (Comer Children's
      Hospital).

    <description>The PICU Supports intervention includes navigator activities and ancillary tools. The Navigator activities include: initial visits with the healthcare team members (HTMs) and parents; weekday visits with the parents and feedback to the HTMs as needed; coordination of weekly family meetings between the parents and HTMs; and support during transitions out of the unit. The ancillary tools include: a PICU handbook; a place for parents to keep track of events and their goals; a provider sheet to inform PICU HTMs about important parental issues, concerns or goals; a bedside communication log so parents know which non-PICU HTMs have visited; an end-of-life checklist; a bereavement packet for those whose child dies; and informational resources.</description>
