  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of both Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and stroke doubles each decade over 65 years
      old. Both are major causes of dementia, currently estimated to affect 46 million people
      worldwide. The current costs globally are $818 billion. Additionally, in population studies
      elders over 65 years, &quot;covert&quot; cerebral small vessel disease appears on MRI scans as silent
      lacunar infarcts in 25% as Microbleeds in 10%, and as focal or diffuse 'incidental' white
      matter disease (WMD) in 95%. WMD is extensive in 20%, with a clinical threshold effect around
      10cc2. Small vessel disease is even more common in dementia, often coexisting with AD and
      independently contributing to cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Longitudinal
      imaging using cerebral amyloid labeling opens a new opportunity to understand the
      additive/interactive effects of small vessel disease and AD.

      The design of this study includes recruitment of two cohorts, including Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI) and/or early Alzheimer Disease subjects from memory clinics and subjects
      with strokes/TIA from stroke prevention clinics. Inclusion criteria include the presence of
      moderate/extensive white matter disease, eg. Fazekas score of 2 (with confluent
      peri-ventricular hyperintensities) or Fazekas score of 3, as determined by previous MR or CT,
      &gt; 60 years of age, Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) scores ≥ 20. Subjects will undergo 3T
      structural MRI (including T1, PD/T2, FLAIR, GRE, DTI, ASL, and resting state fMRI), glucose
      PET, amyloid PET (using AV-45 florbetapir) and neuropsychological testing, as well as blood
      sampling. Repeat MR and PET/CT imaging and neuropsychological testing will be conducted at 24
      months. The imaging portion is designed to closely parallel the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) in order to benefit from the availability of both cognitively
      normal controls (NC), MCI and Alzheimer's disease subjects with minimal WMD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a multi-center trial to be conducted in centers across Canada and
      approximately 80 patients will be enrolled. Participants will be recruited from both stroke
      prevention (N=40) and memory clinics (N=40). For comparison, we will access the
      publically-available data using a very similar protocol being collected from normal controls
      (N=250), MCI (N=250 early MCI, N=150 late MCI) and AD patients (N=150) without significant
      white matter disease, who are participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI-GO and ADNI 2, N=800), to choose representative samples for comparison to
      those with scores ≤ 1 who represent the non-white matter disease group.

      Three imaging modalities will be used with each participant. 3 Telsa MRI scans will be
      acquired, using an ADNI based protocol, except for the addition of a PD/T2 interleved
      sequence. Participants will also undergo 18-fluoro PET with the AVID-45 ligand and
      18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET using the ADNI protocols.

      The primary objectives are to characterize at baseline and 2-year follow-up in patients with
      significant Periventricular White Matter Hyperintensities (pvWMH), presenting as transient
      cerebrovascular events or memory problems, patterns of: 1. Uptake of amyloid on Florbetapir
      F-18 PET/CT 2. Glucose uptake on 18F-FDG PET/CT 3. Volumetric measures of brain structure on
      MRI imaging 4. Performance on standard neuropsychological assessments, activities of daily
      living and gait speed.

      Secondary objectives are to: 1. Compare the relationship between amyloid brain uptake, pvWMH
      volumes, and cognitive scores in patients with significant pvWMH and a control group of
      individuals that are cognitively normal, MCI or AD, with mild pvWMH, identified from the ADNI
      database. 2. Examine the relationship between amyloid uptake, ApoE e4 genotype, and
      structural MRI volumes in patients with a high burden of pvWMH. 3. Evaluate the utility of
      baseline brain amyloid to predict cognitive decline and increases in pvWMH volume at 2 years
      follow up. 4. Evaluate the safety of a single intravenous dose of Florbetapir F 18 Injection
      (370 MBq +/- 10%) in subjects with significant pvWMH.
