  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and optimal dose of cannabidiol
      (CBD) as an simultaneous treatment in children and young adults with Sturge-Weber syndrome
      (SWS) and drug resistant epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hope to gain an understanding of the utility of pure CBD used for the treatment of
      medically refractory epilepsy in SWS in this open-label, safety dose-finding, study. Recent
      evidence suggests that CBD has multiple, beneficial, effects in patients (such as those with
      SWS that undergo neurological deterioration) suffering from medically refractory seizures. We
      hypothesize that CBD will reduce seizure frequency in children and young adults with SWS and
      will therefore help stabilize and improve their neurologic status.This trial is part of an
      expanded access program, available through a partnership with GW Pharmaceutical, which has
      been sanctioned by the FDA to study the safety and efficacy of Epidiolex (cannabidiol/CBD) in
      participants with SWS and medically refractory seizures.

    <description>All subjects will receive the experimental Epidiolex (cannabidiol) oral solution to be taken at home twice a day, and will be treated on an outpatient basis. The drug will be taken for 48 weeks unless the subject chooses to participate in the extension phase of the study, in which case the subject will continue to receive the drug for one additional year or until the drug is approved for clinical use for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.</description>

    <description>Initiation of treatment will begin with 2mg/kg/day. The dose will be increased by 3 mg/kg/day after seven days and then by 5 mg/kg/day every seven days up to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/day given.
The dose of concomitant antiepileptic drugs will remain unchanged during the first 12 weeks of CBD treatment (or until 8 weeks after steady state at final dose), unless symptoms of toxicity and/or significant changes in blood levels are observed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: Participants with Sturge-Weber syndrome brain involvement as defined on
        neuroimaging (n=10 subjects, male and female, ages 1 month to 45 years of age) and the
        following:

          -  Documentation of a diagnosis of drug resistant epilepsy as evidenced by failure to
             control seizures despite appropriate trial of two or more AEDs at therapeutic doses.
             Drug resistant epilepsy for this study is defined as: At least 1 reported quantifiable
             (no cluster or innumerable) defined seizure with motor signs per month for at least 3
             months prior to initial visit and during the period between Visit 1 (Screening Visit)
             and Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), as per data captured in daily seizure diaries. These can
             be focal seizures, focal seizures with impaired consciousness, myoclonic seizures,
             generalized, and secondarily generalized seizures.

          -  Between 1-5 baseline anti-epileptic drugs at stable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment. Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), ketogenic diet and modified Atkins
             diet do not count toward this limit.

          -  VNS must be on stable settings for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  If on ketogenic or Atkins diet, must be on stable ratio for a minimum of 3 months
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Previous subjects who failed at any point to meet continuation criteria and withdrew
             early may be considered for re-enrollment under a new subject ID as long as the above
             inclusion criteria are met. The determination of whether to re-enroll will be made by
             the PI and sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Re-enrollment can occur no earlier than 4
             weeks after the final, post-weaning follow-up visit under the old subject ID.

        Written informed consent obtained from the patient or the patient's legal representative
        must be obtained prior to beginning treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with seizures secondary to metabolic, toxic, infectious or psychogenic
             disorder or drug abuse or current seizures related to an acute medical illness.

          -  Presence of only non-motor partial seizures (without limb or facial movements, eye
             deviation or head turning)

          -  Patients who require rescue medication during the Baseline phase for more than 6 days.

          -  Patients with any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions at randomization such
             as:

               1. liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and chronic
                  hepatitis [i.e. quantifiable hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA and/or positive HbsAg,
                  quantifiable hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA]

               2. Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt; 1.5

               3. Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections.

               4. Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis.

          -  Patients who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks
             of study entry. Patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major
             surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia), or patients that may require major
             surgery during the course of the study.

          -  Patients who change the dose of the AEDs during 4 weeks before screening or during the
             baseline period.

          -  Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks prior to
             study entry.

          -  Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study. Those in
             foster care, unable to keep follow-up appointments, maintain close contact with
             Principal Investigator, or complete all necessary studies to maintain safety.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test.
