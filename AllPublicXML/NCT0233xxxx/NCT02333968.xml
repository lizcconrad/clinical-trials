  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with cancer, having an enormous
      impact on functioning and quality of life. Integration of patient self-management and
      professional care by means of care technology provides new opportunities in the outpatient
      setting. In this project a technology based and nurse delivered multicomponent
      self-management support intervention has been developed. Important components include
      monitoring, feedback, education, and nurse support. Following feasibility evaluation, the
      primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of the intervention
      regarding pain intensity and quality of life as compared to care as usual. Secondary outcomes
      of the effect evaluation are self-efficacy, knowledge, anxiety and depression, and pain
      medication use. Besides, a cost-evaluation and summative process evaluation will be
      performed.

    <description>The 12-week intervention consists of an iPad application for patients that is connected to a web application for nurses. Every morning and evening patients register pain and related symptoms by use of a pain diary. Patients are also requested to register medication intake. Graphical feedback is provided based on registered pain scores and medication intakes. Patients receive education on causes and treatment of pain, symptoms that require action, and methods to better control pain. Patients communicate with nurses via text message functionality within the application. Specialized nurses remotely monitor and analyze the patients' situation once every workday. Nurses have the opportunity to collaborate with the treating physician, pain specialist or multidisciplinary team.</description>
