      This study includes a novel intervention entitled &quot;ADHERE,&quot; which includes one
      semi-structured 30-minute face-to-face session and three 10-minute weekly phone sessions over
      4 weeks, administered by an advanced practice nurse (APRN) to promote management of symptoms
      and adherence in patients prescribed oral anti-cancer agents. Innovations in cancer treatment
      are changing the treatment delivery landscape. It is projected that by 2015, 25% of treatment
      will be delivered in pill form. This shift in the treatment paradigm places greater
      responsibility on patients. However, patients with cancer are known to miss as much as
      one-third of the prescribed doses of oral agents required for treatment of their disease.
      Barriers to oral agent adherence include symptom severity, low self-efficacy, depressive
      symptoms, lack of motivation, or beliefs that the medicine will not help, age, and regimen
      complexity. The therapeutic outcome for those taking oral agents depends heavily on the
      ability of patients to adhere to the prescribed regimen. Thus, a critical need exists to test
      interventions that promote adherence and symptom management in patients taking oral agents.

      ADHERE provides systematic patient education (PE) with the investigators evidence-based
      Medication Management and Symptom Management Toolkit (Toolkit). This is combined with brief
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to focus thoughts and beliefs to influence action; and
      motivational interviewing (MI) to elicit reasons from patients to take action. The National
      Cancer Institute (NCI), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and Oncology Nursing
      Society (ONS) have made adherence to oral agents a priority. Thus, the investigators are
      testing ADHERE's impact on symptom severity and adherence to the oral agent regimen and
      determining the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention among patients with cancer.

      Purpose/Aims: Over 50 oral agents in pill form are currently on the market, with projections
      that in three years, 25% of cancer treatment will be delivered in pill form with patients
      assuming responsibility for self-management at home. For oral agents to achieve a
      therapeutically effective level for cancer treatment, patients must strictly adhere to the
      regimen. Adherence to oral cancer agents is often less than 80%, which may be inadequate for
      treating the cancer. The aim of this study is to refine and determine the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of an intervention (entitled &quot;ADHERE&quot;) that uses motivational
      interviewing (MI) to elicit reasons to adhere and brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as
      a mechanism for goal-oriented systematic patient education (PE) to promote adherence and
      symptom management among cancer patients prescribed oral agents. Significance: This study
      targets a challenging clinical problem among patients with a life-threatening disease,
      assisting them in adhering to and completing their cancer treatment, impacting symptoms,
      quality of life, and longevity. Framework: The Motivation and Behavior Skills Model guides
      this work. The model asserts even a well informed or highly motivated patient will have
      difficulty achieving and sustaining optimal adherence if they lack the skills required to
      acquire or self-manage or feel incapable of performing such behaviors. Main Variables:
      Adherence and symptom severity. Methods: This practice-based study will be conducted using a
      4-week intervention (ADHERE) to promote adherence and symptom management in patients newly
      prescribed oral agents in two phases. Phase 1 will use a single-subject-design to
      consecutively enrolling 5-patients from a cancer center over 4-weeks and investigators will
      use an iterative process to refine ADHERE in a practice-based setting. Phase 2 will use an
      8-week quasi-experimental sequential design, enrolling 60-patients (30 intervention &amp; 30
      control) from 2-cancer centers to examine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 4-week
      ADHERE intervention and follow-up for 4-weeks to assess adherence and symptom management.
      Descriptive statistics will be provided as appropriate for all data collected, and 95%
      confidence intervals will be provided by using exact method for outcome variables, such as:
      the proportion of patients who are enrolled to participate in the study among those who are
      recruited; the proportion of ADHERE received by the patient over the four-week time period;
      and the proportion of patients who report high satisfaction with ADHERE. Exploratory analysis
      of efficacy as measured weekly by proportion of pills taken compared to what was prescribed.
      Implications: This study has the potential to have a transformative impact on oral agent
      adherence by developing an advanced practice registered nurse-led strategy to promote
      adherence among the increasing number of cancer patients who receive their cancer treatment
      in pill form. This intervention will lead to standardized care for patients newly prescribed
      oral agents. Results of this study will be used to inform the development of an R01
      application to conduct a larger randomized trial to test the efficacy of this innovative
      intervention.

    <description>ADHERE entails a face-to-face 30 minute session during week 1 while in the clinic/office and three subsequent ADHERE phone calls for 10 minutes each, weekly during weeks 2-4 to promote symptom management and adherence to their oral agent regimen. The face-to-face intervention and phone interactions will consist of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interaction strategies. Each patient will be given a Medication Management and Symptoms Management Toolkit, to assist with symptom management at home.
All patients (intervention and control) receive weekly assessments of symptom severity and oral agent adherence (weeks 2-7). At exit (week 8), all patients receive an assessment of depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, beliefs, motivation, symptom severity, and adherence.</description>
