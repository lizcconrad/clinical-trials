      The aim of the study was to evaluate the Efficacy of Education With Balance Exercise in
      Reducing Fear of Falls in Elderly Population . In the present study the educational program
      along with balance training was delivered to group A, (Experimental group) and only Balance
      training was delivered to group B, (Control group) for 6 weeks for 1 hr duration once weekly.
      Education program included education about the risk factors of falls such as environmental
      hazards, importance of good nutrition, use of stick while walking, avoiding slippery
      surfaces. Balance training consists of stance activities and balance exercise program. The
      outcome measures for this intervention were Activities specific balance confidence scale and
      berg balance scale.

      Present study was an experimental design. A total of 60 elderly subjects were selected as per
      the selection criteria and they were randomly allocated in two equal groups i.e.Group A-
      (Experimental Group)- Balance Exercises and Education Program Group B - (Control Group) -
      Balance exercises.procedure of study was explained to each subject and written consent was
      taken from them.

    <description>Group A received education programme as well as balance training exercises.The intervention group attended one-hour training classes once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. The classes involved both lectures and discussions and were guided through with handouts and worksheets. Each session began by giving a summary of the previous session and continued with the main topic of the session. The intervention program also engaged the participants in discussions about their concerns regarding falling and on topics pertaining to identifying and reducing the risk factors of falls, including environmental hazards in and out of the house</description>
