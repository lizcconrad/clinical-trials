      Introduction:

      Advances in modern medicine have led to people living longer and healthier lives. Frailty is
      an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery. When
      it comes to CABG surgery, randomized controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on
      low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on
      frail patients.

      Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique in patients with
      limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress. In this study, the authors
      introduce the new national, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial &quot;FRAGILE&quot;, to be
      developed in the main cardiac surgery centers of Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of
      off-pump CABG in frail patients.

      Methods:

      FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individually randomized (1:1) controlled
      trial which will enroll 630 patients with blinded outcome assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1
      year, 2 years and 3 years), which aims to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events
      after off-pump versus on-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients. Primary outcomes will be
      all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with successful
      resuscitation, low cardiac output syndrome/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary
      reintervention. Secondary outcomes will be major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events,
      operative time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamic shock, new onset of atrial
      fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperation for bleeding, pneumonia, length of stay
      in intensive care unit, length of stay in hospital, number of units of blood transfused,
      graft patency, rate of complete revascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac
      surgery, quality of life after cardiac surgery and costs.

      Discussion:

      FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior to conventional on-pump CABG
      in the surgical treatment of pre-frail and frail patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most controversial areas of cardiac surgery has been whether off-pump coronary
      artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) surgery is superior to conventional on-pump coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. There is an ongoing debate about the benefits and
      disadvantages of OPCAB. Initial trials have shown that off-pump CABG is feasible in selected
      low-risk patients and offers results similar to those of CABG performed with the conventional
      on-pump technique (on-pump CABG)[1,2]. In institutions with experience in off-pump CABG, the
      rates of major adverse events and of complete revascularization and graft patency have been
      similar to those with on-pump CABG[3].

      These positive results have been called into question by reports of inferior graft patency
      and higher rates of repeat target-vessel revascularization associated with off-pump
      CABG[4,5].

      The Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) trial[6] showed that, among low-risk patients, the rate
      of death or major adverse events at 30 days after surgery was similar with off-pump and
      on-pump CABG, but off-pump CABG was associated with a higher rate of incomplete
      revascularization at 1 year. Short-term mortality and morbidity after off-pump and on-pump
      CABG were similar in a recent trial involving 4752 patients with a mixed operative-risk
      profile (the CABG Off- or On-Pump Revascularization Study [CORONARY])[7].

      The German Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Elderly Patients (GOPCABE)[8] study
      focused exclusively on patients 75 years of age or older. However, this trial would not
      elucidate the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in high-risk patients because this specific
      group of German patients were moderate risk patients.

      The results of the Best Bypass Surgery (BBS) trial[9], performed on 341 high-risk patients
      (European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation &quot;EuroSCORE&quot;&gt;5) undergoing on-pump CABG
      or off-pump CABG, reported no significant differences in the composite of adverse cardiac and
      cerebrovascular events or in any of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, acute
      myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, low cardiac output/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and
      coronary reintervention.

      However, in our opinion, the definition of high-risk patient should be interpreted carefully,
      since the EuroSCORE identifies patients based on 18 independent variables, many of which were
      not considered in the study. Risk factors such as previous cardiac surgery, critical
      preoperative state, emergency operation, and poor left ventricular dysfunction were excluded.
      Furthermore, active endocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, other than isolated CABG, surgery
      on the thoracic aorta, and postinfarction septal rupture were not considered due to the
      nature of the study. Chronic pulmonary disease and neurological dysfunction were not defined
      according to EuroSCORE, and there is no information on patients with unstable angina. In the
      real world, with more than 1500 patients, we showed lower mortality among patients who
      underwent off-pump CABG[10]. So, after a certain cut-off EuroSCORE &gt; 4.5 or 2000
      Bernstein-Parsonnet score &gt;17.75, off-pump CABG significantly reduces death rates. Indeed,
      numerous large retrospective studies and meta-analyses have shown significant short-term
      improvements after OPCAB and comparable long-term outcomes. A recent risk-adjusted analysis
      of the national Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database assessing 876,081 patients
      demonstrated a significant reduction in death and stroke (11% and 34% reduction,
      respectively) after OPCAB, seen in both low- and high-volume centers[11]. After that, it is
      important to reconsider the best approach for patients with higher surgical risk for CABG.

      Clearly, a base is being built with strong scientific evidence that this is the group that
      experiences the most benefit from off-pump CABG. This evidence allows not using
      cardiopulmonary bypass to be the main surgical approach, and complete revascularization and
      greater use of arterial grafts in patients with high surgical risk as the second plan[12].

      Actually, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate a significant
      mortality benefit for OPCAB[13]. However, the available RCTs were underpowered to detect
      significant differences between the groups and suffered from high selection and exclusion
      biases. Even more important is the fact that the available RCTs so far have primarily focused
      only on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but
      not on frail patients in whom the benefits of OPCAB should be well defined. Moreover, the
      conversion rates (12.4% in ROOBY, 7.9% in CORONARY, and 5% in GOPCABE) may suggest that some
      of the participating surgeons were inexperienced because expert centers report conversion
      rates between 2% and 4%[14], which significantly affects long-term outcomes.

      We believe that avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass should be viewed primarily as a step toward
      avoiding aortic manipulation. Despite the long-term benefits of surgery, some patients may
      choose percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of complex multivessel disease to
      avoid the morbidity associated with CABG, of which stroke is the most feared. Expert OPCAB
      surgeons can offer equivalent durability of graft patency as in CABG, with a lower rate of
      stroke if aortic manipulation is avoided. Authors make mistakes in pointing out that on-pump
      CABG should be able to be performed under all circumstances, on all patients, at all
      institutions, regardless of their cardiac volume[14]. Thus, for example, owing to this rather
      conflicting evidence, either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG surgery could
      be offered to patients with chronic kidney disease, depending on the complexity of coronary
      disease and comorbidities. If PCI is recommended, appropriate measures should be employed to
      prevent contrast-induced worsening of renal function. If CABG surgery is the preferred
      revascularization strategy, the off-pump technique might reduce the risk of acute kidney
      injury[15].

      On the other hand, cardiac scores, including EuroSCORE and STS, have been developed to
      predict the risk of adverse outcomes following surgery. Frailty, an independent predictor of
      mortality and complications, is not included in these risk algorithms. Emerging evidence
      suggests that frailty is a better marker of biological age and more important than
      chronological age[16,17]. Afilalo et al.[18] determined that patients with slow preoperative
      gait speed (≥6 s to walk 5 m) had a 2 to 3 fold increased risk of mortality and major
      morbidity for any given level of STS-Predicted Risk of Mortality or Major Morbidity (PROM)
      compared with normal speed. Gait speed added to STS-PROM marginally increased model
      performance from 0.70 (0.60-0.80) to 0.74 (0.64-0.84). Forty-three percent of patients died
      or sustained a major complication assessed as high STS-PROM risk (≥15%) together with slow
      gait speed, compared with 21.7% low STS risk with slow gait and 18.9% high STS risk with
      normal gait. Afilalo et al.[19] subsequently evaluated the prognostic value of various
      frailty, disability and cardiac risk scores to identify the optimal combination to predict
      adverse outcome. Patients with slow gait speed and ≥3 impairments on the Nagi disability
      scale predicted in-hospital morbidity and mortality above that of the Parsonnet cardiac risk
      score (AUC 0.76 vs. 0.72 with Parsonnet score alone). Lee et al.[20] performed a
      retrospective review of a large cardiac registry, comparing outcomes between non-frail and
      frail individuals (coded as having deficiencies in the activities of daily living, need for
      walking aids or diagnosis of dementia). Frailty was an independent risk factor for
      in-hospital mortality (risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.1-3.0; P=0.03) and mortality at 2 years (risk-adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 1.5, 95% CI
      1.1-2.2; P=0.01).The benefits of CABG without cardiopulmonary bypass in pre-frail and frail
      patients are still undetermined. In conclusion, frailty is defined as a geriatric syndrome of
      impaired resiliency to stressors (such as cardiac surgery) that has been delineated recently
      in the cardiovascular literature. However, the benefits of CABG without cardiopulmonary
      bypass in these patients are still undetermined. We believe OPCAB remains an important
      technique for the improvement of coronary surgery. The biggest question right now is whether
      pre-frail and frail patients will benefit more from off-pump or on-pump CABG.

      The aim of this paper was to describe the FRAGILE trial protocol which intends to clarify the
      potential benefit of off-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients; we will conduct a
      multicenter prospective RCT comparing off-pump versus on-pump CABG in frail patients.
