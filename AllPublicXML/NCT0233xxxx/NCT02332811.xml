      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the reduction in serum phosphorus from baseline to end of study with Sevelamer
      carbonate tablets 800 mg and Sevelamer carbonate Powder 2.4 g in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      patients both on haemodialysis and not on dialysis

      Secondary Objective:

      Evaluate the safety on the basis of adverse events, changes in laboratory values and vital
      signs from baseline (Day 0) to Day 56 (End of treatment/ End of Study)

          -  Have the following laboratory measurement:

               -  iPTH â‰¤ 1000 pg/mL at screening (including results obtained within 60 days prior
                  to screening)

               -  If not taking a phosphate binder, a serum phosphorus measurement &gt;5.5 mg/dL (1.78
