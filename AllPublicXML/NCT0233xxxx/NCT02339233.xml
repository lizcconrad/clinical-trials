  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to assess whether task specific locomotor training and spinal cord
      electrical stimulation (SCES) can induce neural reorganization of the functionally isolated
      human spinal cord to improve standing and stepping in individuals with functionally complete
      SCI. The investigators propose that locomotor training will result in generation of more
      effective standing and stepping efferent patterns by restoring phase dependent modulation of
      reflexes and reciprocal inhibition, reducing clonus and mediating interlimb coordination. The
      investigators propose that the SCES will optimize the physiological state of the spinal cord
      interneuronal circuitry compromised by compensating for loss of supraspinal input for the
      retraining of these tasks.

      Participants will be screened for eligibility and then participate in pre-training motor,
      bladder and cardiovascular experiments, followed by 80 sessions of locomotor training.
      Participants will repeat experiments after the 80 training sessions to quantify that no motor
      pattern changes are achievable with locomotor training alone and will be evaluated for
      appropriate candidacy for surgery and epidural stimulation. Participants will be surgically
      implanted with an epidural stimulator and experiments will be conducted with and without
      stimulation. Investigators will identify appropriate stimulation parameters for inducing
      stepping and standing in combination with manual assistance using body weight support on a
      treadmill and/or overground. Participants will undergo 80-200 training sessions of locomotor
      training with epidural stimulation. Experiments will be repeated mid and post-training
      interventions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All research participants, irrespective of age or sex, will meet the following
             criteria:

               1. stable medical condition without cardiopulmonary disease or dysautonomia that
                  would contraindicate standing or stepping with BWST;

               2. no painful musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, contracture, pressure
                  sore, or urinary tract infection that might interfere with stand or step
                  training;

               3. no clinically significant depression or ongoing drug abuse;

               4. no current anti-spasticity medication regimen;

               5. non-progressive SCI above T10;

               6. must not have received botox injections in the prior six months;

               7. be unable to stand or step independently;

               8. at least one-year post injury; and

               9. must be at least 18 years of age.

        In addition, all subjects must satisfy each of the three conditions of the functional
        neurophysiological assessment described below.

        Functional Neurophysiological Assessment (FNPA). We will use FNPA to screen potential
        research participants based on specific neurophysiological inclusion criteria. Participants
        must have no volitional control of movement below the level of the lesion, but must retain
        some brain influence on spinal reflexes. Our target population, which will be identified by
        FNPA, cannot be identified reliable using traditional assessments: hence individual
        subjects may be classified widely as Class A, B, or C on the ASIA SCI scale. We will
        include only subjects who fulfill the following three requirements:

          1. There is no descending volitional control of movement below the lesion

          2. Segmental reflexes remain functional below the lesion

          3. Brain influence on spinal reflexes is retained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ventilatory dependent

          2. painful musculoskeletal function, unhealed fracture, contracture, or pressure sore
             that might interfere with training;

          3. clinically significant depression or ongoing drug abuse;

          4. cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder or renal disease unrelated to SCI;

          5. severe anemia (Hgb&lt;8 g/dL) or hypovolemia; and

          6. HIV or AIDS related illness.
