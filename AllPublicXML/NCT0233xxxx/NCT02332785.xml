  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study, the investigators plan to review the clinical, epidemiology, pathology, and
      endoscopic features of colon serrated lesions as well as outcome of endoscopic resection of
      these lesions. The findings will help us define the natural history of colon serrated
      lesions, develop techniques for endoscopic management of patients with serrated lesions, and
      identity areas for improvement. The data will be used for continuing quality improvement and
      presenting our outcomes at academic meetings and publishing our results in peer reviewed
      journals.

      Our goal is to collect data from our endoscopy reports and electronic medical record system
      to complete a descriptive analysis of the demographics, colonoscopy resection procedure, and
      outcome of resection - immediate and delayed complications, tumor recurrence, and cancer
      during follow-up 010/01/2014 - 12/31/2025.

      Specific variable to be reviewed:

        1. Patient Demographics: Age, Sex, Race, Height, Weight, BMI (patient privacy will be
           acknowledged).

        2. Indications for Colonoscopy (screening, surveillance, symptoms or tertiary referral
           [EMR]).

        3. Comorbid conditions: cancer and surgical history, medical conditions.

        4. Colonoscopy procedure: Quality of colon preparation (using the Boston Bowel Preparation
           Scale) 0 - 3 for each section of the colon (Ascending, Transverse, Descending and Total
           Colon), cecal intubation rate, cecal intubation and total procedure time, type of
           colonoscope (if CO2 was used in the procedure and techniques for colonoscope insertion,
           including position changes.

        5. Examination findings: Number of polyps and nature of polyps removed (site, size,
           surface, vascular pattern); type of polyp removed (serrated and sessile (flat); optical
           features and histology of polyps.

        6. Resection techniques: Biopsy, snare resection, endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic
           submucosal dissection etc.

        7. Including Pathology report findings so that a comparison can be made of the optical
           features and actual pathology report.

        8. Outcomes of colonoscopy: Complete or incomplete resection, local recurrence, need for
           surgery, etc.

        9. Outcome of colonoscopy: Complications (Bleeding and perforation).
