  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this intervention study is to test the effect of diet on improvement in
      cognitive performanc in kindergarden children aged 4-6 years. Children will be randomly
      allocated into two groups, one consuming prepared meals with herring or mackerel for four
      months, and one group consuming meals containing meat as a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive effects of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as provided by fatty
      fish intake, on cognitive functions are widely accepted, but so far there is no clear
      evidence from randomized intervention studies in children and young adults, although fish
      intake has been positively associated with cognitive functions in observational studies. The
      main aim of this study is to test the effect of diet on improvement in cognitive performance
      in kindergarden children aged 4-6 years. In the intervention study, children will be randomly
      allocated into two groups, one consuming prepared meals with herring or mackerel for four
      months, and one group consuming meals containing meat as a control group. The children
      (n=200) will consume the prepared meals three times a week. Cognitive performance of the
      children will be tested at study start and end using the the Wechsler Preschool and Primary
      Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI_III) and nine hole peg test. Children will be screened for
      mental health problems in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which is a
      global measure of children's mental health. Compliance will be monitored by documentation of
      study fish intake and measuring fatty acid status. For a more detailed investigation of
      effects of increased herring and mackerel intake, before and after intervention blood and
      urine will be collected for lipidomic analysis (metabolites), vitamin D and iodine
      determination and genotyping (fatty acid metabolism and inflammation).
