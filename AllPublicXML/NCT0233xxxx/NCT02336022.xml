  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric postoperative patients are at increased risk for post-operative respiratory
      complications such as hypoventilation. There is no objective measure of early respiratory
      parameters that would predict respiratory compromise after surgery efficiently in pediatric
      patients. Current respiratory assessment in non-intubated patients relies on oximetry data,
      impendence respiratory rate monitor and subjective clinical assessment. Pulse oximetry has
      been extremely helpful in recognizing oxygen desaturations but it is a late indicator of
      respiratory decline. New advances in technology and digital signal processing have led to the
      development of an improved impedance based Respiratory Volume Monitor (RVM). The RVM
      (ExSpiron™, Respiratory Motion, Inc.; Waltham, MA) has been shown to provide accurate
      real-time, continuous, non-invasive measurements of tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation
      (MV) and respiratory rate (RR) mostly in adult patients. The investigators' primary
      hypothesis is that the non-invasive, impedance-based RVM monitor will accurately reflect TV,
      RR and MV in pediatric patients.
