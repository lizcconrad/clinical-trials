      This study evaluates the Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the treatment of
      Acute on Chronic Liver Failure in adult. Half participants will receive G-CSF and standard
      treatment in combination, while half participants will receive standard treatment.

    <textblock>
      Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can be used to mobilize stem cells to the
      periphery and the liver tissue in patients with advanced liver disease, and could promote
      hepatic regeneration. Moreover, G-CSF was reported to protect patients from sepsis by
      restoring the function of both neutrophils and monocytes. Therefore, G-CSF therapy may be
      beneficial for liver regeneration in patients with ACLF induced by different causes.

      standard therapy for the treatment of ACLF includes reduced glutathione, glycyrrhizin,
      ademetionine,polyene phosphatidylcholine, alprostadil, and human serum albumin) on the day of
      admission. HBV associated ACLF patients receive entecavir at the same time
