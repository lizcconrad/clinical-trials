    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safeness and effectiveness of mix vaccine (MV).
      Enrolled patients will receive standard treatment according to National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) guide line with or without combining MV injection. The efficacy and side
      effect will be compared between the two groups.

      In the study, after evaluation of the general and physical status, eligible patients will be
      enrolled and randomly assigned into two arms at an 1:1 ratio. In the control arm patients
      will be receiving standard therapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
      guide line (control group) and in experimental arm, patients will be receiving simultaneous
      standard therapy and injection of mix vaccine (MV). MV will be injected weekly till disease
      progression.

      Blood sample will be obtained at baseline and every week before MV injection for the
      assessment of clinical hematology, biochemistry measurements and immunology index (including
      immunoglobin, interleukin and interferon). Patients will be evaluated for toxicity throughout
      the study. Side effect, progression free survival, immunology index and general status will
      be recorded.

    <description>MV is an intravenous intralipid suspension with 5 various vaccines, including DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus ), BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine), measles, Serratia and pneumococcus. Inject 0.5 ml of the mixture subcutaneously every week. Best reaction after injection was defined as showing regional red and swollen at the injection point and mild fever and to achieve this, dose increasing or reduction is acceptable.</description>

    <description>Patient will receive a comprehensive histological and imaging check up to evaluate the histological type, stage of the disease and performance status. Then the patient will receive standard treatment, in brief, surgical resection for early stage patients and systemic treatment including chemotherapy for advanced stage patients, according to NCCN guide line.</description>
