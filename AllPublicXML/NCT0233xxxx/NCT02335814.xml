               -  Cohort B: Subjects with a FLT3 mutation (e.g. ITD or D835) without prior FLT3
                  inhibitor treatment

          7. The interval from prior treatment to time of initiation of FLX925 administration will
             be ≥ 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents and ≥ 5 half-lives for investigational/non-cytotoxic
             agents. For patients with rapidly proliferative disease, use of hydroxyurea is allowed
             if started prior to initiation of study therapy;

          8. Clinically significant toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy (except

             parameters [Grade 1 to 4 permitted]);

          9. Serum AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN;

         10. Serum bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN unless due to Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis or considered
             to be related to leukemia;

         11. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 60 mL/hour
             by the Cockroft-Gault equation;
