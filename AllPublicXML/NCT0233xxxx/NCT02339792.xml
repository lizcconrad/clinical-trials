  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled pragmatic study is aimed to set-up, assess and implement an
      integrated e-learning program of medical education in an hospital setting, focused on
      teaching and implementing CGA added to geriatric pharmacological notions (GPNs) to improve
      the quality of drug prescribing in elderly patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The integrated e-learning program (intervention group) is focused on teaching and
      implementing knowledge on CGA and GPNs to help clinicians to improve the quality of drug
      prescribing in the elderly.The GPNs is focused on pharmaco-epidemiological issues of drug
      prescribing, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes during aging, topics in evaluating
      and managing polypharmacy, criteria to review the appropriateness of drug therapies and the
      clinical relevance of PDDI in the elderly. The control group receives only GPNs.

    <description>The primary study objective is to evaluate whether an integrated e-learning program of medical education, focused on teaching and implementing CGA added to GPNs (intervention) is superior to delivering GPNs only (control) in reducing the prescription of potentially inappropriate medications (PID) or of potential drug-drug interactions (PDDI) during hospitalization and at hospital discharge in hospitalized elderly.
The primary outcome is the change in prescription of PID,as defined by Beers' criteria , or of PDDI related to the 20 drugs most frequently prescribed during hospital stay and at discharge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>clinical outcomes (lenght of hospitalization, mortality, rehospitalization)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objectives are the assessment of:
- the impact of the integrated e-learning intervention in terms of length of hospitalization, in-hospital and overall mortality, re-hospitalization and institutionalization during a follow-up of 12 months; - the persistence and the clinical impact on the enrolled patients of the effect of the integrated e-learning intervention on the improvement of quality of drug prescribing during a follow-up of 12 months.
Secondary outcomes are the persistence and the clinical impact of the integrated e-learning intervention on duration of hospitalization, rate of in-hospital and overall mortality, re-hospitalization and institutionalization during 12 months of follow-up.</description>
