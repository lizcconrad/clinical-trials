      The purpose of this study is to evaluate subjects with X-linked retinoschisis in a clinical
      setting to collect data on disease progression.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate subjects with XLRS in a clinical setting and gather
      data on disease progression. The data from this study will enhance the understanding of the
      natural history of this rare disease and will facilitate appropriately powered safety studies
      in a future gene therapy trial in humans.

    <description>All subjects enrolled in this study will be seen every 6 months following the screening visit. During the 3 main study visits, a series of tests will be performed to assess visual function. Some of these tests are part of routine care that patients would receive on an annual basis regardless of study participation. Other tests are being performed to determine if they are effective at monitoring disease progression in this population. For each of the 3 main study visits, testing may be spread over multiple days to ensure completion of all tests.</description>

    <description>Subjects with maculoschisis may be offered topical treatment with CAIs. These subjects will be asked to visit the study site at 1 month and 3 months after starting topical treatment. During these additional visits, subjects will undergo a dilated eye exam, BCVA, and SD-OCT imaging to assess efficacy of treatment (i.e. reduction of maculoschisis).</description>

          -  angle-closure glaucoma

          -  concomitant use of oral carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors

          -  conjunctivitis and lid reactions reported with chronic administration

          -  moderate to severe renal (CrCl less than 30 mL/min) or hepatic insufficiency

          -  ocular infection or inflammation

          -  recent ocular surgery

        Topical Eye Drop Brinzolamide

        Contraindications:

        • hypersensitivity to any component of the product, including sulfa allergies

        Precautions:

          -  concomitant use of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended

          -  contact lens use; remove contact lenses prior to administration, allow 15 minutes
             before reinsertion

          -  hypersensitivity to sulfonamides; severe reaction may occur; discontinue if signs or
             symptoms appear

          -  low corneal endothelial cell counts; increased risk of corneal edema

          -  renal impairment, severe (CrCl less than 30 mL/min); use not recommended
