    <description>Patients will receive 38 fractions of radiation, each fraction size will be 2Gy. The total dose will be 78Gy to PTV 1. Whereas the total dose will be 70Gy over 38 fractions to PTV 2. The treatment will be delivered 5 fractions per week consecutively except public holiday, and the total duration of treatment will be 7.5 to 8 weeks.</description>

Whereas the total dose will be 32.5Gy over 5 fractions to PTV2. The 5 treatments will be scheduled to be delivered twice aweek over approximately 15-17 days. A minimum of 72 hours and a maximum of 96 hoursshould separate each treatment. No more than 2 fractions will be delivered per week. The total duration of treatment will be no shorter than 15 days and no longer than 17 days.</description>
