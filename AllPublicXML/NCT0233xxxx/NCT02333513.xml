      This trial is aimed at evaluating the safety and effectiveness of PCV chemotherapy in
      patients with recurrent high-grade glioma with IDH1/2 mutation. And, this trial is approved
      by medical ethics committee of hebei yanda hospital. Also, the trial has got a registry code
      &quot;ChiCTR-OOC-15005759&quot; in China clinical trial registry. Researchers will conduct thsi trial
      from 2015/02 to 2017/12, and 100 recurrent high-grade glioma with IDH1/2 mutation patients
      will be recruited. Patients who are recruited will get PCV chemotherapy in ether Hebei Yanda
      Hospital or Beijing Tiantan hospital, and get follow-ups from clinicians.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             recurrency of the disease is ongoing.

          -  The report of the pathological diagnosis contained the status of IDH gene, and showed
             that IDH1/2 mutation existed.

          -  The age of the patient is between 18 years old and 70 years old.

          -  The condition of the patient permits the procedure of chemotherapy using PCV schema.
