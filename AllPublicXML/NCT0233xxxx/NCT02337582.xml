  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled trial was performed in Bogotá, Colombia between 2007-2008 to
      evaluate the effects of an opportunistic (hospital-based) screening program (intervention)
      vs. usual care (control) in which 26 clinics were randomized to an intervention (N=13) or
      control arm (N=13). At intervention clinics general practitioners were instructed to perform
      clinical breast examination (CBE) on all women aged 50-69 years attending clinics for
      non-breast health related issues, and to refer them for mammographic screening. Physicians
      from control clinics were not specifically instructed to perform breast-screening or refer
      women for mammography, but could do so if they thought it appropriate ('usual care'). Women
      were followed for 2 years post-randomization.
