  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of an eight-week dietary supplementation
      with essential amino acids plus arginine on liver and plasma lipid content, whole-body fat
      oxidation, whole-body insulin sensitivity, whole body protein metabolism, and body
      composition in obese pre-pubertal children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to thirty-two obese pre-pubertal children will be recruited for this study. Up to sixteen
      will be boys and up to sixteen will be girls. The study will be a double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial using a randomized, but counter-balanced design. This will ensure
      equal numbers in the two groups that the children are randomized to, for each sex. The
      control group will receive placebo and the intervention group will receive essential amino
      acids plus arginine. The supplements (essential amino acids plus arginine, and placebo) will
      be given in the form of a drink twice a day for a total of 8 weeks. Both the participants and
      the investigators will be blinded to group assignment.

      The primary endpoints of this study are to assess the effect of essential amino acids (EAA)
      plus arginine supplementation on lipid and protein metabolism. For this, liver lipid content,
      hepatic apoptosis, plasma lipids, apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) levels, hepatic fatty
      oxidation, whole body insulin sensitivity, body composition and whole body protein turnover.
      will be compared between the intervention and placebo groups.
