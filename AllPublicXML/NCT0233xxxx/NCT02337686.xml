  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Keytruda (pembrolizumab) can help to
      control glioblastoma. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of some types of melanoma. Its use against brain tumors in this study is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive pembrolizumab by
      vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 21 of each 42-day study cycle.

      On Day 22 of Cycle 1, you will be having surgery as part of routine care. After recovering
      from surgery (which may take around 14-21 days), you will start receiving pembrolizumab on
      Day 1 of Cycle 2.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check how well your
           blood clots, and to check your thyroid function. This blood draw will also include a
           pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 22 of Cycle 1, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. You will sign a separate
      consent form that describes the procedure and risks. In addition to the surgery:

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  Leftover tumor tissue from surgery will be collected and used for biomarker testing.

      As early as possible after surgery, you will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of
      the disease. The study staff will let you know when this can be done.

      On Days 1 and 21 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3, 6, and 9, blood (about 7 tablespoons) will also be drawn for biomarker
      testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond, you will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the
      disease.

      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed or the tests above may be repeated
      if the study doctor thinks it is needed. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra
      tests.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue receiving pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after your last study drug dose, you will visit the clinic. At this visit::

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If you stop the study drug because of intolerable side effects, every 8 weeks after your last
      study drug dose, you will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.

      If the disease gets worse, blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months after the end-of-treatment visit, the study staff will call and ask how you
      are feeling and ask about any new cancer treatments you may be receiving. These calls should
      take about 5-10 minutes each time.

          3. Have histologically confirmed World Health Organization Grade IV malignant glioma
             (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma). Participants will be eligible if the original histology
             was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or
             variants is made.

          4. Patients must be at first or second relapse and clinically require reoperation for

             If the participant had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor
             therapy instituted for up to 12 weeks, this is considered one relapse. For
             participants who had prior therapy for a low grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a
             high grade glioma will be considered first relapse.

          5. Have measurable disease consisting of a minimal volume of 1 cm3.

          6. Have provided tissue from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or
             excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.

          7. Have a performance status of &gt;/= 60 on the KPS.

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.
