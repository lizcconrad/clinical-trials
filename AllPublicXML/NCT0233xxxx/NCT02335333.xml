      The primary purpose of this study is to measure the correlation between baseline expression
      of aging biomarkers, SenesceTest in blood of organ donor and renal graft function. This pilot
      study will study patients who are undergoing renal transplantation with organs from extended
      criteria donors, standard criteria donors or donation after cardiac death and compare ability
      of SenesceTest to predict renal graft function immediately after the transplant and at 1 year
      followup.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, donated organs are ranked amongst each other based on a formula for Kidney Donor
      Patient Index (KDPI; a variation of Donor Risk index) 8 which includes donor demographics and
      clinical history but no molecular markers of kidney function other than serum creatinine.
      Using KDPI assessment, nearly all ECD kidneys fall into the high-risk category. And while ECD
      kidneys are associated with higher risk of graft failure, studies note a wide variability in
      ECD organ quality and the associated graft survival (half-life graft survival 4.5-7.9 years),
      suggesting that current models of assessing organ quality are inadequate. Furthermore, prior
      to even being assigned a KDPI, over 37% of all kidneys and over 50% of ECD kidneys are
      discarded based on biopsy findings. However, recent studies called into question the reliance
      on procurement kidney biopsy reports in making acceptance decisions by demonstrating
      significant overlap in the biopsy findings between discarded and transplanted kidneys. The
      use of ECD kidneys is becoming more widespread and, according to a recent report, 70% adults
      &gt;65yo and 50% adults between 50 and 64 yo are willing to accept an ECD kidney. Therefore, new
      methodology for assessment of graft viability would increase transplantation rates
      particularly for organs from older or expanded criteria donors, shorten patient's time on
      wait list (currently 45 months average 50) and improve their outcomes by taking them off
      dialysis sooner.

      Here, we propose a new approachâ€”using molecular age markers (collectively referred to as
      SenesceTest) to predict kidney graft function.
