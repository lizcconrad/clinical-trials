      The main goals of this study are to provide a cognitive, neurological, brain morphological,
      and serological profile of sepsis survivors in order to make long-term prognosis of recovery
      and estimate the need for rehabilitation measures in order to help patients reintegrate into
      normal daily life.

      Comparison of cognitive function in severe septic/septic shock ICU patients with non-septic
      postoperative ICU patients and actively recruited healthy controls at several time points up
      to 12 months after leaving the ICU.

      Secondary aims:

        -  Profiling specific cognitive deficits in sepsis survivors over time.

        -  Identifying possible subclasses of long-term cognitive impairment according to facets of
           disease, therapy and ICU experience.

        -  Investigating long-term brain morphological changes, with hippocampus as region of
           interest (ROI).

        -  Determining values of Serum- and CSF-Biomarkers

        -  Evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic value of non-routine biomarkers for systemic-
           and neuroinflammation in the acute phase and in the long-term

        -  Investigate associations between brain morphological changes, cognitive changes,
           neurological status, psychiatric burden, disability level, employment status and
           health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

        -  Investigating brain-activity changes in resting state electro-encephalogram (EEG)

The protocol includes 5 phases, each one minute long: 1) eyes open, relaxed state, fixation of a black dot at 2 m distance, 2) word generation using letter &quot;P&quot; with eyes closed, 3) mental arithmetic: continuous subtraction of 7 starting from 1,000 with eyes closed, 4) eyes closed, relaxed state, no task, 5) visualization of a previously memorized geometric figure with eyes closed. Data sampled at a rate of 256 Herz using an anti-aliasing low pass filter. Power spectra will be calculated for consecutive 4-second windows and calculated for each electrode contact. Absolute spectral power will be determined for the delta (0.5-4 Herz), theta (4-8 Herz), alpha (8-13 Herz), beta (13-20 Herz) and gamma (20-40 Herz) bands, which will be averaged across all windows.</description>
