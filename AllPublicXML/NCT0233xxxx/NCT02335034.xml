      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the improvement of patients with gonarthritis exposed to a
      multidisciplinary care program with and without associated classroom educational program.
      METHODS: 152 patients (men and women) aged 40 or older with arthritis stages I to III of
      Kelgren and Lawrence. Have been treated with drugs, orthotics and referred to physical
      rehabilitation (physiotherapy and/or physical activity). Patients will be randomized into 2
      groups of 76 and will go through pre-assessment with multidisciplinary team: Psychologist -
      assess cognitive ability; level of anxiety, and depression. Nutritionist - anthropometric
      parameters and diet quality. Social Worker - Level of education, religion, autonomy and
      mobility capacity to the hospital. Physiotherapist - range of motion, pain, function and
      quality of life. Occupational Therapy - range of motion and strength. Physical Educator -
      level of physical activity and functional capacity. Orthopaedic - additional examinations,
      disease classification, orthotics, report to Social Security and Traffic Department,
      evaluation questionnaires (SF 36, VAS, WOMAC, LEQUESNE), referral to physical therapy,
      physical activity and inform consent. A group will submitted to two interventions, with an
      interval of two months between each intervention. The control group will only make
      evaluations / consultations with all professional teams without classes for 2 years, then
      will attend the courses and will be followed by two more years. Interventions will be
      lectures and practices with the seven professional teams, covering the topic arthritis
      (orthopedic team), what is disease, being ill, and the role of the patient in the treatment
      (psychology) to obtain behavioral change. Lectures and practices with physical therapy and
      occupational therapy to show the importance of exercise in relieving symptoms (physical
      therapy), the importance of rest and proper ergonomics at home and at work (occupational
      therapy). The nutritionist shows proper alimentation. Lecture and practice with physical
      educator (showing the difference between the laber work and regular physical activity as well
      as the importance of strength exercises, resistance and stretching) and theoretical class
      with the social service by calling attention to the importance of leisure. After two months,
      the second intervention is made in order to verify the acquired concepts. Six months, 1, 2, 3
      and 4 years after the first evaluation, the groups will be called to new multi evaluation.
