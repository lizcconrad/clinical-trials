  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial wherein subjects with breast cancer will be
      randomized to receive either 20 mg oral melatonin or placebo the night before their first RT,
      nightly throughout their RT, and for an additional 2 weeks following the completion of their
      RT. After informed consent is obtained from eligible subjects, they will then be
      electronically randomized on a 1:1 ratio to melatonin treatment or placebo. The subjects will
      be stratified according to treatment duration (less than 3 weeks; equal to or greater than 3
      weeks) and prior chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either melatonin or placebo. Subjects will receive
      20-mg oral melatonin or placebo the night before their first RT treatment, each night
      throughout the course of RT treatment, and for 2 weeks following the completion of RT.
      Patients with localized breast cancer will receive standard-of-care RT as determined by the
      treating physician. The RT regimens include: (1) 1 week of APBI; (2) 3-4 weeks of an
      accelerated hypofractionation RT schedule; and (3) 6-8 weeks of a standard RT schedule. No
      additional concomitant medication or supportive care guidelines are required for this study.
      Subjects will receive daily melatonin or placebo beginning the night before their course of
      RT and for an additional 2-week period that extends beyond the conclusion of their RT.
      Subjects will be given a Study Diary to record their use of study medication. Patients will
      be followed for 60 days after removal from the study treatment or until death, whichever
      occurs first. Patients removed from the study treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
