  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a complete spinal cord injury (SCI), the patient becomes wheelchair-dependent, and the
      associated lack of weight-bearing and inactivity of paralysed muscles can lead to extensive
      bone loss in the long bones of the legs. It has been documented that the most rapid phase of
      bone loss is during the first year, but bone loss can continue for a number of years
      post-injury, leading to an increased risk of fracture in chronic SCI. Through a previous
      longitudinal study, in which we described rates of bone loss in the first year of SCI using
      peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT), we showed that there is a subset of
      patients who suffer from extremely rapid bone loss, losing up to 50% of their bone mineral
      density (BMD) in the first 12 months post-SCI. As a result of this work, we now know that, by
      performing repeat bone scans within months of injury, we are able to detect and &quot;red-flag&quot;
      those patients at highest risk of rapidly weakening bones. We propose that, once these
      patients have been identified, there is an opportunity to intervene with bone-stimulating
      interventions within months of injury, before BMD reaches dangerously low values. In this new
      phase of the research, therefore, we are introducing an intervention phase to the
      longitudinal pQCT study. For this, we aim to trial a physical intervention, Whole Body
      Vibration (WBV), that could potentially reduce rates of further bone loss in fast bone
      losers. Vibration would achieve this by acting as a mechanical stimulus for bone cells, to
      encourage bone formation. If shown to be successful as an early bone-stimulating
      intervention, it may prove to be a tool for reducing future fracture risk in patients with
      SCI.
