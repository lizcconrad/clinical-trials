  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study using pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) for first-line treatment of
      participants with advanced/unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic urothelial cancer who are
      ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. The primary study objective is to determine the
      objective response rate (ORR) in all participants, in participants whose tumors rely on
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein (PD-L1-positive tumors), and in participants
      with strongly PD-L1-positive tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receiving pembrolizumab who attain a complete response (CR) may consider
      stopping trial treatment if they meet criteria for holding therapy. Participants who stop
      trial treatment after receiving 24 months of trial treatment for reasons other than
      progressive disease (PD) or intolerability, or participants who attain a CR and stop trial
      treatment may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment upon experiencing PD.
