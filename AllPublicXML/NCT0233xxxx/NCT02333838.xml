  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic cord blood stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative therapy for
      patients with haematological malignancies. We have extensive experience with the use of Cord
      Blood Transplantation (CBT) in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies. In adults
      however, the 40% Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM) rate observed after CBT conditioned with a
      myeloablative conditioning has encouraged the development of CBT with Reduced Intensity
      Conditioning (RIC). Our previous national CBT protocol (the Minicord French protocol -
      NCT00797758) showed that RIC CBT can reduce NRM, but relapse remains the main post-transplant
      event (&gt;30% at one year). Thus, the development of reduced toxicity rather than RIC
      conditioning for CBT is warranted in order to improve the outcome of such transplants by
      limiting NRM and reducing relapse rate. The Fludarabine, ATG and intensified doses of IV
      Busulfan (9.6 mg/Kg total dose) regimen is a well-established preparative regimen for
      reduced-intensity/toxicity conditioning prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation using
      peripheral blood stem cells mobilized with G-CSF (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
      NCT00841724). However, such regimen is likely not sufficient to allow for CB cell
      engraftment. Thiotepa is an alkylating and radio-mimetic agent with a large anti-tumor
      activity including leukemic cells, the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and to
      improve engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells. This drug has been combined to usual
      conditioning regimen without increasing the toxicity but improving the engraftment rate and
      potentially reducing the relapse rate. Thus, in the context of adult CBT for high risk
      myeloid malignancies, we propose to prospectively evaluate a reduced toxicity conditioning
      based on the association of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, IV Busulfan and ATG with the objective to
      achieve acceptable NRM rates, and to allow for improved anti-leukemic control based on the
      cytotoxic component of the conditioning regimen itself, while waiting for the long term
      immune-mediated disease control (GVL effect).

In patient with co-morbidities and/or older than 60 years, conditioning could be reduced after consulting the coordinator of the study:
IV Thiotepa (5 mg/Kg/day for 2 days) (Day -6)
IV fludarabine (40 mg/m²/day for 4 days) (from Day-5 to day -2)
