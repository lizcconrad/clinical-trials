    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in pharmacological treatment, the global burden of depression is
      increasing worldwide. The major challenge in antidepressant treatment is the clinicians'
      inability to predict the variability in individual response to the treatment. The development
      of biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes would enable clinician to find the right
      medication for a particular patient at the early stage of the treatment and thus could reduce
      prolonged suffering and ineffective protracted treatment. Brain imaging studies that examined
      brain predictors of treatment response based on group comparisons have limited value in
      classifying individuals as responders or non-responders. Machine learning classification
      techniques such as the support vector machine (SVM) method have proven useful in the
      classification of individual brain image observations into distinct groups or classes.
      However, studies that have applied the SVM method to structural and functional magnetic
      resonance scans (fMRI) involved small sample sizes and were confounded by placebo responses.
      Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials and EEG studies have shown that early
      clinical responses and brain changes at the early phase of antidepressant treatment may
      predict later clinical outcomes suggesting that neural markers measured in the early phase of
      antidepressant treatment may improve predictive accuracy. However, there is no fMRI study to
      date that has examined the predictive accuracy of data obtained in early phase of the
      treatment. We have preliminary fMRI data relating to early treatment response that form the
      basis of this proposed study.

      The main objective of this study is to use machine learning method to examine the predictive
      value (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of resting state and emotional task-related fMRI
      data collected at pre-treatment baseline (week 0) and in the early phase of antidepressant
      treatment (week 2) in the classification of remitters (&lt; 10 MADRS scores after 12 weeks of
      treatment) and non-remitters in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A secondary
      objective is to determine which data set (week 0 or week 2) gives the best predictive value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent, chronic disabling condition with
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Depression currently is the fourth leading cause of
      global burden of disease (DALYs) and disability worldwide, and is expected to be second by
      20201. Around one in eight people in Canada will develop depression during their lifetime,
      with the total cost to the Canadian economy estimated at $51 billion per year2. The costs of
      treating MDD are high in part due to limitations in effectiveness of antidepressant
      treatment. Approximately 60% of patients fail to remit to the first antidepressant
      prescribed3 and the subsequent selection of antidepressants remains a matter of trial and
      error. Using this trial and error approach, it may take a year or more to find the successful
      treatment for a patient4,5. The protracted ineffective treatment results in prolonged
      suffering, substantial morbidity, loss of productivity and an increased burden on patient's
      family. Brain-based biomarkers could assist in predicting clinical response to treatment
      intervention and in tailoring treatment for individual patients. The results of previous
      neuroimaging studies that examined brain markers of treatment response were derived from
      group averages 6,-9 and have limited predictive value at individual level. Another limitation
      of these studies is that predictors derived from the pretreatment baseline brain scans could
      be influenced by many personal (personality, childhood trauma, genotypes) and clinical
      (course, duration of illness, episodes, symptom clusters, and severity of symptoms and past
      medication exposure) characteristics which may limit the generalizability. On the other hand,
      there is growing evidence that the early clinical response within 2 weeks of antidepressant
      treatment and EEG changes in the first week of treatment can predict later outcomes.
      Furthermore, early treatment changes in brain function may provide crucial information on the
      brain's capacity to change with treatment and on the interactive effects between personal/
      clinical characteristics and pharmacological factors, which may help differential prediction
      of treatment responses to two antidepressants. Hence, examining the predictive value of
      dynamic brain changes during the first two weeks of treatment in individual patients would
      improve statistical reliability and predictive accuracy and minimize the confounding effect
      inherent to pretreatment scans.

      In this study, we propose to investigate the predictive value of resting state and task
      related fMRI data collected at the pretreatment baseline and 2 weeks after treatment to
      predict remitters and non-remitters to desvenlafaxine antidepressant treatment at week 12
      using machine learning classifier. Desvenlafaxine is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake
      inhibitor (SNRI) with proven efficacy, and safety and is easy to administer in single daily
      dose. It has limited sedative and cognitive side effects such as drowsiness, lack of
      alertness and poor attention, which may confound early brain changes with treatment. This
      study will provide brain-based predictive biomarkers that can be tested prospectively in
      clinical trials and eventually in clinical practice for accuracy.

      Machine Learning Classification (Support Vector Machine): The support vector machine (SVM) is
      a computer based analytical technique designed for high dimensional biological data such as
      fMRI data and provides the best classification of individual observations into distinct
      groups 38. Diagnostic classification (depression diagnosis and healthy control) and
      classification of treatment responsiveness (responders and non-responders) have been examined
      in a clinical population with fMRI data using SVM 39-41. This technique consists of two
      phases: training phase and testing phase. During the training phase an SVM is trained to
      develop a decision function or hyperplane that separates the data into two groups according
      to a class label. In the testing phase, this decision function can be used to predict the
      class label of a new subject as being a responder or non-responder. The accuracy of
      prediction by SVM depends on its specificity (identification of true negatives) and
      sensitivity (identification of true positives). In recent years a few neuroimaging studies
      have employed SVM to structural and functional MRI data in order to predict the MDD patients
      who improved with treatment and who did not. Fu et al (2008) showed that applying SVM on
      emotional task-related fMRI data, 62% of patients who achieved remission (sensitivity) and
      75% of patients who did not achieve remission (specificity) following 8 weeks of fluoxetine
      treatment could be predicted. But these results were not statistically significant due to
      small sample sizes (remitters =8, non-remitters=10). Similarly, Costafreda et al (2009)
      applied SVM to pretreatment structural scans and showed prediction with a sensitivity of 88.9
      % and a specificity of 88.9% and accuracy of 88.9% in a small sample comprised of 18 patients
      40. In a recent study involving 61 MDD patients, SVM analysis of pretreatment white matter
      data predicted clinical outcome of refractory and non- refractory depression with an accuracy
      of 65.22%, sensitivity of 56.2% and specificity of 73.91% 41. Although the results of the
      later study were statistically significant, the low sensitivity and accuracy may limit its
      clinical use. Moreover, the structural imaging may not be useful to examine predictive value
      of early treatment changes in the brain function. In summary, there are no studies, to date
      that have applied SVM to functional data generated from a large sample for use in evaluating
      predictive accuracy at the individual level.

      Main objective : Using machine learning method to examine the predictive value (sensitivity,
      specificity, accuracy) of resting state and emotional task-related fMRI data collected at the
      pretreatment time (week 0) and at the early phase of antidepressant treatment (week 2) in the
      classification of remitters and non-remitters in patients with MDD after 12 weeks of
      treatment. Secondary objective: To compare the predictive value of pretreatment baseline
      brain activity (week 0) with early treatment brain activity (week 2).

      Primary hypothesis: By employing a machine learning method to pretreatment and 2 week
      post-treatment fMRI data, we hypothesize that it is possible to predict with significant
      accuracy whether an individual patient with MDD could be classified as remitter or
      non-remitter at the end of 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment.

      Secondary hypothesis (Exploratory): Based on previous EEG studies and our preliminary data of
      standard group comparisons showing early treatment response and associated brain changes, we
      hypothesize that prediction of antidepressant treatment outcome at an individual level, will
      be better using fMRI data obtained early in treatment (2 weeks) as compared with pretreatment
      fMRI data.

      Rationale: The current study is designed to evaluate the predictive value of early brain
      changes related to antidepressant treatment to classify remitters and non-remitters based on
      their clinical response at 12 weeks of treatment. Traditionally, the neuroimaging studies
      have used group comparisons of pretreatment scans for treatment outcome prediction, which has
      limited clinical value to make predictions at the individual level. Machine learning methods
      can provide prediction at the individual level, which can be prospectively used in clinical
      practice. As the meta-analysis of clinical trials indicate that early clinical response is a
      reliable predictor of later treatment outcome11,12, our study will examine brain scans at
      both pretreatment and early post-treatment (2 weeks) times.

      Experimental Design and Procedure:

      The eligible patients with MDD will enter into a single blind placebo treatment for two
      weeks. At the end of two weeks of placebo treatment, participants will be considered as
      placebo responders based on improvement in depression symptoms as measured by the MADRS scale
      ( &gt;50% decrease in MADRS scores from the baseline). The placebo responders will be excluded
      from the study. The end of two weeks of placebo treatment will be considered as week 0 for
      active treatment. The placebo non-responders who remain eligible with a score of 22 or higher
      in MADRS will receive desvenlafaxine 50mg/day for 14 days and the dosage will be increased to
      100 mg /day at day 15 if the patient does not improve by 20% reduction in MADRS scores and
      the dosage determined at day 15 will be maintained until the end of 12 weeks. The first fMRI
      session will be performed at week 0 (pretreatment baseline) and the second session will be
      performed at the end of week 2 (14 th day). The participants will be assessed clinically at
      weeks 1,2,4,6,8,10 and 12 using MADRS, 17-item Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) rating Scale46,
      Hamilton anxiety (HAM-A) rating scale47 and clinical global impression severity of illness
      scale (CGI-S) and clinical global impression-improvement scale (CGI-I) 48. HAM-A (Hamilton
      1959) will be used to rate anxiety symptoms. To evaluate the overall clinical improvement,
      CGI-S and CGI-I will be given. Quality of life measure (Q-LES-Q) 49 will be given at the
      baseline (week 0) and at week 12. Adverse effects will be recorded at each visit. MADRS
      scores at week 12 will be used to determine remitters and non-remitters. Patients who score
      less than 10 in MADRS at week 12 will be considered as remitters 50.

      fMRI Scanning Methods

      The first fMRI session will be performed at week 0 (pretreatment baseline) and the second
      session will be performed at the end of week 2. Images will be collected using a Discovery
      MR750 3T MRI system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) at the Seaman Family MRI Research
      Centre at Foothills Hospital, Calgary. Anatomical images will include a 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE
      image (TR=9.2ms; TE= minimum; flip angle=20; FOV=25.6 cm; voxel size=1mm3. Resting state will
      consist of a 5-min resting-state scan during which the participants will be asked to keep
      their eyes closed and hold still ( TR=2000ms;TE=30ms;flip angle=75 degrees; FOV=24 cm; matrix
      size =64x64, number of slices=36; slice thickness=4mm) Two additional functional MRI scans
      will also be collected while participants perform an emotional stroop task (block design)
      using the same acquisition parameters as described for the fMRI resting scan.

      Machine learning Analysis

      We will use support vector machines (SVMs), as these have been successfully applied to
      predicting treatment outcomes in MDD from fMRI data. After preprocessing, SVM as implemented
      in PROBID software package (http://www.brain.map.co.uk/probid.htm) will be used to
      investigate the accuracy of whole brain resting and task-related Blood Oxygen Level Dependent
      (BOLD) data in predicting response to antidepressant treatment. Individual brain scans will
      be treated as points located in a high dimensional space defined by BOLD response values in
      the preprocessed images. During the training phase, a linear decision boundary in this high
      dimensional space will be defined by a &quot;hyperplane&quot; that separates the individual scans
      according to a class label. SVM classifier will be trained by providing examples of the form
      &lt;X,C&gt; where X represents the fMRI data and C represents the class label (C= 1 for remitters,
      and C = -1 for non-remitters). Once the hyperplane is determined from the training data, it
      will be used to predict the class label of a test sample. A linear kernel SVM will be used to
      extract the weight sector as an image (SVM discriminating map). A &quot;leave-one-out&quot; cross
      validation method will be used to validate the classifier. This procedure involves excluding
      a single subject from each group and the classifier will be trained using the remaining
      subjects. The subject pair excluded will be used to test the ability of the classifier to
      distinguish between remitters and non-remitters. The procedure will be repeated for each
      subject pair in the sample in order to assess the overall accuracy of SVM. To establish
      whether the classification accuracy is statistically significant, we will perform permutation
      testing. This will involve repeating the classification procedure 1000 times with a random
      permutation of the training group labels and counting the number of permutations that achieve
      higher sensitivity and specificity than the one observe with the true labels. The p value
      will be calculated by dividing this number by 1000. Bonferroni correction or false discovery
      rate will be used to correct for multiple testing. This SVM analysis and permutation testing
      will be performed on the pretreatment scan and 2-week post-treatment scan separately. The
      task-related data and resting state data will be analyzed separately.

      Sample size calculation

      The sample size calculation for a classification study is based on precision we want to
      achieve for sensitivity and specificity. The precision refers to the width of the 95%
      confidence intervals associated with the estimates. To achieve the 95% confidence interval of
      plus and minus of 0.16 for 85 % sensitivity and 85% specificity, we will need a total sample
      of 40 subjects. Having a sample size of 40 should achieve statistically significant
      classification accuracy and clinically meaningful sensitivity and specificity. Accounting a
      placebo response of 30% and drop out of 10%, we need to recruit a total of 61 subjects for
      the sample of 40.
