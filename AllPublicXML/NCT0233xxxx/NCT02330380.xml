  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal observational pilot study of psoriasis patients on
      continuous standard-of-care systemic therapeutics to determine the level of change in
      established (plasma/serum) and investigative (cellular) biomarkers that are associated with
      increased risk of CVD events.

      The final endpoint of the proposed study will be a ranking of the examined biomarkers based
      upon an integrated assessment of biomarker behavior over time.

      Secondary outcomes will assess changes in coronary artery calcification scoring, PET-MRI,
      skin biopsies, and clinical improvement.

    <description>The biomarkers examined throughout the study will be assessed. And, an integrated assessment of biomarker behavior over time will be performed. Biomarkers examined will include High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), resistin, adiponectin and leptin.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Methotrexate</arm_group_label>
    <description>Methotrexate will be dosed weekly. Methotrexate is given as a single, weekly dose and is will be started at 15mg after a first week test dose of 2.5 mg to minimize side effects and achieve efficacy. Weekly dosages will be 15mg.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Ustekinumab</arm_group_label>
    <description>Ustekinumab is given as a subcutaneous injection of 45mg if the patient is &lt;100Kg or 90mg if the patient is &gt;100Kg at weeks 0, 4, 16, and every 12 weeks thereafter.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Etanercept</arm_group_label>
    <description>Etanercept will be given in the first 3 months of treatment as 50 mg twice a week (3 or 4 days apart). After 3 months, a reduced dose of 50 mg will be given once per week.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Adalimumab</arm_group_label>
    <description>Adalimumab will be given in a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every other week.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Acitretin</arm_group_label>
    <description>Acetretin will be prescribed as daily with 25mg if the patient is &lt;80Kg or 35mg if the patient is &gt;80Kg.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>UVB Excimer Laser</arm_group_label>
    <description>Dose determination will be determined by a physician per standard-of-care by performing a Sunburn Test/Minimal Erythemal Dose Test, or by visually evaluating the patient's skin type and thickness of psoriasis plaque. Initial laser dose will be 1-4X the MED depending on the thickness of the plaque. Escalation will be 25-50% increase in dose per treatment if there is no residual erythema, 25% increase per treatment if there is mild residual erythema, and 0% increase per treatment if there is moderate residual erythema. Investigators also have the option to skip a treatment, if there is above moderate erythema, or significant patient discomfort. Patients will receive treatment twice a week.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Narrowband UVB</arm_group_label>
    <description>Narrowband UVB (311nm) will be used to treat patients 3X per week with 311nm of UVB light. Uninvolved areas of skin will be covered where possible to minimize excess sun exposure. Patients will be tested for their minimal erythemal dose (MED), after which, based upon Fitzpatrick Scale skin type, a patient will typically beginning with 1-2 minutes based on skin type and gradually increased by 10-15% per treatment dose as tolerated.</description>
