  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proposed is a randomized, controlled, modified Latin square parallel design study with two
      treatment arms to examine walnut consumption effects on diet quality, body composition, and
      markers of cardiovascular risk in adults at risk for diabetes over a 6-month period. A
      modified crossover design (Latin square)27-29 will allow for both paired and unpaired
      analyses.

      Specific Aims

        -  To determine the effects of a walnut-included diet (with or without caloric intake
           adjustment) versus walnut-excluded diet on diet quality in adults at risk for diabetes.
           Specifically, to show that a walnut-included diet, as compared to a walnut-excluded diet
           will improve overall diet quality as measured by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index in
           adults at risk for diabetes.

        -  To determine the effects of a walnut-included diet (with or without caloric intake
           adjustment) versus walnut-excluded diet on body composition in adults at risk for
           diabetes. Specifically, to show that a walnut-included diet, as compared to a
           walnut-excluded diet for 6 months will improve body fat percentage in adults at risk for
           diabetes.

        -  To assess the effects of a walnut-included diet (with or without caloric intake
           adjustment) for a 6-month period on endothelial function, lipid panel levels, fasting
           glucose level, fasting insulin level and anthropometric measures in adults at risk for
           diabetes. Specifically, to show clinically meaningful improvement in endothelial
           function, lipid panel, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), anthropometric
           measures and endothelial function with inclusion of walnuts in the diet in adults at
           risk for diabetes.

      Hypotheses

        -  A walnut-included diet with or without dietary counseling to adjust caloric intake will
           improve diet quality in adults at risk for diabetes.

        -  A walnut-included diet for 6 months with or without dietary counseling to adjust caloric
           intake will improve body composition in adults at risk for diabetes.

        -  A walnut-included diet with or without dietary counseling to adjust caloric intake will
           improve lipid panel, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, endothelial function and
           anthropometric measures in adults at risk for diabetes.

        -  Controlling calorie intake to keep it constant with the addition of walnuts to the diet
           will enhance the beneficial effects of walnut ingestion on diet quality, body
           composition, and vascular function.

    <measure>Diet Quality assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To help the study team track any variation in dietary pattern over the course of the study, all participants will be asked at five different time points to provide information on the foods and beverages that they consumed. A 3-day food diary record will be collected along with a one 24-hour recall using a web-based Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall (ASA24) (available from the National Cancer Institute at http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/) which will guide them through the process of completing the recall data. Diet quality will be assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).</description>

    <measure>Body Composition measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis and SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis, which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat. The Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer will be used to measure body composition. The SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer measures weight and calculates body fat% and total body water% in addition to BMI.</description>

    <measure>Endothelial Function (EF) Assessment using the brachial artery reactivity studies (BARS) methodology</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The brachial artery reactivity studies (BARS) methodology employed is as described in the published, &quot;Guidelines for Ultrasound Assessment of Endothelial-dependent Flow-mediated Vasodilation of the Brachial Artery.&quot; The measure of interest is flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometric Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured using a calibrated digital scale while height will be measured by using a calibrated stadiometer. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in meters (m) squared. Waist circumference will be measured using guidelines of the National Obesity Expert Panel Report.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lipid Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The lipid profile is determined as follows: Total cholesterol (Tchol), triglycerides (TRIG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are obtained by direct measurements. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) are obtained by calculation: VLDL = TRIG/5; and LDL = Tchol - (VLDL + HDL). HDL:Tchol ratio will be used to evaluate the impact of walnuts on the lipid profile.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ is a valid and reliable tool to assess physical activity in adults. It is a more comprehensive tool containing information on weekly activities in household and yard-work activities, occupational activity, transport, leisure time physical activity and sedentary behavior.</description>

    <description>The intervention group participants will meet with a registered dietitian and receive instructions and recipes for inclusion of 392 grams of walnuts per week (56g or 2 oz/day) in their meal plan. Participants will receive on-going instruction to preserve an isocaloric condition after the addition of walnuts. The study dietitian will customize dietary adjustments to make room for walnuts in the diet, while accommodating the priorities of each study participant. The general approach will emphasize general reduction in portion sizes; participants will also receive advice, based on baseline dietary intake analysis, of food eliminations that they might want to consider.</description>
