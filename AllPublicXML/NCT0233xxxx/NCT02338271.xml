      the operating room. The investigational product and the Tissuefill (hyaluronic acid
      derivatives) are mixed and placed in a 22 G syringe. A single dosage of 2ⅹ10^7 autologous
      adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells per person is administered on 5 subjects, and a single
      dosage of 4ⅹ10^7 cells per person is administered on 5 subjects, injected into the center of

      considered to be safe and tolerable, in the absence of the following types of
      counterevidence.

      - Adverse events of grade 3 (NCI grading system) or above related to the cell products/ any
      evidence that the cells were contaminated by pollutants / any evidence that the cells exhibit
      tumorigenic potential

           before the transplantation

        2. Change in the VAS at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplantation of autologous
           adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells, compared to before the transplantation

        4. Change in the Short Form (SF)-36 at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplantation
           of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells, compared to before the
           transplantation

        5. Assessment of the overall improvement in the Disc Height Index (hereinafter referred to
           as DHI) at 6 and 12 months after the transplantation of autologous adipose derived
