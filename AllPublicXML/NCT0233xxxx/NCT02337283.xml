  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      multiple rising doses of BI 425809 tablets given orally once daily for 12 days to young and
      elderly healthy male and female volunteers and to compare single dose pharmacokinetics of BI
      425809 given in the morning and in the evening.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects according to the investigatorÂ´s assessment, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure
             (BP), pulse rate (PR), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  age of 18 to 50 years (incl.) for young healthy volunteers or age of 65 to 80 years
             (incl.) for elderly healthy volunteers

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Female subjects who meet any of the following criteria:

               1. Surgically sterilised

               2. Postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
                  questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous levels of follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is
                  confirmatory)

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg in young subjects, and
             systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure greater than
             95 mmHg in elderly subjects, or pulse rate outside the range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial
             medication

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  Further exclusion criteria may apply
