    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (CHI) awaiting assisted reproduction usually
      require antiviral therapy due to vertical transmission risk and laboratory safety. However,
      no consensus is reached regarding the medication. This study aimed to explore the efficacy
      and safety of tenofovir (TDF) and telbivudine (LdT) in this population.
