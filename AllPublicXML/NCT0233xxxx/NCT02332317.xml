  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify whether patients with newly diagnosed advanced
      cancer benefit from a 12-week palliative rehabilitation program integrated with standard
      oncology treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      300 patients with newly diagnosed advanced cancer are planned to be enrolled. They wil be
      randomized at a 1:1 ratio to standard oncology treatment or standard oncology treatment plus
      a 12-week individually customized palliative rehabilitation program.

      The intervention takes place in a specialized palliative setting and is planned after an
      individual consultation with the patient and his relatives. It can be adjusted during the 12
      weeks according to the patient's symptoms and needs. All or part of the palliative
      rehabilitation program is organized as weekly group sessions at the hospital. The group
      sessions consist of lectures and debates followed by physical training. Professionals
      involved in the group sessions are doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists,
      occupational therapists, social workers, dietitians, and a priest.

      If needed, the patient and/or his relatives can also be offered individual sessions.

      All contacts with the patients or his relatives during the 12 weeks are registered in order
      to document the intervention retrospectively.

      The intervention is evaluated using questionnaires. All participants receive a questionnaire
      at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks. The questionnaire consists of EORTC-QLQ-C30 (a
      validated questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients) and HADS
      (the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). At baseline the questionnaire is
      extended with the question: &quot;Which of the following problems/ symptoms do you need help with
      the most?&quot;. The patients can choose between 12 defined problems matching 12 of the scales of
      EORTC-QLQ-C30 or &quot;none of the above&quot;. The answer given by the patient is labeled &quot;The Primary
      Problem&quot;.
