      The Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is a multi-center
      epidemiologic study in Hispanic/Latino populations to determine the role of acculturation in
      the prevalence and development of disease, and to identify risk factors playing a protective
      or harmful role in Hispanics/Latinos.

      Study goals include studying the prevalence and development of disease in Hispanics/Latinos,
      the role of acculturation, and to identify risk factors that play protective or harmful roles
      in Hispanics/Latinos. The target population of 16,000 persons of Hispanic/Latino origin,
      specifically Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Central/South American, to be recruited
      through four Field Centers affiliated with San Diego State University, Northwestern
      University in Chicago, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx area of New York, and
      the University of Miami. Seven additional academic centers serve as scientific and logistical
      support centers.

      Study participants aged 18-74 years underwent an extensive clinic exam and assessments to
      determine baseline risk factors. Annual follow-up interviews will be conducted for 2-4 years
      to determine health outcomes of interest. Study results will be disseminated through
      scientific journals and also conveyed to the communities involved in the study in order to
      improve public health at the local level. Annual follow-up interviews will be conducted for
      2-4 years to determine health outcomes of interest. Study results will be disseminated
      through scientific journals and also conveyed to the communities involved in the study in

    <description>This is a population-based cohort study of 16,400 Hispanic/Latinos. Objectives:
Examination of the cohort following a standardized protocol
Follow-up of the cohort to assess vital status, changes in health status, medication intake, and new cardiovascular and pulmonary events (fatal and non-fatal MI, heart failure, stroke, asthma, and COPD.
Understand the relationship between changes in risk factors and protective factors and onset of CV and pulmonary disease progression
Understand the relationship between changes in sociocultural factors and changes in health
Understand the relationship between baseline CV risk profile of women of childbearing age and incidence of select pregnancy complications</description>
