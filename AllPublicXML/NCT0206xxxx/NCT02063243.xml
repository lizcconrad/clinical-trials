      This prospective evaluation studies the effectiveness of Intralesional (IL) cryotherapy with
      a argon gas based device in treating keloids and hypertrophic scars in population consisting
      of all Fitzpatrick skin type patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intralesional (IL) cryotherapy is a novel treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars, in
      which the scar is frozen from inside. Published results are promising, however only Caucasian
      patient populations have been studied. This prospective evaluation studies the effectiveness
      of IL cryotherapy in treating keloids and hypertrophic scars in a population consisting of
      all Fitzpatrick skin type patients.

      Multiple devices are available, mostly based on a simple open system. Closed, argon gas
      based, systems are highly controlled and provide accurate freezing. However, this technique
      has never been used for IL cryotherapy for the treatment of keloid or hypertrophic scars. All
      patients with keloid or hypertrophic scars meeting inclusion criteria were treated with a
      argon based device called Seednet. Scar quality and possible recurrence are assessed pre- and
      postsurgery (3, 6 and 12 months) with objective devices determine scar color, scar
      elasticity, scar volume and patient's skin type. In addition, scars are evaluated using the
      Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Keloids, defined as excessive scar tissue raised above skin level and proliferating
             beyond the confines of the original lesion

          -  Hypertrophic scars1 older than 12 months and insensitive to other treatments. Keloids
             were distinguished from hypertrophic scars based on the clinical judgment of
             experienced plastic surgeons and on the age of the scar (&gt;1yr)

          -  A period between previous treatment and IL cryotherapy covered a minimum of 12 weeks

          -  Patients with all Fitzpatrick17 skin types

          -  Patients older than 10 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy

          -  diabetes mellitus
