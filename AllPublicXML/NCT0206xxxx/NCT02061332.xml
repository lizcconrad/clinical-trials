    <textblock>
      Women who are diagnosed with Her-2/neu over-expressing DCIS will receive DC1 vaccines by
      intranodal, intralesional, or both routes of administration. The primary objective will be
      safety and administration with secondary objectives of immune activation and clinical
      response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of patients with DCIS can be individualized and tailored to the type of DCIS
      and the relative risk of the lesion. HER-2/neu over-expressing DCIS represents a group of
      patients with significant risk for development of invasive breast cancer. In this proposal we
      will continue to evaluate the development of type I polarized DC for the treatment of DCIS by
      evaluating whether further improvements in therapeutic response can be achieved by
      intratumoral administration of HER-2/neu pulsed DC1 compared with our current intranodal
      administration. Women who are diagnosed with Her-2/neu over-expressing DCIS with no invasive
      carcinoma will be eligible for this study. Patients will receive DC1 vaccines by intranodal,
      intralesional, or both routes of administration. The primary objective will be safety and
      administration with secondary objectives of immune activation and clinical response. We will
      also develop a novel assay to monitor ongoing immunity to HER-2/neu, and lastly will begin to
      develop these vaccines for patients with invasive breast cancer as well. Fifty-four subjects
      will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: intranodal injection, intralesional
      injection, or intranodal and intralesional injection of the vaccine. Upon entering this
      study, the subjects' blood will be drawn in a way that collects only the white blood cells.
      Subjects then receive six vaccines over a six week period. They will then undergo the
      standard surgical procedure to remove any remaining DCIS in the breast.

    <description>An ultrasound device (probe) will be placed over the area of the groin or armpit. The vaccine needle will then be placed under the probe, and guided by the ultrasound machine to the groin lymph nodes or axillary nodes. You will be given a HER-2 pulsed dendritic cell vaccine in two different groin lymph nodes or axillary nodes per visit. Each dose will consist of 1.0-2.0 x 107 cells and will be injected into 1-2 different groin lymph nodes or axillary nodes.</description>

    <description>The HER-2 pulsed dendritic cell vaccine will be directly injected into the quadrant of the breast affected with DCIS. The location will be determined by referring to the patient's mammogram. Each dose will consist of 1.0-2.0 x 107 cells and will be injected into the quadrant of the breast affected with DCIS.</description>

The vaccine needle will be placed under the probe, and guided by the ultrasound machine to the groin lymph nodes or axillary nodes. The intralesional vaccine will be directly injected into the quadrant of the breast affected with DCIS. The location will be determined by referring to the patient's mammogram. Each dose will consist of 1.0-2.0 x 107 cells. Approximately half of the dose will be injected into 1-2 different groin lymph nodes or axillary nodes. The remaining half will be injected into the quadrant of the breast affected with DCIS.</description>
