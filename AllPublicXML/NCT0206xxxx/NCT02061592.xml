    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of comfort was performed using the Contact Lens User Experience TM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE was a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens- wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicated a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0 to 120.</description>

    <time_frame>1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>LogMar visual acuity within each eye was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity charts. A LogMar acuity value of 0 indicates that a subject has 20/20 vision.Positive LogMar acuity values indicate worsened vision while negative LogMar acuity values would indicated improved vision.</description>

             -0.50 to -7.50 D in each eye.

          -  The subject must be a habitual and adapted wearer of daily disposable contact lenses
             in both eyes.

          -  The subject must self-report their race as Asian

        <description>Subjective assessment of comfort was performed using the Contact Lens User Experience TM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE was a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens- wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicated a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0 to 120.</description>
