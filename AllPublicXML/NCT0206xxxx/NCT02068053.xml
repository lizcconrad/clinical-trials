  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, routes and
      extent of elimination, as well as safety and tolerability of a single oral solution dose of
      [14C] Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)-986020 in healthy male subjects.

      Primary purpose: Other - This study will investigate the pharmacokinetic, biotransformation,
      routes of elimination, and mass balance of BMS-986020 in humans. The knowledge of the routes
      of elimination of the drug and its metabolites is useful for evaluating the likelihood of
      effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the disposition of BMS-986020
