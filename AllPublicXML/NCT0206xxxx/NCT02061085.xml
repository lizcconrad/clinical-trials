      Multicentre, prospective, non-controlled phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of first line single agent Eribulin in patients with HER2-negative metastatic
      breast carcinoma previously exposed to taxanes for early stage.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the median time to progression achieved
      with Eribulin. Other secondary objectives will be; overall response rate, clinical benefit
      rate, time to treatment progression, duration of response and toxicity profile.
