      The purpose of the study is to establish drug-induced liver injury databases in China, make
      criteria for Chinese drug-induced liver injury patients and evaluate the application of
      certain circulating miRNA in diagnosis or treatment of drug-induced liver injury.

    <textblock>
      Firstly, this study collects some retrospective data. Analyse these data and establish
      certain unique diagnostic criteria for Chinese. Then collect prospective data and validate
      the criteria. Otherwise,collect blood sample or other sample of the patients and study
      certain miRNA in diagnosis or treatment of drug-induced liver injury.
