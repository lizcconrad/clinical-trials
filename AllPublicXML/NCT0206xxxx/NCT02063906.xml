  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the investigators face &quot;on the edges&quot; for treatment decision to decide adjuvant
      systemic treatment, especially for patients who show discordance between stage and tumor
      biology. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic relevance of the TNM staging
      system and intrinsic subtype in breast cancer patients who received curative surgery.

    <textblock>
      Identified patients who received curative surgery for stage I-III breast cancer and had
      available data on immunohistochemistry profiles including hormone receptor status (HR)
      status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and Ki 67 staining at Samsung
      Medical Center from January 2004 to September 2008. Primary outcomes were recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).
