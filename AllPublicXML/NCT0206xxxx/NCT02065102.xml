  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery stenting has evolved as an effective treatment for angina and involves
      stretching up narrowings within the heart arteries using a balloon (coronary angioplasty)
      before implanting a small metal scaffold (stent) to splint the artery open. It is imperative
      that stents are fully expanded when they are deployed. If not, then patients are exposed to
      the serious risk of a blood clot forming in the stent (stent thrombosis), or the stent
      renarrowing (restenosis). One fifth of patients experiencing stent thrombosis will die and
      70% will suffer a heart attack. Restenosis is associated with recurrent angina and heart
      attacks.

      Arguably, visualising stents and ensuring adequate stent expansion is most challenging in
      patients with extensive hardening, or calcification, of the heart arteries. Optical coherence
      tomography is a novel technique that utilises near-infrared light to look inside small blood
      vessels in fine detail. It is 10 times more powerful than the best existing technique,
      intravascular ultrasound.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the utility of optical coherence tomography with
      intravascular ultrasound in patients with heavily calcified heart arteries undergoing
      rotational atherectomy and coronary stent insertion. It is hoped that the results of this
      pilot study will provide proof-of-principle and justification for a larger clinical trial to
      formally assess the role of optical coherence tomography to guide coronary angioplasty and
      stenting in patients with heavily calcified coronary arteries.

      Twelve patients undergoing rotational atherectomy and coronary stenting for angina in Lothian
      will be recruited. Rotational atherectomy and stent implantation will be performed as part of
      routine clinical care. Immediately following stent implantation paired intravascular images
      of the implanted stent will be obtained using both intravascular ultrasound and optical
      coherence tomography. The stent will then be further dilated at high pressure with a non
      compliant balloon and the intravascular images repeated with both intravascular ultrasound
      and optical coherence tomography. The images obtained will be available to the operator to
      guide further treatment.
