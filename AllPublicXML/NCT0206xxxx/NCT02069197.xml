  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketogenic diet (KD)
      treatment of (i) obesity, (ii) type 2 diabetes mellitus and (iii) obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) in patients with obesity and Type 2 DM and in patients with obesity and/or OSA. This
      will be a randomized, open-label three arm controlled study comparing weight loss in obese
      participants with type 2 diabetes and/or obstructive sleep apnea treated for 9 months with
      3:1 [fat]:[protein+carbohydrate] ratio, 1600 kcal/day diet (Group A) with weight loss in
      participants treated with orlistat 120 mg TID and lifestyle intervention consisting of
      dietary advice, recommended caloric goal of 1600 kcal/day (Group B), and in participants
      treated with only lifestyle intervention consisting of dietary advice, recommended caloric
      goal of 1600 kcal/day (Group C).

      The study sample will be randomized into three treatment arms, KD (Group A, n=50), Orlistat
      120 mg TID (Group B, n=50) and dietary and lifestyle counseling (Group C, n=50) in a 1:1:1
      ratio. Each arm will include 100% participants with obesity and co-morbid type 2 DM and 50%
      participants with co-morbid OSA. Randomization will be stratified for diabetic status.
