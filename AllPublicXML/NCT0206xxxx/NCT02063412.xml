  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the possible time savings from reduction of nursing
      and pharmacy time to manage AEGC patients using capecitabine-based regimens versus
      traditional intravenous chemotherapy in the Hong Kong public hospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced esophageal and gastric cancer (AEGC) have ranked in the top 10 cancer-related cause
      of death worldwide, with approximately one million new cases each year. Over half of new
      cases are in East Asia. The traditional chemotherapy for AEGC remains on intravenous (IV)
      fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and the anthracyclines. Trials favoured the combined use of
      5-FU and cisplatin for superior efficacy and quality of life in AEGC patients. Recent years,
      oral chemotherapy has a more practical and economic advantages over IV regimen. It is
      understandable that patients prefer oral regimens as long as the clinical efficacy is
      maintained. Oral treatment strategy preserves quality of life for AEGC patients. In addition,
      it may also have additional cost saving in the nursing and pharmacy time. It is because a
      significant amount of time can be saved in both nursing and pharmacy for the preparation and
      administration of IV chemotherapy However, there is a lack of local data to demonstrate the
      impact of pharmacy and nursing care utilizing capecitabine-based regimen comparing to
      traditional IV chemotherapy in MCRC patients of Hong Kong.
