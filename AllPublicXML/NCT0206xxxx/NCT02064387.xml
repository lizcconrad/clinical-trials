  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and the
      therapeutic potential of GSK2857916 in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphomas that
      express B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The hypothesis is that GSK2857916 can be safely
      administered to subjects with MM and with BCMA positive malignancies at doses where target
      engagement can be demonstrated. This study will determine if adequate target engagement of
      BCMA receptors translates into clinical benefit for subjects with MM and BCMA positive
      lymphomas. The study will consists of two parts: a Part 1 dose escalation phase and a Part 2
      expansion phase for safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity testing. The study
      will enroll a total of approximately 80-95 subjects with relapsed/refractory MM or
      BCMA-expressing hematologic malignancies. The maximum dose to be administered in this trial
      will not exceed 5 milligram/kilogram(mg/kg).
