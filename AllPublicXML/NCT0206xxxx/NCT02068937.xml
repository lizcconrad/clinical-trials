  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges in treating patients with heart failure (HF) is achieving clinical
      stability and reducing the hospital readmission rate. A diuretic dose adjustment algorithm
      developed in the United States (Diuretic Treatment Algorithm, DTA) and later validated for
      use in Brazil (as the Algoritmo de Ajuste de Diurético, AAD) has proved feasible and readily
      applicable, but its effect on clinical outcomes has yet to be assessed. This report aims to
      describe a randomized clinical trial protocol designed to assess the effectiveness of the AAD
      and of nonpharmacologic management in improving clinical stability and reducing the
      readmission rate at 90 days in patients with HF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded endpoint) parallel-group design will be used.
      Adult patients with a diagnosis of reduced ejection fraction HF, who are being treated at a
      specialized HF clinic are being recruited. Those with indications for loop diuretic dose
      adjustment during routine clinic visits will be randomized to take part in the trial.
      Participants in the intervention group (IG) shall have their diuretic doses adjusted in
      accordance with the AAD and receive four telephone calls (one per week) over 30 days to
      reinforce guidance on nonpharmacological management (fluid and sodium restriction).
      Participants in the control group (CG) shall have their diuretic doses adjusted by a
      physician during the first trial visit and shall not receive any telephone calls. Patients in
      both groups shall return at 1 month for face-to-face reassessment. The study endpoints shall
      comprise readmission and/or emergency department visits due to HF decompensation within 90
      days and clinical instability. All participants shall be required to have a scale at home (or
      easy access to one), a telephone number, agree to telephone-based follow-up, and be available
      to return for a 1-month trial visit. Overall, 135 patients are expected to be enrolled in
      each group.

    <description>In the control group, patients just diuretic adjusted (Furosemide 40 milligrams) by the doctor on the baseline. The patients do not receive phone calls neither advising on non-pharmacological treatment; The medication is adjusted by the doctor during the initial evaluation of study baseline.</description>

    <description>The intervention group is conducted by a nurse in a systematic way during one time per week. If signs and symptoms of congestion, the dose of diuretic ( furosemide ) is revised , nonpharmacological guidelines are provided. According to the algorithm 1KG weight changes are indicative of modifying the diuretic dose , with the addition or reduction 1 tablet a day.</description>
