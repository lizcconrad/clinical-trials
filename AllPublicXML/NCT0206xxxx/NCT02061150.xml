  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns. Due to strict
      criteria and in order to diagnose and prevent early-onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS)
      sepsis, many infants undergo a sepsis workup due to risk factors alone, even though they are
      asymptomatic. Our goal is to evaluate the number of newborns that undergo sepsis workup due
      to risk factors alone, to determine the number of newborns having positive blood cultures,
      and to establish ways to reduce the number of asymptomatic infants undergoing sepsis workup.
