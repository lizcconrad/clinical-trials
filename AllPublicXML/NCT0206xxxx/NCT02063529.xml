      PURPOSE:

      A primary aim of phase II FOCULM study is to explore whether cetuximab in combination with
      FOLFOXIRI as first treatment could improve surgical conversion in patients with KRAS/NRAS
      wild-type, unresectable liver - only metastases of colorectal cancer. The first secondary aim
      is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the chemotherapy of FOLFOXIRI plus Cetuximab
      targeted therapy regimen in this patient population.

      Secondary aims include determination of objective response rate, progression free survival,
      quality of life and time to recurrence for patients undergoing complete resection and/or
      ablation of liver.

      Patients will be randomized to two therapy groups:
