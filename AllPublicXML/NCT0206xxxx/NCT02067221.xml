  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to investigate the surgical outcomes of minimally invasive
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy(MPCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS)for patients with
      renal stone larger than 1cm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is pointed out that there is the disadvantage of conventional PCNL technique which showed
      dramatic decrease in Hb and renal damage even though it has some advantages of a short
      operation time and a high stone-free rate. MPCNL and RIRS has recently been considered as
      very efficacious methods.
