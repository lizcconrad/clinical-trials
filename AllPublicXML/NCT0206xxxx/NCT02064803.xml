  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of unresectable and obstructive gastric cancer patients ranges in the
      literature from 5 to 30 % . In such cases, gastro-entero anastomosis is traditionally
      performed and can improve the quality of life by relieving the symptoms of impaired oral
      intake without having a high surgical risk. Unfortunately, up to 25% of these patients may
      develop impaired gastric emptying syndrome. Gastric partitioning was originally described by
      Devine in 1925 as a method of antral exclusion and complete division of the stomach
      accompanied by a gastro-entero anastomosis in the proximal gastric pouch for the management
      of difficult duodenal ulcers. This procedure has been modified along the years and was
      adopted for the palliative treatment of gastric cancer. The advantages of the partitioning
      includes: better gastric emptying, avoidance of direct tumor invasion of the gastro-entero
      anastomosis, less contact between the ingested food and the tumor with less blood lost and
      improved survival. Retrospective not randomized studies have been published demonstrating the
      effectiveness of the procedure.

      The first group (Group A) will be considered the control group in which patients will undergo
      gastro-entero anastomosis. The anastomosis will be pre-colic, along the posterior wall of the
      stomach with the length of at least 5 cm. The first jejunal loop approximately 40 cm from the
      angle of Treitz will be used. The anastomosis can be performed manually or with staplers.

      The second group (group B) will be considered the intervention group in which patients will
      undergo gastric partitioning plus gastro-entero anastomosis. The gastric partitioning is done
      5 cm proximal to the lesion along the greater curvature towards the lesser curvature above
      the incisura using linear cutting stapler. The partitioning is performed horizontally and
      preserve a narrow tunnel along the lesser curvature that is calibrated with a orogastric tube
      gauge 32. Subsequently, a pre-colic gastro-entero anastomosis is performed in the proximal
      gastric chamber created by the partitioning. The anastomosis is done along the posterior
      wall, with at least 5 cm of length using the first jejunal loop approximately 40 cm from the
      angle of Treitz. The anastomosis can be performed manually or with staplers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with distal obstructive gastric tumors without indication of curative or
             palliative resection.

          -  Obstruction is defined as GOOSS (Gastric outlet obstruction score system) of 2 or
             less, associated with early vomiting and bloating if the patient try to keep the usual
             volume of food intake.
