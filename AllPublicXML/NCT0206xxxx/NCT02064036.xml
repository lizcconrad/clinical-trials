  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Boost (SBRT) as a boost to the prostate
      following whole pelvic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can be delivered effectively
      and safely in a population of men with unfavorable intermediate and high risk localized
      prostate cancer.

      Our primary objective is to assess the feasibility and safety of a treatment strategy
      incorporating whole pelvic IMRT followed by an SBRT boost to the prostate with neoadjuvant,
      concurrent, and adjuvant androgen deprivation for a total of 28 months for men with
      unfavorable intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of a treatment
      strategy incorporating whole pelvic IMRT followed by an SBRT boost to the prostate with
      neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant androgen deprivation for a total of 28 months for men
      with unfavorable intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer.

      The secondary objective is to assess biochemical control at 24 months following the
      experimental treatment strategy by the &quot;Phoenix definition&quot;. Patients not meeting these PSA
      criteria (Phoenix Definition) for failure who undergo salvage therapies (such as ADT, radical
      prostatectomy or brachytherapy, or Cryosurgery) should also be declared as failures at the
      time a positive biopsy is obtained or salvage therapy is administered, whichever comes first.

      Another secondary objective is to assess toxicity of the experimental treatment approach as
      scored by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events The third secondary objective is
      to assess prostate organ motion during hypofractionated radiotherapy. To assess motion of the
      prostate during the protracted delivery of hypofractionated radiotherapy as assessed by
      implanted EM transponder beacons.

             adenocarcinoma within 180 days of registration at moderate to high risk for recurrence
