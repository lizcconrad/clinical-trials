        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric carcinoma,
             including gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
             (Participants with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus are eligible if the primary
             tumor involves the GEJ)

          -  The participant has metastatic disease or locally recurrent, unresectable disease

          -  The participant has measureable or evaluable disease as determined by standard
             computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Examples of
             evaluable, nonmeasurable disease include gastric, peritoneal, or mesenteric thickening
             in areas of known disease, or peritoneal nodules that are too small to be considered
             measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1)

          -  The participant has experienced disease progression during treatment or within 4
             months after the last dose of first-line therapy for metastatic disease, or during
             treatment, or within 6 months after the last dose of adjuvant therapy

             o Acceptable prior chemotherapy regimens for this protocol are combination
             chemotherapy regimens that include platinum and/or fluoropyrimidine components.
             Regimens including a third agent, such as an anthracycline or a taxane, are acceptable
             provided a fluoropyrimidine and/or a platinum were used.

          -  The participant has resolution to Grade ≤1 (or to Grade ≤2 in the case of neuropathy)
             by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (NCI-CTCAE), Version 4.03, of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior
             chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy (with the exception of
             alopecia)

          -  The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
             score of 0 or 1

          -  The participant has adequate hepatic function

          -  The participant does not have:

               -  cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or

               -  cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically
                  meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Clinically meaningful ascites is
                  defined as ascites from cirrhosis requiring diuretics or paracentesis

          -  The participant has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour
             urine collection) ≥40 milliliter per minute (mL/minute)

          -  The participant's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA)

          -  The participant has adequate hematologic function

          -  The participant must have adequate coagulation function

          -  If the participant has received prior anthracycline therapy as part of his or her
             first-line regimen, the participant is able to engage in ordinary physical activity
             without significant fatigue or dyspnea (equivalent to New York Heart Association Class
             I function)

          -  Because the teratogenicity of ramucirumab is not known, the participant, if sexually
             active, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier methods)

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 7 days prior to enrollment

             mercury (mmHg) systolic or &gt;100 mmHg diastolic for &gt;4 weeks] despite standard medical
             management

          -  The participant has a serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28
             days prior to enrollment

             enrollment

          -  The participant is receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin,
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; including ibuprofen, naproxen, and
             others), dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Once-daily aspirin use
             (maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted

          -  The participant has elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the

          -  The participant has a known allergy to any of the treatment components
