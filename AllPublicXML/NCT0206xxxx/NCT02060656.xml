    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, phase II open-labelled two-arm study comparing R-GEM-P and LR-GEM in
      second-line treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients will be randomised
      1:1 between R-GEM-P and LR-GEM.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      To assess the complete response rate to LR-GEM (lenalidomide, rituximab, gemcitabine and
      methylprednisolone) and R-GEM-P (rituximab, gemcitabine,cisplatin and methylprednisolone)
      following 3 cycles of induction treatment as secondline therapy for patients with Diffuse
      Large B-cell Lymphoma.

      To investigate in both arms:

        -  Overall response rate following 3 cycles of induction treatment evaluated by IWG 2007
           criteria

        -  Event-free survival

        -  Overall survival

        -  Rate of successful stem cell harvest

        -  Toxicity

        -  Subgroup analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint by cell-of-origin
           immunohistochemical subtype using the Choi method[2] (GCB vs non-GCB), morphological
           subtype (centroblastic vs immunoblastic vs other), IPI (0-1 vs ³2),and previous response
           to treatment (£12 vs &gt; 12 months), and eligibility for ASCT at randomisation.

      Treatment:

      LR-GEM: lenalidomide plus rituximab, gemcitabine and methylprednisolone every 28 days.
      R-GEM-P: rituximab, gemcitabine, methylprednisolone and cisplatin every 28 days.

      Assessment Schedule:

        -  Patients will be reviewed at baseline and prior to each scheduled dose of treatment for
           toxicity

        -  Radiological tumour assessment will be done with contrast-enhanced CT scan after the 1st
           and 3rd cycles in both arms.

        -  PET/CT scan will be performed at baseline and upon completion of induction treatment
           (3-4 weeks after last dose of chemotherapy). If PET/CT scan is performed with a
           contrast-enhanced CT, then patients do not need a separate CT scan.

        -  Follow up after completion of induction treatment will be at 3 monthly intervals for the
           first 12 months in Arm A and at monthly intervals for the first 12 months for patients
           in Arm B. Thereafter follow up in both Arm A and B will be at 6 monthly intervals for 2
           years, then annually up until 5 years in total.

        -  CT scan at 3 &amp; 12 months post induction treatment in both arms

        -  Following disease progression patients will be followed for survival every 3 months
           until death
