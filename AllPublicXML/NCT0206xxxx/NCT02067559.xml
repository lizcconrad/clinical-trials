  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to test the feasibility of the ICU diaries intervention in
      the ICU. The investigators do not have sufficient power to detect differences in the
      hypotheses below, but will use the present pilot study to inform sample size required to
      adequately power a follow-up randomized control trial.

      (1) The investigators hypothesize that subjects exposed to a psychoeducation condition will
      have reduced rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to those experiencing
      treatment as usual (TAU). (2) The investigators hypothesize that compared to participants in
      the psychoeducation and TAU groups, those subjects exposed to an ICU diary, and those exposed
      to both ICU diary + psychoeducation conditions, will have significantly reduced rates of PTSD
      at follow-up. (3)The investigators hypothesize that participants exposed to the ICU diary +
      psychoeducation condition will have significantly lower rates of PTSD compared to those in
      the ICU diary alone condition.

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study involving patients who are in the ICU, for a
      minimum of 72 hrs with &gt; 24 hrs mechanical ventilation. As is common in ICU research, proxy
      consent will be obtained from family members upon ICU admission. Patients will be randomized
      to 4 different conditions (1) treatment as usual (TAU) (2) ICU diary (3) psychoeducation (4)
      ICU diary + psychoeducation. The ICU diary will be created and maintained by nurses and
      family members for each patient randomized to condition (2) and (4), and will be given to
      patients by a research nurse upon discharge from the ICU. The patients in conditions (3) and
      (4) will receive a psychoeducational brochure detailing general treatment and sedation
      patients receive in the ICU, and the psychological symptoms such as depression and PTSD that
      can occur after a stay in the ICU. This brochure will also be sent to their follow-up
      physician. Patients in all conditions will be assessed at one week post-ICU for recollection
      of delusional memories using ICU Memory Tool (ICUMT), at one- and three-month post-ICU for
      baseline PTSD symptoms using Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), a commonly used measure
      of PTSD symptomatology, as well as measures of anxiety/depression, social support, and
      general health. At one and three month follow-up, the investigators will also ask patients if
      they had contact with their health care providers/follow-up physicians, sought mental health
      treatment, their general impressions of the intervention they received (diary,
      psychoeducation, both), and whether/how often they reviewed the document (if in conditions
      2-4). The investigators will ascertain feasibility from the health care provider and family
      perspective by appending a short questionnaire to the diary, to be filled out each time an
      entry is made.

    <description>To test the feasibility of ICU diaries in a Canadian ICU setting by asking nurses and family members about the process of creating the diary.
Specifically, feasibility of diary will be determined by a survey about the usability, time spent, and general comments on using the diary. Surveys will be filled by each individual making a diary entry (visitors and hospital staff).</description>

    <description>The investigators will measure patients' Impact of Event Scores - Revised (IES-R) at 90 days post-ICU discharge. These scores will be compared across the four intervention groups (ICU Diaries, Psychoeducation, ICU Diary + Psychoeducation, Treatment as Usual).</description>

    <description>The investigators will measure differences (across treatment groups) between participant's Impact of Event Scores (IES-R) at 30 days post-discharge, and proportion of participants accessing follow-up care (psychiatric, psychological, primary care) at 90 days post-ICU discharge.
The investigators will also assess anxiety, depression, quality of life scores, and social support scores 30 and 90 days post-ICU discharge, and measure the associations between these factors and the ICU Memory Tool (ICUMT) scores.</description>

    <description>A bound empty journal will be stored at the patient's bedside near the nurse charting area. All family members and ICU staff are invited to write in the ICU diary at any time. Instructions will be provided to the patient's family at the time of randomization and will be available at the bedside for reference. Staff instructions will be posted at charting area for staff. During the patient's stay in ICU, the diary will never leave the unit. Under no circumstances will any part of an ICU diary be duplicated. Research staff will take a photograph of the patient after consent is obtained and the photograph will be mounted on the first page of the diary. Photographs will be taken with a Polaroid camera; therefore there will be no other record of the photograph.</description>

    <description>The research nurse will provide a psychoeducational brochure to study participants at ICU discharge (if cognitive capacity is established) or 30 days after ICU discharge. If participants are not well enough 30 days post-discharge, they will be assessed every two weeks by research staff until the brochure is given to them. The brochure will describe procedures in the ICU (sedation, ventilation), and the delirium, hallucinations, and trauma that may result; as well as symptoms of PTSD post-ICU. It will provide instructions for follow-up, information, and emergency care. The brochure will instruct participants to contact their follow-up healthcare provider if they have any questions. The document will also be mailed to the participant's follow-up physician.</description>
