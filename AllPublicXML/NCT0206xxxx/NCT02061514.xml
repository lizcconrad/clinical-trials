      -  Major surgery can lead to postoperative disturbances in sleep patterns with subjective
           deterioration of sleep quality according to patients' reports as well as objective
           alterations of sleep architecture, as recorded by polysomnography

        -  Factors implicated in postoperative sleep disturbances include but are not limited to
           the severity of the surgical procedure, the neuroendocrine response to surgery,
           inadequate treatment of postoperative pain and external factors interfering with sleep,
           such as light, noise and therapeutic procedures

        -  There are differences in the molecular mechanisms inhalational anesthetics and
           intravenous agents affect different brain regions to induce anesthesia. Our hypothesis
           is that these differences may also be evident during the postoperative period, affecting
           brain functions which are involved in postoperative sleep architecture. So, the aim of
           this study will be to assess the effect of two different anesthetic techniques (propofol
           versus desflurane) of maintaining general anesthesia in patients subjected to similar
           major operations

        -  Patients will be assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI),
           regarding preoperative and long term postoperative sleep quality, sleep diaries
           regarding early postoperative sleep quality and biochemical markers (cortisol, prolactin
           and melatonin) regarding neuroendocrine response to surgery and disturbances in
           endogenous circadian secretion associated with sleep

      -  Major surgery can lead to postoperative disturbances in sleep patterns with subjective
           deterioration of sleep quality according to patients' reports as well as objective
           alterations of sleep architecture, as recorded by polysomnography

        -  These disturbances include severe sleep fragmentation, rapid eye movement (REM) and slow
           wave sleep significant reductions in duration as well as an increase in non-REM sleep
           stages. Spontaneous awakenings are also frequently reported

        -  After the third or fourth postoperative day, there is a substantial rebound in total REM
           activity, with frequent reports of vivid nightmares

        -  Factors implicated in postoperative sleep disturbances include but are not limited to
           the severity of the surgical procedure, the neuroendocrine response to surgery,
           inadequate treatment of postoperative pain and external factors interfering with sleep,
           such as light, noise and therapeutic procedures

        -  There are differences in the molecular mechanisms inhalational anesthetics and
           intravenous agents affect different brain regions to induce anesthesia. Our hypothesis
           is that these differences may also be evident during the postoperative period, affecting
           brain functions which are involved in sleep architecture, since sleep is an altered
           state of consciousness like anesthesia. So, the aim of this study will be to assess the
           effect of two different anesthetic techniques of maintaining general anesthesia in
           patients subjected to similar major operations

        -  Patients taking part in the study will be evaluated regarding their preoperative sleep
           quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI). The PSQI examines seven
           components of sleep quality retrospectively over a period of four weeks: subjective
           sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep
           disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.
           The patient self-rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of answers is based
           on a 0-3 scale, whereby '3' reflects the negative extreme on the Likert scale. The
           global score is generated by summing up all seven component scores and ranges from 0 to
           21, with higher values corresponding to reduced sleep quality.

        -  Consequently, patients will be randomized to one of two groups: one group with general
           anesthesia maintenance based on an intravenous agent (propofol) and a second group with
           general anesthesia maintenance based on an inhalational agent (desflurane)

        -  Patients will be assessed postoperatively with sleep diaries regarding potential sleep
           disturbances while they will be subjected to a long-term assessment of sleep quality by
           the use of the PSQI one and three months postoperatively

        -  Since anesthetic-related differences in hormone profiles are expected, markers related
           to the neuroendocrine response to stress (cortisol, prolactin) will also be assessed to
           investigate differences between the two different anesthetic regimes

        -  Impaired melatonin secretion has been proposed as one of the mechanisms involved in
           postoperative sleep disturbances. It is therefore expected that different methods of
           anesthetic maintenance may affect the endogenous circadian melatonin rhythm in a
           different way. Consequently, melatonin secretion will also be measured to investigate
           potential desynchronization of melatonin rhythm as well as differences in melatonin
           secretion between the two different anesthetic techniques

        -  The clinical implications of this study lie in the fact that postoperative sleep
           disturbances can lead to postoperative hemodynamic instability, episodic hypoxemia and
           mental status deterioration, which can all untowardly affect the short and long-term
           postoperative outcome. It would be interesting to determine whether one of the two
           anesthetic regimes is superior to the other as far as postoperative disturbances in
           sleep architecture are concerned
