  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability and maximum
      tolerated dose of BMS-986016 administered alone or in combination with Nivolumab to subjects
      with relapsed hematologic malignancies. Co-primary objective is to investigate the
      preliminary efficacy of BMS-986016 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and relapsed or refractory Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL)
