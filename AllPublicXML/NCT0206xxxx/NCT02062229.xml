  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a common problem, affecting perhaps one couple in six, the majority of whom
      now seek medical care. It is becoming a social challenge because it is responsible for
      personal and interpersonal discomfort and anxiety. A major obstacle to meaningful study of
      the epidemiology of male infertility is the difficulty in accurate diagnosis of the presence
      or absence of a problem. Traditionally, the diagnosis of male infertility is facilitated by
      the conventional assessment of the semen profile - constructed according to recognized
      guidelines (i.e. WHO) and including pH, cell count and motility - but no specific biomarkers
      are available.

      We sought to determine the oxysterol and fatty acid lipidome with the ai of finding a lipid
      biomarker useful for the diagnosis of male infertility.

      Subjects referring to an outpatient infertility laboratory will be enrolled in the study. A
      complete clinical record is collected as well as a sperm and a fasting blood sample. Patients
      are stratified according to current guidelines focusing on sperm and anatomical
      characteristics. Sperm characteristics will be studied on fresh samples immediately after
      collection; blood samples will be centrifuged and plasma stored at -80Â°C until analysis that
      include routine glucose and lipid profile by commercial kits. Vitamin E (alpha- and
      gamma-tocopherol), oxysterols profiling, and fatty acids profiling is analyzed by state of
      the art gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using isotope dilution methods.
