  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Folic acid (FA) and its derivatives (folate) which play a role in nucleotide synthesis and
      methylation reactions as well as calcium and vitamin D are assumed to be effective in the
      prevention of colorectal polyps and Colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study is to
      investigate the roles of FA as well as calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of CRC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects approximately one million people each year with a five-year
      survival rate of 62% . Considerable interest has recently been focused on the relationship
      between the chemoprevention of colorectal polyps/CRA and CRC. Therefore, the use of
      nutritional compounds which are usually less afflicted with the risk of severe side effects
      for colorectal adenoma (CRA) prevention and health maintenance is an emerging field.
