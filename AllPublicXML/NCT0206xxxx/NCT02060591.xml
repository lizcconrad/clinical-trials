  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators aim to study the efficacy of Exparel as compared to Marcaine, taking into
      account pain control, narcotic consumption, narcotic-related side effects, outcomes measures,
      and patient satisfaction. Moreover, the Investigators plan to perform cost-benefit analysis
      to evaluate whether use of Exparel decreases analgesic consumption, duration of hospital stay
      and the need for physical therapy postoperatively, therefore, offsetting its higher price in
      comparison with Marcaine.
