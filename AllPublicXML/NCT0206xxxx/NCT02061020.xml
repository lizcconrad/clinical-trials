    <textblock>
      Study of the effects of smoked cannabis consumption on performance on a driving simulator and
      reaction time. The study aims to explore the relationship between concentrations of cannabis
      in the blood, driving performance and reaction time.

      This study will examine:

        -  The relationship between THC blood levels and driving performance measured on a York
           Driving simulator

        -  The relationship between THC blood levels and reaction times as measured on the
           psychomotor vigilance test (PVT)

        -  the pharmacokinetics of THC in occasional and chronic cannabis consumers

        -  Determine the minimum blood concentration level of THC and 11-OH-THC, below which no
           effect of cannabis is observed

        -  Determine whether the polymorphism of CYP2C9 (* 3) is associated with the AUC, Cmax, and
           higher THC T1/2

        -  Determine if the polymorphism of CYP2C9 (* 3) is associated with different
           pharmacodynamic effects at a given THC level on performance measured by driving
           simulation

    <description>Smoked THC containing cigarettes. Randomly allocated dosage 30mg, 10mg et placebo.
Both chronic and occasional cannabis consuming volunteers will be allocated to smoking a cigarette containing (1) no THC (placebo), (2) a joint containing 1% THC (10 mg THC, i.e. low-dose) and (3) a joint containing 3% (30 mg THC) mixed with 1 g tobacco.
Each cigarette will be followed by 24 hours testing in laboratory conditions. Each period is separated by 7 days (3 testing periods over 3 weeks). Each volunteer will undergo performance testing (driving simulator and PVT) before administration of the substance (T0).
Blood samples and repeat performance testing will be carried out at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours.</description>
