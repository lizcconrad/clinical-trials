  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable larynx syndrome (ILS) is a hyperkinetic laryngeal dysfunction that is characterized
      by a persistent cough, voice changes, or breathing difficulties, which are often triggered by
      an irritant. Diagnosis of ILS is difficult and typically made via a thorough review of the
      clinical history and, occasionally, the patient's reaction to an odor-provocation test.
      Standard treatment for ILS is behavioural therapy with a speech language pathologist (SLP),
      which provides symptom improvement for most patients. However, currently, there are no
      objective measures of the upper airway hyper-responsiveness in this condition to assist in
      diagnosing and monitoring disease severity.

      Since the cough is irritant-based, it is anticipated that patients with ILS will have a
      hypersensitivity to the irritant capsaicin. Capsaicin is the active component of chili
      peppers and is what makes them hot. The capsaicin cough challenge is a well recognized test
      that involves inhaling different concentrations of capsaicin solutions to determine a cough
      reflex sensitivity.

      The purpose of this research study is to confirm that ILS patients have a hypersensitivity to
      capsaicin compared to healthy volunteers. If a hypersensitivity is observed in ILS patients,
      the second objective of this study will be to see if behavioural therapy improves the cough
      reflex sensitivity in this patient population.

      The proposed study has two purposes; the first is to utilize capsaicin cough challenge to
      demonstrate an increased efferent receptor sensitivity level in ILS subjects as compared to a
      control group. The second is to determine if there is an objective change in capsaicin cough
      challenge results after behavioral therapy, and whether it correlates to the subjective
      improvement. Self-reporting measures include two validated cough quality of life (QoL)
      questionnaires collected at the same intervals as the capsaicin testing.

    Logistical challenges with research pharmacy prevented the dilution of the capsaicin. No
    participants were ever recruited, enrolled, or approached.

    <description>Capsaicin cough challenge test. The ILS participants will be asked to attend two study visits at the pulmonary function laboratory at SMH; one before behavioural therapy and one after. The healthy volunteers will be asked to attend one study visit. At each of these study visits, the ILS participants will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (Appendix B) and the Dyspnea Index (DI) Questionnaire (Appendix C). The LCQ is a valid assessment tool for evaluating the impact of cough on QoL.19 The DI is a short, validated questionnaire used to quantify a patient's symptoms of dyspnea.20 Following completion of the questionnaires, participants will complete a capsaicin cough challenge test, which is discussed in the following section.</description>

    <description>The capsaicin cough challenge testing will be conducted in the pulmonary function laboratory at SMH by a pulmonary function technologist. The test involves having the participant inhale increasing concentrations of capsaicin solutions and assessing their response. The tidal breathing method and solution preparation presented by Nejla, et al. 12 will be used to conduct this testing. The tidal breathing method is preferred to the alternative dosimeter method as it produces similar results with lower capsaicin concentrations thereby resulting in less throat irritation for the participant. The technique is detailed in the following sections.</description>
