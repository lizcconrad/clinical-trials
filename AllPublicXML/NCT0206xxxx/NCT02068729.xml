      An evaluation of the incidence of complications resulting from far lateral spine surgery
      utilizing the K2M RAVINE® Lateral Access System (RAVINE) with ALEUTIAN® Lateral Interbody
      Spacer System versus literature reported results for the NuVasive XLIF® system (XLIF) in the
      treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L2-S1
      requiring surgical intervention at one or two contiguous levels. Safety will be assessed by
      the following: 1.) Evaluation of all adverse events including device related, procedure
      related and additional serious adverse events; 2.) Additional surgical intervention at the
      operative site including the need for removals, revisions, re-operations or supplemental
      fixation required to modify the device; and 3.) The incidence and severity of any psoas
      muscle injury, genital femoral nerve injury and lumbar plexus injury will be determined for
      all patients. Supplemental fixation of any kind may be included as long as the procedure is
      completed via a minimally invasive approach.

    <measure>Change in Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 8 weeks post-operatively, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a validated instrument including items that relate to subjective symptomatology and activities of daily living (pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sex life, traveling). Each item is scored from 0 up to 5, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability. A total ODI score is determined by adding the scores of the individual questions and dividing that total by the maximum possible score (i.e., 50 if all questions are answered) to yield a percentage. Therefore, the ODI score ranges from 0% to 100%. An improvement by at least 15 percentage points will be considered a success.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health-Related Quality of Life from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 8 weeks post-operatively, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be evaluated in all study subjects using the SF-12v2 Health Survey. This shortened and simplified version of the SF-36 makes the questionnaire less ambiguous for patients. It has a self-administered form that makes it easy to read and complete, and that reduces missing responses. The physical and mental component summary scales, referred to as PCS-12 and MCS-12 will be evaluated against published normative values and a 15% improvement in these scores will be used as an assessment of success. To calculate the true value of a treatment, the scores from the SF-12v2 will be converted into a utility index (SF-6D), which considers not only how many years a medical intervention can add to a patient's life, but also the quality of that life. Use of the SF-6D does not expand the questions administered to the patient.</description>
