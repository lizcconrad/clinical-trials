  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a randomized trial with patients, through one-on-one interviews,
      to evaluate their understanding of and willingness to use a decision support tool and to
      determine if receiving and discussing the decision support tool improves the likelihood that
      a patient is adherent to a new antihypertensive medication.

    <description>The proportion of patients in each group who picked up a prescription for an antihypertensive medication in any class during the follow-up period.
