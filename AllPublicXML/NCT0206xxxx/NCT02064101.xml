  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown how triggered electromyogram (EMG) pedicle screw stimulation can
      be used to effectively test correct pedicle screw placement in the lumbar and thoracic
      vertebrae. Most papers agree that if more than 6mA of current are needed to elicit a response
      the screw is correctly placed in the bone. If there is a response with less than 6mA there is
      a strong likelihood of a breach of the pedicle wall or invasion of the spinal canal.
      Typically this triggered EMG stimulation is done after all the screws have been placed with a
      ball-tipped probe and is paired with intraoperative fluoroscopy to ensure correct placement
      of the screws. Another method of testing the current for each screw is with a powered
      screwdriver, which can stimulate and give a reading as the surgeon places each screw. Both of
      these methods are currently used by surgeons, however the powered screwdriver has been found
      to be a faster method. The investigator's aim with this study is to compare these two methods
      of testing triggered EMG values. The investigators plan on doing this by testing each screw
      with both the ball-tipped probe and the powered screwdriver, in order to see if there are any
      statistically significant differences between the readings.

      The purpose of the study is to compare two methods of testing triggered EMG values. All study
      measurements will be recorded during the surgical procedure. No follow up is required with
      the patient involved and no personal health information will be recorded from the patients.

    <description>The triggered EMG value the investigators are measuring is not being evaluated with respect to the individual patient. Rather, the investigators are studying the devices themselves so once all readings are collected (which will take readings from multiple screws in multiple patients) the outcome measure will be assessed.</description>
