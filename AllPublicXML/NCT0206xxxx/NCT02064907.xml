    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      dexlansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating (OD) tablets administered on the tongue
      and swallowed without water.

      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being
      tested to see if two different forms of the medication react the same way in the human body.
      This study will look at biological samples from people who take an orally disintegrating
      tablet of dexlansoprazole compared to a swallowed capsule of dexlansoprazole.

      The study will enroll approximately 52 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups. Both treatment groups will
      receive both forms of dexlansoprazole at different time periods:

        -  Two dexlansoprazole 30 mg orally disintegrating tablets for 5 days

        -  One dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsule for 5 days.

      All participants will be asked to take two tablets or one capsule at the same time each day
      throughout each treatment period of the study.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make 3
      visits to the clinic including two 6-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 5 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

      The overall time to participate in this study is up to 57 days.
