  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we propose to determine the correlation in glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase
      enzyme activity in capillary blood obtained from a finger stick versus a venous blood
      specimen. As secondary endpoints we will seek to correlate phenotype as determined by
      quantitative and qualitative G6PD test, genotype as determined by PCR and DNA sequencing with
      flow cytometry. The secondary endpoints are critical for the design of G6PD diagnostic test
      evaluation studies.

      In this study we propose to determine the correlation in glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase
      enzyme activity in capillary blood obtained from a finger stick versus a venous blood
      specimen. We will also compare results of different G6PD tests with known G6PD genetic
      profiles. The results of the study will inform design of future G6PD diagnostic development &amp;
      evaluations. This research will be conducted in MaeSot Thailand, where G6PD deficiency has a
      high prevalence. Study participants will be recruited into three groups of 50 volunteers per
      group: 50 G6PD-deficient individuals, 50 G6PD-normal individuals, and 50 G6PD-intermediate
      individuals. Following a written informed consent, participants will donate about 3 ml of
      venous blood and about 4 drops of capillary blood (fingerstick). There will be no direct
      benefit to research participants.
