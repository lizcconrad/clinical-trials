  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localised prostate cancer can be treated by radical prostatectomy (prostate
      gland removal surgery) or radiotherapy. Around 15% of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed
      with high risk disease meaning they are more likely to suffer treatment failure, disease
      progression and mortality. To date little progress has been made towards identifying
      effective treatment strategies that might delay or prevent disease recurrence in this patient
      population. Better identification of patients at high risk of relapse and improvements in
      therapy are therefore research priorities.

      A protein named Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is known to play an important role in
      the development of prostate cancer. mTOR forms two protein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and
      sends signals helping cancer cells to grow while controlling their energy use. Blocking the
      function of mTOR, with an inhibitor such as AZD2014, might shut down the supply of energy
      supply to tumour cells leading to reduced cell growth and potentially slowing the progression
      of the disease.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular pharmacology of AZD2014 treatment
      given to patients with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy. The feasibility,
      safety and tolerability of a short course of AZD2014 will also be assessed.

      Eligible patients will be required to take 50mg AZD2014 tablets twice daily for 15 days prior
      to radical prostatectomy.

      Immunohistochemistry will be carried out on prostate tumour biopsies taken at baseline and at
      radical prostatectomy in order to detect phosphorylated biomarkers of mTOR signalling and
      determine the amount of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling inhibition caused by AZD2014 treatment.

      On the day of radical prostatectomy, blood samples will be collected pre- and at specified
      times post- dose for pharmacokinetic analyses.

      Additional blood samples will be collected to study any genetic changes to the DNA, RNA and
      circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) which may have been caused by AZD2014 treatment.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be treated with AZD2014 for 15 days prior to radical prostatectomy surgery. To assess the amount of mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition caused by AZD2014 treatment, phosphorylated signalling biomarkers (namely p4EBP1, pS6 and pAKT) will be detected by immunohistochemistry and quantified. The amount of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling inhibition will be determined by comparison of prostate tumour biopsies taken at baseline (time of diagnosis) and following AZD2014 treatment. An intra-operative prostate biopsy will also be taken in order to evaluate variability between samples.</description>

    <description>In order to assess the safety and feasibility of AZD2014 treatment prior to radical prostatectomy, a record will be kept of all adverse events experienced by the participants. Adverse events will be detailed by the study team when the participant attends inpatient/outpatient hospital visits and the participant will also be required to document their adverse events in a patient diary. Adverse events will be recorded for the duration of study treatment and for six weeks following treatment.</description>
