    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of oncolytic measles virus
      encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) infected mesenchymal stem cells and to
      see how well it works in treating patients with ovarian cancer that has come back.
      Mesenchymal stem cells may be able to carry tumor-killing substances directly to ovarian
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of an
      Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce sodium iodine symporter
      (NIS) (measles virus [MV]-NIS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, delivered by
      adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). (Phase I) II. To assess the 4 month
      progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tolerability of this regimen. (Phase II) II. To assess the response rate,
      progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
      II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and
      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS
      versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed
      tomography (CT) imaging. (Phase II) II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles
      virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration. (Phase II) III. To
      assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. (Phase II) IV. To assess
      in a preliminary fashion the development of antitumor immune response. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study.

      Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter
      intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal
      stem cells IP over 30 minutes of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
