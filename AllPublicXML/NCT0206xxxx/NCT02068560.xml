  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence that women throughout life have significantly lower plasma
      levels of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (pAVP) compared to men. The importance of this
      is not yet fully elucidated, but in relation to the observations of lower pAVP levels, no
      significant difference in renal response parameters was found. This could be interpreted an
      increased renal sensitivity in females compared to males. The theory of increased renal
      sensitivity in females is supported by a few pharmacodynamic studies currently available on
      this topic. However none of the studies was designed with the purpose of investigate the
      gender difference.

      The aim of this study is to investigate possible gender differences in the renal sensitivity
      to dDAVP and the effect of age on these differences. This will be done by low dose graded
      infusion of the synthetic AVP analog dDAVP.

      Participants are 80 healthy volunteers equally distributed between four age groups, 8-10
      years of age, 16-18 years of age, 25-40 years og age and 65+ years of age.
