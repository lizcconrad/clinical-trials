      This is an open label, dose ranging, phase1a/1b clinical trial to study the safety,
      Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Peglamda 60, 120, 180 and 240 mcg in healthy
      volunteers and antiviral activity of once weekly Peglamda administration in combination with
      daily Ribavirin in Hepatitis C naive patients up to 4 weeks period. The objective of the
      study to establish safety, PK/PD data on healthy subjects and preliminary efficacy and safety
      in Hepatitis C naive patients.
