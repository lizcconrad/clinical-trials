    <textblock>
      To assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a single dose of 14C
      labelled AZD1722 in order to define the rates and routes of elimination of AZD1722 and if
      formed, metabolites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers aged ≥50 years

          -  Regular daily bowel movements.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2 (inclusive) and weigh at least 50
             kg and no more than 110 kg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation
             in the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in
             the study.

          -  History or presence of GI, hepatic or renal disease including GI surgery other than
             appendectomy or any other condition known to interfere with the ADME of drugs.

          -  Loose stools (Bristol Stool Form Score of 6 or 7) ≥2 days in the past 7 days before
             admission to the study centre

          -  Use of medications that are known to affect stool consistency and/or GI motility,
             including fibre supplements, anti-diarrheals, prokinetic drugs, enemas, probiotic
             medications or supplements; or salt or electrolyte supplements containing sodium,
             potassium, chloride, or bicarbonate formulations during the past 7 days before
             admission to the study centre.

          -  Volunteers exposed to radiation levels above background (eg, via X-ray examination) of
             &gt;5 mSv in the last year, &gt;10 mSv over the last 5 years or a cumulative total of &gt;1 mSv
             per year of life.

          -  Participation in a previously radiolabelled study within the last 5 years
