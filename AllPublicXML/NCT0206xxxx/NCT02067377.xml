  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of a medical food, oral serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI), in helping patients with advanced COPD with cachexia (a
      wasting syndrome) improve their nutritional status and gain weight. The medical food is in
      powder form and is mixed with a liquid such as water or orange juice and consumed by
      swallowing. The primary hypothesis is that SBI protein isolate (SBI) will improve the
      nutritional status of cachexic patients with advanced stages of COPD.
