  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research over the past several decades have linked the intake of dietary fiber with lower
      blood cholesterol levels. The distinction between soluble and insoluble fiber fractions
      emerged shortly after and there is now a general consensus that soluble fiber possesses the
      capacity to lower cholesterol. Since the discovery of the cholesterol lowering effects of
      soluble dietary fiber, there has been much debate as to the degree of cholesterol reduction
      from these fibers. In order to handle the inconsistencies a full and systematic review of the
      published literature was conducted by Brown et. al (1999). Results from this meta-analysis,
      concluded that 'increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution to lowering
      cholesterol.'

      Research is constantly progressing and new research findings may not always be consistent
      with older data. For example, results from new research are now challenging the previously
      approved health claims for soy foods and fatty acids. This is a major public health concern
      because if clinical evidence is not reliable, it could lead to harm. Since the publication of
      the meta-analysis by Brown et. al (1999) over a decade ago, scientists have continued to
      research the effects of soluble fiber on cholesterol levels with new technology and trial
      designs, therefore it is crucial to revisit the question and update the literature on the
      effect of viscous soluble dietary fibers on serum cholesterol levels.

      A series of meta-analyses will be performed to assess the link between viscous dietary fibers
      and serum cholesterol levels. Nutritionists now consider fiber to be an integral part of diet
      and disease. Results from these meta-analyses help address the question of whether viscous
      soluble fibers have a role lowering serum cholesterol levels.
