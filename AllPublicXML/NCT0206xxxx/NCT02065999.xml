  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre prospective longitudinal cohort study with the aim of collecting and
      storing clinical data, patient blood, DNA and PBMCs to examine outcomes related to drug
      resistance, drug monitoring and host genetics in the era of directly acting antiviral drugs
      for hepatitis C therapy.

      1. To analyse for resistance-associated HCV variants in DAA-naïve HCV patients using
           population and ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). Resistance associated variants will be
           analysed by qualitative and quantitative methods both pre-treatment and on-treatment.

        2. To determine whether in the absence of drug pressure there is variation in the
           prevalence of naturally occurring resistance associated variants.

        3. To correlate the presence and frequency of baseline resistance-associated variants with
           the response to therapy with DAA-based triple therapy regimens for HCV.

        4. To identify predictors of emergent DAA resistance and treatment failure during therapy
           with DAA-based combination strategies, including virological, clinical and immunological
           factors.

        5. To characterize the natural history of HCV resistance associated variants that are
           selected during antiviral therapy after the withdrawal of treatment.

        6. To establish a cohort of DAA-treatment failure patients suitable for re-treatment
           studies.

        7. To establish a tissue repository of serum and PBMCs from well-characterized patients
           treated with DAA-based triple therapy to allow future examination of the role of other
           variables that may potentially impact on the outcomes of DAA based therapy and
           development of RAVs.
