  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether continuing erlotinib beyond disease
      progression in combination with chemotherapy is beneficial for NSCLC patients who have EGFR
      mutant disease or who have responded to EGFR TKI.

    <textblock>
      A Phase II randomised, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of continuing
      erlotinib in addition to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients who have EGFR
      mutant or EGFR TKI responsive NSCLC and have progressed on EGFR TKI.
