  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is currently known as to the predictive value of ultrasound in guiding the decision to
      taper drug treatment in patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis, nor the influence that
      patients' views and opinions regarding their medications may have upon this. In this study,
      patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis will undergo a simple examination of their joints
      to look for any swelling or tenderness followed by an ultrasound scan to look for joint
      inflammation. Half of the patients will also complete an interview to assess their views and
      opinions of arthritis drug treatment. The study will be completed in a single patient visit -
      no invasive tests will be performed, and no changes to treatment will be made.

      This study is being conducted as part of a Masters degree from Newcastle University. The
      results of this study will be used to inform the feasibility of inclusion of ultrasound
      assessment within the design of a future PhD study to investigate potential markers of
      remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
