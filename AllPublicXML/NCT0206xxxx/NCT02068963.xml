    <textblock>
      This non-interventional clinical study will be conducted to prospectively collect serial
      plasma and serum samples from treatment naïve subjects with chronic HCV infection who are
      initiating sofosbuvir-based therapy. These samples will be used to estimate clinical utility
      endpoints for the Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay which is used an aid in the management of
      HCV-infected patients undergoing HCV antiviral therapy.

        Treatment naïve men and women ≥18 years of age with chronic HCV infection initiating
        sofosbuvir-based treatment will be enrolled from medical facilities that may include
        private and academic family practice, infectious disease, hepatology, gastroenterology, and
        medical group clinics.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and/or 6 as
             documented in the subject's medical records and is naïve to HCV treatment (treatment
             naïve).

          -  Chronic HCV (with or without HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] co-infection) will be
             documented with historical record of:

          -  A positive HCV RNA test result (result generated at least 6 months before the baseline
             visit)

          -  A HCV genotype test result (result generated at least 6 months before the baseline
             visit)

          -  A liver biopsy report demonstrating chronic HCV

             ---The subject is initiating antiviral therapy with a sofosbuvir regimen as indicated
             below:

          -  Sofosbuvir plus peginterferon and ribavirin for 12 weeks (peginterferon eligible
             genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6)

          -  Sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks (genotype 2)

          -  Sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks (peginterferon ineligible or unwilling genotype
             1 or genotype 3)

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age at the time of enrollment

          -  Adequate medical records are available for collection of protocol-defined
             demographics, baseline patient characteristics, medical history, virology and specific
             laboratory results, and other information to verify enrollment criteria

          -  The subject and/or legally authorized representative is willing and able to provide
             consent prior to providing a specimen(s)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with history or evidence of decompensated liver disease

          -  Subjects with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease

          -  Subjects who are not naïve to HCV therapy with prior exposure to an approved or
             experimental HCV antiviral therapy

          -  Subject has characteristics that are contraindicated in the FDA approved label for
             sofosbuvir (eg, subjects with contraindications applicable to peginterferon and/or
             ribavirin, pregnant woman or men whose female partners are pregnant; Sovaldi Package
             Insert 2013)

          -  Subject is receiving treatment pre- or post-transplant

          -  Subject is unsuitable for study participation based on the Investigator's decision
             (eg, unlikely to comply with study visit schedule, significant medical complication)

          -  Participating in another investigational study that the Investigator believes might
             interfere with the subject's participation in this study
