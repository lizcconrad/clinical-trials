    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia provides adequate anesthetic conditions for many operations. These
      operations include orthopedic, urological, gynecological and many general surgery operations.
      Although few, side effects of the procedure and its effects on body are well known. However,
      there is inadequate knowledge about the effects of spinal anesthesia on pressure changes in
      the eyes. These pressure changes in eyes can result in some detriments. Elevated pressures in
      the eyes can result in disease known as glaucoma, that makes hazard to eyes. Decreased eye
      pressures can also result in some eye detriments.

      We aimed to investigate the effects of spinal anesthesia procedure on eye (intraocular)
      pressure changes.
