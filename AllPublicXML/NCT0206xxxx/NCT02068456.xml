      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of roflumilast in the
      real-use conditions with its registered indications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is used to treat
      people who have severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) forced expiratory volume
      in 1 second (FEV1) post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic
      bronchitis with a history of worsening symptoms. This study will look at side effects and the
      lung function of people who take roflumilast.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 patients who plan to take roflumilast as an add on
      to bronchiodilator treatment by their healthcare provider. This multi-centre trial will be
      conducted in Korea.. The administration period of the roflumilast is determined in accordance
      with actual treatment policy for the subject, Subjects will be evaluated during routine
      appointments with their healthcare provider.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Korea. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 1 month. Participants will be evaluated during routine appointments with their
      healthcare provider.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant regardless of causal relationship to study drug and regardless whether study drug has been administered. An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is any response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in humans. A serious AE or ADR is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to at least 1 month after administration of Roflumilast</time_frame>
    <description>After at least 1 month of administration of Roflumilast the Investigator will classify the effectiveness of treatment relative to Baseline taking into account the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2010 Guidelines using the following classification:
Improvement: if the symptom is deemed to take a turn for a better
No Change: if no particular changes are shown compared to before administration
Worsening: the symptom is worsened compared to before administration
Un-assessable: the symptom is not able to be evaluated.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation and is measured by spirometry.</description>
