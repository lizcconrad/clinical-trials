  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some studies show improvement of pain and associated effects of pain with off-label
      use of neuropathic agents for cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, there is limited published
      evidence so far. We propose to complete a year-long prospective, observational study as a
      pilot to recruit 400 patients within the year and follow their pain level, function, and QOL
      measures for 16 weeks to determine whether it is feasible to continue studying this group in
      the future. We expect that pain, function, and quality of life will be improved in the group
      of patients who are given neuropathic agents as an adjunct to other conservative treatments
      compared to the expected 65% of patients with similar symptoms who are treated conservatively
      without neuropathic agents. We do not expect a statistically significant difference between
      the two neuropathic agents.

      Since these drugs are currently used off-label, there is limited empirical evidence regarding
      which agent is more efficacious compared to the other, and since their use in treating
      radicular pain is based mostly on anecdotal evidence so far, prescription of one or the other
      of these agents has been based on likely compliance (medication needed twice a day, three
      times a day) or whether or not the patients' insurance will pay for one or the other. This
      study will be a first step to better assist practitioners in counselling their patients on
      use of these medications in radiculopathy, examining rates of discontinuation due to side
      effects and what effects these medications have on perceived pain, function and quality of
      life.
