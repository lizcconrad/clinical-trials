    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to see if Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) can be used safely and
      effectively to help treat dry eyes from ocular rosacea after chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD). Current treatment options for this disease are limited.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular rosacea and meibomian gland disease are major contributors to keratoconjunctivitis
      sicca after chronic GVHD. Rosacea exacerbates the aqueous deficiency caused by damage to
      lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands similar to cholestasis damage in the biliary system.

      Subjects who had inactive chronic GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and
      severe dry eye symptoms related to ocular rosacea were recruited and treated with 4 monthly
      sessions of IPL and meibomian gland expression. Their charts were reviewed prior to treatment
      to confirm quiescence of active systemic disease. Symptom scores were quantified with Ocular
      Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness questionnaire
      (SPEED2). Baseline complete eye exam was performed, and subjects received an eyes assessment
      score based on the Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Assessment and Scoring Form.

      Symptoms, exam, and diagnostic data were obtained at baseline (month 0, month 1, month 2,
      month 3, month 4, month 5, month 6, month 9 and month 12). IPL treatment and meibomian gland
      expression was performed at baseline (month 0), month 1, month 2, and month 3.

    <description>Participants received treatment over 4 months and were monitored for safety and response for an additional 8 months. The symptoms were scored with the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED2) questionnaire. The SPEED questionnaire presents the four most commonly experienced dry eye symptom groups and asks patients to tick a box for all symptoms that apply to them. The frequency section ratings run from 0 (never) to 3 (constant), and the severity section ratings run from 0 (no problems) to 4 (intolerable), for a total score ranging from 0 (no problem) to 28 (severe problems). Over a 30% improvement in the SPEED2 score equated a response. None of the subjects were expected to get a complete response due to the nature of the damage to their ocular surface from GVHD.</description>

            <title>IPL Treatment</title>
            <description>Subjects who had inactive chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and severe dry eye symptoms related to ocular rosacea unresponsive to conventional management were recruited. Subjects were treated with 4 monthly sessions of intense pulsed light (IPL) and meibomian gland expression.
IPL: Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatment from Quadra Q4 Platinum Series, made by DermaMed Solutions. With the eyes patched closed the IPL was applied to the surface of the skin by the way of a hand-held wand in 30 spots over the skin in the lower lid, cheek area, and nose area starting and ending from in front of each ear.
Meibomian Gland Expression: After the IPL was applied, the eyes were numbed for 15 minutes with a numbing drop, and a sterile cotton swab was used to squeeze the eyelids and express clogged oil secretions from the miebomian glands.</description>
