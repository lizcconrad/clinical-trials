  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a clinical syndrome occurring in 10 to 20% of patients admitted in ICV.
      Mortality associated to septic shock varies from 30 to 50%. It follows a systemic response of
      the organism to a severe infection, associated with a circulatory failure marker by an
      arterial hypotension and a vascular hyperactivity to vasoconstrictor agents.

      The mechanisms involved on one hand an activation of white blood cells inflammatory system
      and the vascular inflammatory system; and on the other hand on imbalance in hemostatis
      characterized by an activation of the coagulation and an inappropriate fibrinolysis leading
      to a disruption of microcirculation in the context of a disseminated intravascular
      coagulation (DIVC).

      This inflammatory and thrombotic cellular activation is strongly associated with the
      phenomenon of vesiculation; leading to the production of cellular microparticles (MP) by
      blood cells and vascular cells.

      MP are membranous vesicles, resulting in the reassortment of membrane phospholides in
      response to an activation of cellular apoptosis. They have been initially described as new
      actors of hemostatis. Indeed, the expression of phospholipid serine and tissular factor (TF)
      confer them a procoagulating activity, which increases in patients undergoing septic shock.

      The finding of a fibriniolytic activity of the cellular MP suggests the existence of
      compensating mechanisms with a procoagulating activity. This confers to MP a key-role in the
      control of the coagulolytic balance.

      Our recent researches suggest that endothelial and white blood cells MP produce in vivo
      plasmin.

      They carry into the main circulation a fibrinolytic activity which is partially beyond the
      physiological inhibitors activity (PAI-1, x 2 antiplasmin). Preliminary findings show that
      this ability of plasmin generation is important in patients affected with septic shock.

      Our hypothesis is that an increase in plasmin generation by MP compensates the risk of
      occurrence of microthrombosis, modulating therefore the vital prognosis of patients with
      septic shock.

      The coagulolytic balance of MP, which is resulting of their own procoagulating and
      fibrinolytic activities could claim the status of new pronostic marker relevant in patients
      with septic shock.

    <description>The outcome of the study is to evaluate the interest of the measure of the coagulolytic balance, dependant of the circulating MP in the prognostic of mortality in a population of subjects presenting a septic shock. The objective is to evaluate the performance of this dosage while estimating the ROC-surve.
In this present project:
• the coagulolytic balance dependant of the MP is defined by the ratio between the activity of production of thrombin of circulating MP expressed by a speed in nM thrombin per minutes : and the activity of production of plasmin of circulating MP expressed by a speed in DD per minutes measured at inclusion of the subjects ; within 48 hours after diagnosis ;</description>
