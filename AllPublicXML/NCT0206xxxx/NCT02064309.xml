  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to investigate the safety of
      implantation of the human islet containing device Beta-Air in type 1 diabetic subjects.

      The secondary objective of this clinical investigation is to investigate if the
      transplantation of macro-encapsulated human islets within the Beta-Air device can provide
      improved glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes patients with reduced incidences of
      hypoglycaemic episodes.
