    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of telotristat etiprate versus placebo on
      the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and on 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
      levels.

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug to within 30 days of last dose of study drug in the Double-Blind Treatment Period (Up to 17.1 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. A TEAE was an AE reported after the first dose of randomized treatment on Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Primary: Percent Change From Baseline in Urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (u5-HIAA) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>u5-HIAA is a standard test used in clinical practice to assess neuroendocrine tumor (NET) activity and is collected as a 24-hour urine specimen. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Open-Label Extension Period</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug to within 30 days of last dose of study drug in the Open-Label Extension Period (Up to 52.6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. A TEAE was an AE reported after the first dose of randomized treatment on Day 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Bowel Movements (BMs) Per Day Averaged Over 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number of bowel movements per day in a daily diary. The total number of BMs per day were averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Stool Form/Consistency Averaged Across All Time-Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed stool form/consistency of a BM using the Bristol Stool Form Scale where: 1=hard lumps to 7=watery liquid. The daily scores were averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Daily Cutaneous Flushing Episodes Averaged Across All Time-Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number daily flushing episodes per day in a daily diary. The total number of flushing episodes per day were averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Abdominal Pain Averaged Across All Time-Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded abdominal pain in a daily diary. Participants evaluated the level of any abdominal pain using an 11-point numeric rating scale, where: 0=no pain to 10=worst pain ever experienced. The average daily abdominal pain was averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Frequency of Rescue Short-acting, Somatostatin Analog (SSA) Used to Treat Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms Averaged Across All Time-Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency (the number of times) the participant used rescue with SSA to control symptoms was recorded in a daily diary. The daily number of rescue treatments with SSA was averaged over the 12- week period. A negative change from Baseline (less use of SSA) indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Daily BMs Averaged Over the 12-Week Double-Blind Period, Among Participants Who Were Not Receiving SSA Therapy at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number of bowel movements per day in a daily diary. The total number of BMs per day were averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Abdominal Pain Averaged Across All Time-Points</title>
          <description>Participants recorded abdominal pain in a daily diary. Participants evaluated the level of any abdominal pain using an 11-point numeric rating scale, where: 0=no pain to 10=worst pain ever experienced. The average daily abdominal pain was averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
