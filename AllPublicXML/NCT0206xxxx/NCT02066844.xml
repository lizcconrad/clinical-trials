      The purpose of this randomized, parallel-group, single-blinded, single center, Phase II study
      is to collect data to compare the comfort and patient satisfaction of a hip injection
      delivered via the Navigator compared to a standard needle injection. In addition, delivery
      preparation will be compared between a Navigator injection and a standard hip injection. The
      data collected from this pilot study will serve as the basis to design a larger multi-center
      study.
