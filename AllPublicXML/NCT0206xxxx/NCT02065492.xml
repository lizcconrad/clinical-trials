  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with thalassemia may have high iron levels after receiving blood transfusions. These
      high iron levels can have damaging effects on the body, especially the heart. Conventionally
      only chelation therapy was given for prevention of iron buildup in the heart. However,
      current research has shown that another drug, amlodipine, also helps to slow down the
      deposition of iron in the heart. This study is designed to see if patients receiving
      amlodipine along with their regular chelation therapy have a slower rate of iron buildup in
      the heart when compared with patients who are receiving chelation only.

      Null Hypothesis There is no difference between the efficacy of chelation plus amlodipine
      therapy and chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in
      thalassemia patients with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.

      Alternate Hypothesis Chelation plus amlodipine therapy is more efficacious than chelation
      therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in thalassemia patients
      with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.

      The aim of the investigators study is to determine if amlodipine, an L-type specific calcium
      channel blocker, in addition to the standard aggressive chelation therapy, can retard the
      deposition of iron in the myocardium of thalassemia patients with significant myocardial iron
      load with or without cardiomyopathy.

    <description>Each patient will be randomized into either of two study arms: amlodipine plus chelation or chelation alone. All patients will undergo MRI and T2* imaging at baseline and then at 6 and 12 month follow-up visits. Efficacy of Amlodipine will be assessed using change in T2* times.</description>

    <measure>Effect of amlodipine therapy on left ventricular size, systolic and diastolic function</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and then at 6 months and 12 months from the start of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac MRI and echocardiogram will be utilized to assess both systolic and diastolic function. Basic parameters such as left ventricular end diastolic volume, left ventricular systolic volume and the ejection fraction will be measured.
Mitral Inflow Doppler as well as Tissue Doppler Imaging will be used to assess diastolic dysfunction.
Conventional Pulsed Doppler Echocardiography will be utilized to derive the myocardial performance index (Tei Index) of each patient which will serve as a surrogate for systolic function.
Peak global and segmental longitudinal left and right ventricular strain and strain rate will be calculated using speckle tracking by tracing images obtained from the apical 4-chamber view. Peak global and segmental right and left ventricular circumferential strain and strain rate will also be calculated from a parasternal, mid-cavity short axis view using speckle tracking also.</description>

    <measure>Adverse effects of amlodipine therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months and 12 months from the start of the study; at all visits to the Clinical Trial Unit pharmacy at the Aga Khan Hosptal for dispensing amlodipine and at all routine visits to the outpatient hematology clinic</time_frame>
    <description>Data on adverse effects will be be collected using the adverse event form. The adverse effects anticipated include fatigue, nausea, edema, palpitations, flushing, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, somnolence, cough, hypertension and sinus bradycardia. Any other adverse event will also be reported. Adverse events that require only symptomatic management will be treated by the participant's primary hematologist. Adverse events that require hospitalization will also be managed by the participant's primary hematologist and the costs incurred will be covered by the research fund. Cardiovascular adverse events that require outpatient or inpatient management will be treated by the Principal Investigator and his cardiology team and all costs incurred will be covered by the research fund.</description>

Amlodipine will be administered as a single daily dose. It will be administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day or maximum of 2.5 mg/day.
Standard Chelation therapy will be administered either by subcutaneous infusion of Deferoxamine (3-5 days a week) or oral Deferasirox (daily) or combination of Deferoxamine and Deferiprone.
The dosage will depend on individual requirement, as determined by the treating hematologist.</description>
