  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients may experience long-term survival
      after allogeneic transplant (alloSCT), but disease recurrence represents the main cause of
      treatment failure. PET (positron-emission tomography) -positive patients after alloSCT have a
      dismal outcome. Serum TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) is produced by
      Reed-Sternberg cells and may be a marker of disease. Our study was aimed at assessing whether
      TARC levels after alloSCT were correlated to disease status and whether TARC monitoring could
      increase the ability to predict relapse.
