      -  To evaluate the efficacy of flexibly dosed aripiprazole in reducing serious behavioral
           problems in Asian children and adolescents with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder,
           as measured by change from baseline to endpoint on the irritability subscale of the
           aberrant behavior checklist (ABC-I).

        -  To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of flexibly dosed aripiprazole in the
           treatment of serious behavioral problems in Asian children and adolescents with a
           diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.
