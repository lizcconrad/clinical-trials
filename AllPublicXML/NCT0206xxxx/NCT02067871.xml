  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of low-level laser therapy in
           combination with neuromuscular electrical stimulation on neuromuscular (muscular
           strength and morphology) and functional parameters (pain and functional tests) in
           elderly with knee osteoarthritis.

        -  The hypothesis is that the association of low-level laser therapy with neuromuscular
           electrical stimulation could reduce joint pain associated with the inflammation and
           consequently potentiates the effects of electrical stimulation on the muscular system.

      -  Participants was randomized into one of three intervention groups (intervention period =
           8 weeks after a 4 weeks control period in all groups).

        -  Electrical stimulation group (18-32 min of pulsed current, stimulation frequency of 80Hz
           (Hertz), pulse duration of 200μs and stimulation intensity fixed near to maximal
           tolerated),

        -  Laser group (low-level laser therapy dose of 4-6J (Joules) per point, six points at the
           knee joint)

        -  Combined group (electrical stimulation and low-level laser therapy).
