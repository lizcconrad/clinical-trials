  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate selected biomarkers of tobacco exposure and biomarkers of harm and assess quality
      of life measures in smokers randomly switched from their usual brand of cigarette to one of
      three test products: (1) a tobacco-heating cigarette; (2) snus (smokeless tobacco); or (3) an
      ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarette.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, multi-center, 4-group study of health status measures and biomarkers in
      subjects who smoke and are switched to either a tobacco-heating cigarette, snus, or a
      tobacco-burning cigarette, with a non-treatment group of never-smokers.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate select biomarkers of tobacco exposure and biomarkers of harm from subjects who
           smoke and who are switched to a tobacco-heating cigarette, snus, or a tobacco-burning
           cigarette.

        -  Evaluate ability of a tobacco-heating cigarette and snus to modify patient-reported
           Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-related health status in subjects who smoke
           and are switched to either a tobacco-heating cigarette or snus relative to a control
           group (a tobacco-burning ultra-low machine yield [ULMY]) cigarette.

        -  Assess subject compliance.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Measure amount and repeatability of smoke components yielded from the cigarettes (yield
           in use) and determine relative uptake of selected smoke components.

        -  Evaluate the ability of a tobacco-heating cigarette and snus to modify general health
           status as measured by self-administered health questionnaires in subjects who smoke and
           are switched to either a tobacco-heating cigarette or snus relative to a control group
           (a tobacco-burning ULMY cigarette).

        -  Compare health status measures in smokers who are switched to a tobacco-heating
           cigarette to smokers who are switched to snus.

        -  Compare baseline data from all tobacco-using groups to baseline data from the
           never-smoking (non-treatment) group.

          -  Any acute or chronic condition that, in the Investigator(s)' opinion, limited the
             subject's ability to complete and/or participate in the study.

          -  Donation of blood from 30 days prior to Screening through Week 24 (or Study

          -  Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Study Entry.

          -  Subject or a relative of the subject was currently or had ever been employed by the

          -  Subject participated in any other investigational study drug or product trial in which
             receipt of an investigational study drug or product occurred within 30 days prior to
