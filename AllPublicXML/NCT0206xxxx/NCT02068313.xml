  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II and III studies have demonstrated IMRT to be safe and standard practice for head and
      neck cancers treated with radiotherapy. This study will be an extension to an earlier,
      in-house, trial to allow continued recording of toxicities and outcomes in patients receiving
      IMRT for head and neck cancers. This study will allow us to examine radiobiological modelling
      for normal tissue complication probability and in particular, determining the dose threshold
      for parotid glands. Our primary objective is to assess the potential effectiveness of
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in reducing xerostomia in head and neck cancer
      patients and determining threshold dose for whole parotid gland and superficial lobes of
      parotid glands
