      Octava has two versions, each with a different intend of use.

      OctavaPink is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by authorized
      clinical laboratories. The product is used for two following indications:

        -  Intend of Use #1: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed
           mammography and were determined negative for breast cancer. Being moderately sensitive
           (&gt;55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of mammography false negatives. In
           addition, being highly specific (&gt;95% specificity) it supplies additional evidence for
           true mammography negative result which will reduce examinees anxiety of being
           misdiagnosed as a result of high false negative mammography rate (10-30%)

        -  Intend of Use #2: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed
           biopsy after positive mammography and the biopsy result was negative. Being moderately
           sensitive (&gt;55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of biopsy false negatives.
           In addition being highly specific (&gt;95% specificity) it supplies an additional evidence
           for true biopsy negative result which reduces examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed.

      OctavBlue is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by EventusDx
      authorized laboratories. Intend of use of OctavBlue is the following:

      â€¢ OctavBlue is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed mammography and received
      doubtful results. Being highly sensitive (&gt;95% sensitivity) the test can help to reveal 95%
      of positive cases; and being moderately specific (&gt;55% specificity) - about half of negative
      cases. The test is not intended to be used as a standalone diagnostic technique but to supply
      additional information to a physician and help deciding about the further course of
      diagnosis.

      The primary objectives - To improve the specifications of the OctavaPink test and the
      OctavaBlue test. The current specifications being

        1. For the OctavaPink - 95% specificity and 50% sensitivity.

        2. For the OctavaBlue - 50% specificity and 95% sensitivity.

      The study will be considered as successful in any of the below options -

        1. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaPink chip will maintain specificity of at
           least 95% and increase the sensitivity to at least 85%.

        2. If the new antigens incorporated in the OctavaBlue chip will maintain sensitivity of at
           least 95% and increase the specificity to at least 85%.

        The target population will be any women with a mammography result (positive or negative).

        Women with negative mammography will be tested with the OctavaPink version to provide
        additional information to the doctors following a negative mammography.

        Women with a positive mammography will be tested with OctavaBlue version to provide
        additional information to a physician.
