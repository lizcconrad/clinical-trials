      This is a multicenter, open label, randomized bioequivalence study of BEVZ92 (bevacizumab
      biosimilar) and Avastin® with 2 parallel arms to compare the PK profile of BEVZ92 and
      Avastin® in combination with FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI chemotherapy.

      FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI will be chosen as per investigator criteria based on the hospital
      standard of care.

      Planned enrolment duration: 12 months. Pre-treatment period (included in enrolment period): 1
      month. Treatment period: Patients will continue treatment until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
