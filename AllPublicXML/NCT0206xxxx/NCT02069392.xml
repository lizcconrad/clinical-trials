  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is marked by problems in attention, memory and problem solving. These deficits
      predict long-term functional outcome such as the ability to live independently and maintain
      employment, but they are not ameliorated by currently available medications. Cognitive
      training improves these functions to some degree, but this approach is time- and
      resource-intensive. The current project aims at enhancing and accelerating the benefits that
      people with schizophrenia derive from cognitive training by administering nicotine during
      some of the training sessions. This would provide the proof of principle for a type of
      treatment intervention to improve cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

      The current project aims at determining whether the intermittent presence of nicotine during
      cognitive training exercises in people with schizophrenia will shorten the training period
      necessary to induce significant and clinically relevant improvement and enhance the
      improvement seen after a training period of specified length.

      Hypothesis 1a: Nicotine administration during training will increase the size of all measured
      effects of the training intervention, and will accelerate the time course of performance
      enhancement on the MCCB and training exercise progression parameters.

      Hypothesis 1b: The larger training effects in the Nicotine Group will persist beyond the end
      of the intervention.

      Hypothesis 2a: Within-session progress on the training exercises will be larger in the
      presence of nicotine than in the presence of placebo.

      Hypothesis 2b: These acute nicotine-induced performance elevations will persist beyond the
      presence of nicotine through subsequent non-drug training sessions, giving evidence of an
      acute facilitation of learning processes.

    <description>The MCCB is an FDA-approved assessment tool for trials of cognition-enhancing treatments in people with schizophrenia. The MCCB takes ~60 minutes to administer and is comprised of the following domains: 1) Speed of Processing; 2) Attention/Vigilance; 3) Working Memory; 4) Verbal Learning; 5) Visual Learning; 6) Reasoning and Problem Solving; and 7) Social Cognition.</description>
