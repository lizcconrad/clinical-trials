      This study assesses the efficacy and safety of two concentrations of RTA 408 Ophthalmic
      Suspension in the treatment of patients who have inflammation and pain following ocular
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following ophthalmic surgery, the current standard of care includes a topical ophthalmic
      corticosteroid or other anti-inflammatory agent to treat ocular inflammation and improve
      patient comfort. If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular
      complications including scarring, vision loss, or blindness. Although the exact dosing
      regimen is physician-dependent, patients are typically prescribed a topical corticosteroid
      for a period of 2-4 weeks following surgery, being tapered over the course of delivery as the
      inflammation subsides. Topical anti-inflammatory agents are usually administered multiple
      times per day, particularly in the early period following ophthalmic surgery. Continuing
      efforts in drug development aim to identify alternatives to ophthalmic corticosteroid use,
      due to their well-known local and systemic negative side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age of either sex or any race;

          2. Have undergone unilateral cataract extraction via phacoemulsification on the day prior
             to study enrollment/randomization;

          3. Have a grade of ≥2 in anterior chamber cell score on day after surgery (Day 1);

          4. Have a potential post-operative pin-hole visual acuity (VA) of greater than 1.0
             logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in the operative eye and fellow
             eye as measured using an Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any intraocular inflammation present in the study eye during the screening slit
             lamp examination;

          2. Have a score greater than &quot;0&quot; on the Ocular Pain Assessment at Screening in the study
             eye;

          3. Have an immunosuppressive disease or an autoimmune disease that in the opinion of the
             Investigator could affect the quality of the ocular surface;

          4. Have active or chronic/recurrent ocular or systemic disease that is uncontrolled and
             will likely affect wound healing;

          5. Have an intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤ 5 mmHg in either eye;

          6. Require the use of a contact lens or a collagen shield within 72 hours of
             investigational drug treatment or during the study period in the study eye; be
             unwilling to discontinue use of contact lenses during study period in the study eye;

          7. Require use of non-diagnostic topical ophthalmic solutions (other than perioperative
             mydriatics, anesthetics and antiseptics, prophylactic antibiotics, lid scrubs for mild
             blepharitis, or artificial tears for the management of dry eye) in the study eye for
             the duration of the study;
