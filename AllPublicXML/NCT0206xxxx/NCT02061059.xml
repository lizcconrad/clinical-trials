  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine whether the use of plantar pressure measurements in
      the production of customized therapeutic footwear for patients with diabetes and a history of
      foot ulceration results in lower production costs and more pressure relief, compared to the
      standard production. A secondary objective is to explore if a difference in durability can be
      observed in pressure reduction and development of (pre-) ulcerative lesions between the shoes
      produced with and without plantar pressure measurements.

      For each patient two pairs of shoes will be produced by two shoemakers, one using plantar
      pressure measurements and one according current standard production procedures. The patient
      will wear one of these two pairs of shoes during a period of 3 months.
