  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) therapy is a mainstay treatment for joint
      pain and painful musculoskeletal disorders. Though this form of systemic therapy is highly
      effective, it causes substantial side effects including gastritis and gastric ulcer disease,
      renal impairment, hypertension, and thrombotic events. These types of oral medications are
      utilized by millions of Americans on a fairly regular basis in both over-the-counter
      preparations and prescription compounds. In recent years, topical preparations of NSAIDs have
      been used for localized pain as an alternate to oral administration with reported good
      analgesic efficacy. For example, they are often used for knee pain. There is little systemic
      absorption of NSAIDs with topical administration, and consequently less likelihood of
      systemic side effects.

      Though much less studied than oral NSAIDs, topical NSAID preparations are currently
      prescribed for a variety of arthritic and musculoskeletal types of pain. The best-studied
      commercially available products are diclofenac 1% compounds. Higher concentrations presumably
      provide higher tissue concentration leading to better and longer pain relief, along with a
      more prominent anti-inflammatory effect.

      The investigators will therefore compare the efficacy of available topical diclofenac 1% gel
      to that of diclofenac 8% cream. Specifically, the investigators propose to test the
      hypothesis that efficacy of topical diclofenac 8% exceeds that of diclofenac 1%, without any
      increase in systemic toxicity.

      One hundred six patients presenting to the Cleveland Clinic Pain Management Department for
      the treatment of knee pain will be randomly assigned to topical diclofenac cream 8% or
      diclofenac gel 1%, with the designated medication applied the symptomatic area of the knee
      over 6 weeks. Investigators will be blinded to treatment, and will evaluate pain relief and
      functional/disability status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute and chronic knee pain, along with postoperative knee pain lasting at least two
             months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if deemed inappropriate for application of topical
             medication therapy by the treating physician. This will include adult patients with
             diffuse (non-localized) pain disorders and those likely to need knee surgery during
             the treatment period.

          -  Patients with knee infection, open knee wounds, or acute knee skin lesions will be
             excluded.

          -  Patients with diclofenac or wheat or gluten allergies will also be excluded.
