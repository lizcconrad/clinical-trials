      This pilot study is intended to assess feasibility of auricular acupuncture in NAS infants
      who require pharmacologic therapy at Tampa General Hospital (TGH). We intend to evaluate
      acceptability of auricular acupuncture, infant tolerance, recruitment strategies, and
      methodological issues. We plan to also test and generate hypotheses in preparation to apply
      for funding a larger randomized controlled trial.

      Objectives:

      Primary: To establish feasibility of a protocol for auricular acupuncture in infants
      suffering from NAS admitted to the NICU receiving pharmacologic therapy.

      Secondary: In infants suffering from NAS admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)
      receiving pharmacologic therapy:

        1. Determine parent and staff acceptability of auricular acupuncture

        2. Determine infant tolerance to auricular acupuncture

        3. Evaluate the effect of auricular acupuncture on individual items of the Modified
           Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Severity score associated with sympathetic nervous system
           responses

        4. Evaluate the effect of auricular acupuncture on time to return to birth weight
