      Validation of the patient perception questionnaire relating to CPAP use
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is designed to validate a questionnaire which aims to predict patient adherence
      to CPAP, therefore enabling the healthcare provider to better target initiatives to improve
      adherence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To predict adherence of patients on CPAP through a questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the ability of PPQ during the titration visit to predict cumulative CPAP adherence over the first 90 days of treatment usage. The PPQ questionnaire has 10 questions that ask about the patient's perception of their obstructive sleep apnea disease and their perception of the benefits of CPAP. These results were be measured against their CPAP compliance (hours/night) after 90 days of CPAP use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reliabilty of PPQ</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the stability (reliability) of the PPQ at three time points during the first 90 days of CPAP treatment usage, and does variability in PPQ scores relate to variability in CPAP usage during the same timeframe. The measure would be the relationship between the PPQ scores from the questionnaire at each time point and its association with CPAP use (hours/night)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Other factors predicting adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the impact other factors may play in predicting CPAP adherence, such as PSG variables (sleep efficacy, sleep architecture, oxygen saturation, Apnea Hypopnea Index), mask type, medical history, demographic variables such as income, education and gender.</description>
