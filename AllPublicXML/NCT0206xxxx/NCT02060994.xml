      Background: It is known that after Cesarean section is correlated with respiratory
      complication more, if done after 37-38 week of gestation than if done after 39 weeks or more.

      Goal: The aim of the current study is to find out if these respiratory complications extend
      to later life.

      Methode: Reviewing the patients' medical file, and collecting data about respiratory
      complication.

      Background: It is known that after Cesarean section is correlated with respiratory
      complication more, if done after 37-38 week of gestation than if done after 39 weeks or more.
      We have already conducted a study about this topic, and published our results.

      Goal: The aim of the current study is to find out if these respiratory complications extend
      to later life.

      Method: Reviewing the patients' medical file, and collecting data about respiratory
      complication. We will use the same patients we used at the first study. Respiratory
      complications are defined as diagnosis of asthma, treatment by inhalations or systemic
      steroids, or consultation by pulmonologist.
