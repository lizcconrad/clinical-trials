    <textblock>
      Evaluate efficacy and safety up to 36 months of titrated dose treatment with BAY85-3934
      versus epoetin alfa/beta. Titration will be based on the subject's hemoglobin (Hb) response
      and tolerability of the prior dose. Planned doses include 15, 25, 50, 75, 100,and 150 mg once
      daily.

    <description>Subjects will continue with the same treatment they were receiving in the parent study (16208). BAY85-3934 will be administered daily as oral tablets. Dose assessments will be made every 4 (± 1) weeks. At the scheduled visits, the dose may be titrated on an individualized basis taking into account the subject's Hb response and the tolerability of the previous dose. Total treatment time is up to 36 months. Planned doses include 15, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mg once daily.</description>
