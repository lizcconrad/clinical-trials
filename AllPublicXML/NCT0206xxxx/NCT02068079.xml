      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combination therapy with vemurafenib
      and trientine in patients with BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma.

      Vemurafenib is a drug that is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat adult patients with
      melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. It can
      only be used in patients whose cancer has a change (mutation) in the &quot;BRAF&quot; gene.

      Preclinical data suggests that use of a copper chelator (reducer) is a strategy to block
      cellular signaling activity which would result in anti-tumor effects (slow tumor growth).
      Trientine is a copper chelator and is FDA approved for the treatment of Wilson's disease (a
      disease of copper metabolism) and is generally well tolerated. It works by binding to copper
      to help remove it from the body. Trientine is not FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma
      and its use in this study is investigational. &quot;Investigational&quot; means the study drug is still
      being tested in research studies.

      All patients will receive vemurafenib at 960mg PO twice daily with continuous dosing in
      combination with trientine in escalating doses. The dose of trientine will depend on what
      portion of the study.

      In order to participate in the study, patients must test positive for the change (mutation)
      in the BRAF gene.

             last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
             minimized. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
             undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,

        skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an
        intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent
        pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy)
        should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

        WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
        units of HCG) within 72 hours.

        Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid
        conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of

             adjuvant setting is allowed)

          2. Any other malignancy form which the patient has been disease-free for less than 2
             years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or DCIS. Patients
             with prior malignancies that are not considered to be an active problem may be
