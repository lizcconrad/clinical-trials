  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>to determine if assay of aberrantly methylated gene markers can discriminate Barrett's Esophagus tissue (and presence of dysplasia) from esophageal squamous and gastric cardia tissue.</measure>

    <description>we will plan to identify the best markers from highly selected marker candidates to differentiate between subjects who have BE and those who do not have BE.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Controls: No endoscopic evidence of Barrett's Esophagus, able to give informed consent, 18
        years of age or older.

        Cases: At least 1 cm of visible columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia on histology
        confirmed by an expert GI pathologist (on biopsy), able to give informed consent, 18 years
        of age or older.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Controls: Patients with history of esophagectomy or mucosal ablation, gastrectomy, or known

        esophagitis LA Grade B, C, D will be excluded. Patients with prior history of colon polyps
        or colon/esophageal/gastric/pancreatic carcinoma (unless had negative colonoscopy within 2
        years to clear polyps).
