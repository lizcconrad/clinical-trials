      A research project funded by the Australian Childhood Foundation (ACF) will be conducted in
      Australian facilities of the ACF to evaluate the effectiveness of the Listening Project
      Protocol (LPP) in children with a trauma history. The LPP is designed as a &quot;neural exercise&quot;
      to reduce auditory hypersensitivities, to improve auditory processing of speech, and to
      improve behavioral state regulation. The LPP uses acoustic stimulation to exercise the neural
      regulation of the middle ear structures to rehabilitate and to normalize the acoustic
      transfer function of the middle ear structures. The current study is being conducted to
      evaluate efficacy and feasibility of the LPP and will use objective measures to evaluate
      changes in acoustic transfer function of the middle ears structures, auditory processing
      skills, physiological state regulation, and sensory symptoms.

    <description>The intervention will consist of listening to computer-altered acoustic stimulation, designed to modulate the frequency band of vocal music passed to the participant. The frequency characteristics of the acoustic stimulation are selected to emphasize the relative importance of specific frequencies in conveying the information embedded in human speech. Modulation of the acoustic energy within the frequencies of human voice, similar to an exaggerated vocal prosody, are hypothesized to recruit and modulate the neural regulation of the middle ear muscles and to functionally reduce sound hypersensitivities and improve auditory processing.</description>
