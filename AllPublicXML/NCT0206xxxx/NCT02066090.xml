      This research is planned to build a basis about the effect of acupuncture on serum metabolic
      parameters in pre-menopausal obese women with economic evaluation.

      It is consisted with two sub research.

      First, clinical research to assess the effect of acupuncture for obesity on serum metabolic
      parameters will be processed with randomized, patient-assessor blinding, and sham-acupuncture
      controlled study design. 120 subjects would be collected and divided into two
      groups(experimental and placebo, 60 subjects each). Experimental group will undergo with real
      acupuncture treatment(manual acupuncture + electroacupuncture) twice a week, for 6 weeks. The
      effect on serum metabolic parameters will be assessed at 0 and 6 weeks.

      Second is qualitative research to make a basis through the evaluation of economic efficacy
      and patients' satisfaction with acupuncture treatment for obesity.
