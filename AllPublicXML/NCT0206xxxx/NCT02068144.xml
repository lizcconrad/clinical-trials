      The purpose of this study is to determine the health benefits of cranberry extract in people
      who are at risk for diabetes and heart problems.

      This study will be a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study in which
      subjects with pre-diabetes will be randomized to receive either placebo or Cranberry extract
      for a total of 8 weeks of treatment. Each subject will continue on the same dosage of
      cranberry extract or matching placebo for the entire duration of treatment. Comparisons for
      insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and markers of inflmmation and oxidative stress
      will be made between the 2 groups pre and post intervention.
