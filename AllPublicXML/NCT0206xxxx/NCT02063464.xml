  <brief_summary>

      Background:

        -  Monocytes are a type of white blood cell found in human blood. They help the immune
           system. Researchers have found that monocytes taken from the blood of healthy people can
           kill tumor cells. Now they want to know if monocytes taken from the blood of people with
           ovarian cancer can kill tumor cells.

        -  In addition, native host anti-tumor cell mediated immune mechanisms may play a role in
           clinical outcome of epithelial ovarian cancer; data indicate that the presence of
           intra-tumoral CD3+ T-cells was shown to prognosticate improved outcome in advanced
           ovarian cancer. Furthermore, non-cellular components in the blood, such as exosomes, may
           influence outcome.

      Objective:

      - To see if monocytes taken from the blood of people with ovarian cancer can kill tumor
      cells.

      Eligibility:

      - Women 18 years and older with ovarian cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history and physical exam.

        -  Blood tests.

        -  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and/or an MRI. For these scans, they will lie
           in a machine that takes pictures of their body.

        -  A small amount of blood (two tubes) will be collected by needle during one visit.

      Background:

      Using both in vitro and in vivo assays we have shown that human monocytes primed with
      Interferons alpha and gamma are tumoricidal and are capable of killing a number of tumor cell
      lines and human tumors implanted into immunocompromised mice. We have shown that monocytes
      isolated through elutriation at the NIH blood bank and monocytes isolated from anticoagulated
      peripheral blood from healthy women from the NIH blood bank are equally capable of killing
      tumor cells. No data have been collected as to whether monocytes from patients with Ovarian,
      Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer have tumoricidal properties. In addition, native
      host anti-tumor cell mediated immune mechanisms may play a role in clinical outcome of
      epithelial ovarian cancer; data indicate that the presence of intra-tumoral CD3+ T-cells was
      shown to prognosticate improved outcome in advanced ovarian cancer. Furthermore, noncellular
      components in the blood, such as exosomes, may influence outcome.

      Objectives:

      To obtain blood samples from patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Females greater than or equal to 18 years of age with a prior diagnosis of ovarian, primary
      peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer seen in the Women s Cancer Clinic of the NCI. Patients
      must be able and willing to provide informed consent.

      Design:

      We will collect approximately 20 ml of peripheral blood at a single time point from patients
      with ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who are not currently on therapy
      and are screening for trials, being seen in consultation, or presenting for enrollment on a
      clinical trial.
