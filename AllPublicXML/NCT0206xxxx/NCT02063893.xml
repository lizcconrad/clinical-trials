  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors
      into immunosuppressed mice, preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and
      effects of CSCs. In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced
      by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinctmurine tumors after their inoculation
      into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic and more
      effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective antitumor
      immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which bound to
      CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were capable of
      killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed antibodies and
      T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor immunity.

      To assess the feasibility of generating CSC-loaded DC vaccines for clinical use, the
      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with Breast
      Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the
      Breast Cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
      tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the Breast Cancer patient using a similar protocol as
      investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-Breast Cancer CSC immunity
      induced by Breast Cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of Breast Cancer CSCs by antibodies
      produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with Breast Cancer CSC-DC.
