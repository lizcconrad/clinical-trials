             including Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor, Pravachol, Lescol, Livalo) without problems, and
             would be willing to withdraw from statin for the duration of the trial (4 weeks
             without statin prior to randomization for washout period, then treatment with protocol

          -  History of significant cardiovascular or coronary heart disease (CVD or CHD) as
