  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies whether auranofin will relieve pain following
      paclitaxel in patients who have previously experienced paclitaxel-induced pain. Auranofin is
      a drug given by mouth to treat other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is being
      studied to see if it will decrease pain following paclitaxel.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether one dose of auranofin given the day following administration of
      paclitaxel decreases pain as assessed by daily completion of the Modified Brief Pain
      Inventory scale for seven days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess whether auranofin is well tolerated in this setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) on day 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on day 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 21-28 days.

    <description>The per arm percentage of patients who report having experienced the PIAPS for one week after paclitaxel after enrollment to the current trial will be assessed based on the response to the question &quot;Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours&quot;.
