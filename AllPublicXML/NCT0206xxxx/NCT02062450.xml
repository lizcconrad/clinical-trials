      The PURPOSE of this study is to demonstrate the performance and reliability of the Tornier
      &quot;Dual Mobility Cup&quot; used during primary total hip replacement or hip replacement revision
      surgery at a minimum of 24 months post-implantation. The primary endpoint is to determine the
      dislocation rate observed during post-surgical follow-up. The secondary endpoints are to
      assess, in the short-term, the following: clinical performance on the basis of clinical
      scores and hip mobility; radiological performance, particularly in terms of positioning and
      fixation of the implant; as well as the reliability of the implantation of this acetabular
      cup on the basis of any complications observed

    <measure>Clinical Performance - PMA Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postel-Merle-d'Aubigné (PMA) score is known since 1954 and is a very widespread mean of evaluating the clinical function of the hip by the physician.
It contains three items: pain, function and hip mobility, each noted on 6 points (0 is the worst possible score and 18 is the best possible score) :
a score between 15 and 18 points is defined as good,
a score between 12 and 14 points is defined as average,
a score inferior to 12 is defined as bad</description>

    <measure>Clinical Performance - HOOS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS (Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) is a patient questionnaire evaluating patients' feelings about their operated hip. It consists of 40 questions divided into 5 subgroups: pain, symptoms, daily living, quality of life, sports and recreational activities. Each category is scored on 100 points, 0 being the worse outcome and 100 the best outcome.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Performance - HARRIS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2-year postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The HARRIS score is a physician questionnaire assessing hip pain, function and mobility on a total of 100 points, 100 being the maximum score. A result between 90 and 100 points is considered &quot;excellent&quot;, between 80 and 90 &quot;good&quot;, between 70 and 80 &quot;mediocre&quot; and less than 70 &quot;poor&quot;.</description>

        <description>Postel-Merle-d'Aubigné (PMA) score is known since 1954 and is a very widespread mean of evaluating the clinical function of the hip by the physician.
It contains three items: pain, function and hip mobility, each noted on 6 points (0 is the worst possible score and 18 is the best possible score) :
a score between 15 and 18 points is defined as good,
a score between 12 and 14 points is defined as average,
a score inferior to 12 is defined as bad</description>
