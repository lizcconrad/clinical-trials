  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the present study had two main aims. First, due to the current underconsumption of dental
      brush adolescents, the investigators should apply a volitional intervention to increase oral
      health behvaiour in adolescents. Second, the investigators aim to compare the effectiveness
      of action planning intervention and implementation intention will improve oral health
      behavior in adolescents.

    <description>It may be helpful for you to plan when and where you will brush your teeth each day over the next month. Please write below when, where, and after what activity you will brush your teeth (e.g., at 8.00 a.m. and 9.00 p.m. in the bathroom after eating breakfast/dinner). Because you should brush your teeth twice a day, please make two plans.
