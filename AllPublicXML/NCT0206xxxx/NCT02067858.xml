  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this clinical research are to evaluate the outcomes and tumor response for early
      stage non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
      (SBRT) using four dimensional (4D) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography
      (CT), Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), Real-Time Position Management (RPM™) and body
      immobilization system (see figure 1). Specifically, the effect of image-guided SBRT treatment
      on clinical tumor response rate, local control and progression-free survival will be studied.
      This study will examine target volumes and relevant margins determined by an assessment using
      4D PET and repeated 4D CT. These data will allow us to evaluate and determine the impact of
      the body immobilization system on the planning target volume (PTV) margins, patient's
      breathing pattern, target motion, and inter-treatment targets shifts.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The patient must be over the age of 18 years. Histologic confirmation of primary NSCLC of
        the lung tumor must be complete prior to SBRT treatment.

        The following stages of NSCLC patients would be eligible for the study:

        Stage I:

        T1 N0 M0 T2 N0 M0 (Size ≤ 5 cm)

        Stage II:

        T3 N0 M0 (Chest wall invasion only, Size ≤ 5 cm)

        Staging Tumor size and characteristics: they will be determined by PET-CT scan

        Nodal disease:

        Patients with chest CT scan demonstrating hilar or mediastinal nodes &lt;1cm and/or PET
        negative would be considered N0 disease.

        Patients who have hilar or mediastinal nodes &gt; 1 cm and PET scan negative may be considered
        N0 disease.

        If PET scan demonstrates suspicious uptake or abnormal uptake, these patients would be
        eligible, if a directed biopsy (by mediastinoscopy, Chamberlein procedure or other
        modalities such as trans-bronchial biopsy, CT guided biopsy) is negative.

        Metastases:

        Evaluated by PET-CT scanning and biopsy as indicated

        The patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2. In order to be
        considered medically-inoperable, the patient must meet at least one major criterion or meet
        a minimum of 2 minor criteria as described below.

        MAJOR CRITERIA:

        FEV1 &lt; 50% or predicted postoperative FEV1 &lt; 40% DLCO &lt; 50% or predicted postoperative DLCO
        &lt; 40% Exercise induced maximal exercise oxygen consumption (MVO2)&lt;15 ml/kg/min Thoracic
        surgery consultation should be obtained from a Board Certified Thoracic surgeon who in
        collaboration with a radiation oncologist should determine if the patient is medically
        operable This criterion would be mandatory

        protected Health information.

        Conditions for Patient Ineligibility The patient's weight exceeds the tolerances of the
