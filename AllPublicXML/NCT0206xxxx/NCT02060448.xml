  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to begin establishing an effective treatment for individuals
      who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as there are currently no evidence-based
      treatments that directly target this problematic behavior. Existing treatments that have
      demonstrated initial promise in reducing NSSI consist of many skills embedded in complex
      programs; therefore, the skill(s) responsible for improvements in NSSI are not clear.
      Procedures that focus on one's emotions, particularly that aim to increase emotional
      awareness and engagement in cognitive reappraisal (i.e., a way of thinking that lessens
      emotions), may be critical in effective NSSI treatment. The specific goals of this study are
      to investigate the effects of two specific emotion-focused treatment elements on NSSI.
      Participants will be ten individuals who meet the proposed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      for Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association) criteria for NSSI
      disorder and engage in NSSI to reduce or escape from negative emotions. Two core modules of
      the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP; Barlow et al.,
      2011) will be adapted and delivered with the aim of reducing participants' non-suicidal
      self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Each treatment module will consist of four 50-minute
      individual weekly sessions of emotion awareness training or cognitive reappraisal. The study
      will use a single-case experimental design, and phase change will be determined based on each
      participant's changes in non-suicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors.

    <description>Participants in this arm will first undergo a two-week baseline phase. Participants who evidence a significant decrease in non-suicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, or SITBs, (i.e., &quot;responders&quot;) after emotion awareness training will go straight to a four-week follow-up, and not receive cognitive reappraisal. Participants who evidence a less than satisfactory response in non-suicidal SITBs (i.e., &quot;partial responders&quot;) after emotion awareness training will return to a two-week baseline phase before receiving cognitive reappraisal, and then enter a four-week follow-up. Participants who evidence little to no response in non-suicidal SITBs (i.e., &quot;non-responders&quot;) after emotion awareness training will immediately receive cognitive reappraisal and then enter a four-week follow-up.</description>

          -  Unwilling to refrain from initiating additional treatment during the course of the
             study

          -  Current or very recent symptoms that warrant immediate clinical attention, alternative
             treatment, and/or a higher level of care that cannot be provided through the study
             (e.g., florid delusions or hallucinations, rapid mood state, severe manic symptoms)

          -  Current or recent (within 3 months) history of substance use disorder (exception would
             be marijuana, caffeine, nicotine)

          -  Emotional symptomatology is due to a medical/physical condition
