      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the effects of taking doxepin hydrochloride as
      compared to placebo (inactive drug) in treating esophageal pain in patients with cancer
      located in the chest area receiving radiation therapy to the thorax with or without
      chemotherapy. Doxepin hydrochloride is a tricyclic antidepressant drug which was recently
      shown to be helpful for mouth pain in patients receiving radiation therapy. Doxepin
      hydrochloride affects the surface of the esophagus, which may be helpful in reducing the pain
      caused by radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide baseline data regarding the effectiveness of doxepin (doxepin hydrochloride) in
      reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) to the
      thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes,
      1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours on day 1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the adverse event profile of doxepin swish and swallow using a patient-reported
      questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours using
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
      (RTOG) acute toxicity criteria, and also for domains of unpleasant taste, burning/stinging
      discomfort, and drowsiness.

      II. To evaluate the effectiveness of doxepin in reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients
      undergoing RT to the thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15
      minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hours and then at 2 and 4 hours on days 1 and 3 (including the
      cross-over phase).

      III. To compare and provide baseline data regarding alternative analgesic use between the
      doxepin and placebo arms.

      IV. To provide baseline data regarding the patients? preference for continued therapy with
      doxepin or placebo after initial test dose or after the cross-over phase, as measured by
      items 9 and 10 in the patient-reported questionnaire at 4 hours after administration of the
      study medication and the actual participation rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pain reduction and other adverse event profile in the optional continuation
      phase of doxepin oral rinse therapy. (Only applies to patients who have the optional
      continuation of doxepin oral rinse after the first two phases)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds,
      and slowly swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm II on day 3.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds, and slowly
      swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm I on day 3.

      In both arms, patients may continue to receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution every 4
      hours as needed during radiation therapy.

    <description>Patients will assess their pain at baseline and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after treatment. The area under the curve of these 6 time points will be adjusted by their baseline pain score and compared between groups. The primary endpoint will be based on the area under the curve values only in the first period before the crossover. This difference between groups will be tested using a one-sided t-test with a 10% type I error rate.</description>
