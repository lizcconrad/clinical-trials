    <textblock>
      Subjects will perform experiments in an at home-setting. The effect of caffeine in coffee
      will be tested in subjects with computer tests on attention and alertness. Comparison of the
      results with published results from controlled experiments will indicate the effectiveness of
      home experiments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing interest in the general public in measuring health parameters at home,
      instead of in a medical setting. Many tests for measuring health parameters are commonly
      available in drug stores as well as online. When structured, this trend may also be used for
      performing a randomized intervention trial.

      The current study is aimed to evaluate the procedure of performing a non invasive
      intervention study by subjects themselves performing the tests at home.

      The study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study.

      Subjects have to consume a cup of coffee after an overnight fast. Coffee will be prepared
      from instant coffee containing either regular coffee or decaff coffee. Each intervention will
      be given twice.

      Effects on alertness and attention will be established by three computerized tests provided
      by Quantified Mind. The tests will be performed by the subjects at t=0 (baseline, prior to
      coffee consumption) and t=1h, one hour after coffee consumption, in one go. Each test will be
      performed during 5 minutes. During the training session the participants will be instructed
      to get acquainted with the task.

      The evaluation of the study concerns the effect of caffeine in the at home setting versus
      published results, as well as reproducibility of the results.

This evaluation will partly depend upon the actual number of subjects completing the tests in this at home set-up.</description>
