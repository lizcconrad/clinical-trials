  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous study demonstrated that the condition of central cholinergic nerve is important for
      the postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In present study investigators hypothesized that the
      acetylcholine concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is associated to the postoperative
      cognitive changes in aged patients undergoing osteopathic surgery.
