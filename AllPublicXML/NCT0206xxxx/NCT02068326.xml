  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although it is now possible to diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in
      adolescents younger than 18 years according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V), and studies indicates that BPD can be reliably
      diagnosed in adolescence, only a few evidence based treatment programmes for adolescent BPD
      exists. Mentalization-based treatment (MBT), including group psychotherapy, has repeatedly
      shown to be effective in treating adult BPD, but in the case of adolescents, only individual
      MBT have been tested and found to be effective.

      Aims/hypotheses: We will test whether group based MBT (MBT-G), including an introductory
      programme for patients (MBT-I) and their parents (MBT-P) is more effective than Treatment As
      Usual (TAU) in treating adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD.

      Methods/Design: 112 patients referred to child and adolescent psychiatric clinics in Region
      Zealand will be randomized to either MBT or TAU. Inclusion criteria: Meeting DSM-V
      BPD-criteria at the threshold (five criteria) or sub threshold level (4 criteria). Follow-up
      will be at three and 12 months.

      Discussion: Early intervention is especially important in relation to personality
      psychopathology and has long-term benefits for patients, their families and society. In
      addition to being cost effective, using the group modality in the treatment of BPD may have
      several advantages. This is the first Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the
      effectiveness of MBT in groups for adolescents.

    <description>the experimental intervention is a year-long manualized program that comprises four components:
Five individual case-formulation sessions,
MBT-I, an introductory pedagogical program for patients (three weekly sessions)
MBT-G, MBT-program in groups (37 weekly sessions)
MBT-P, a psychoeducation program for the patients' parents or parents substitutes (six sessions).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group will receive Treatment As Usual (TAU). TAU is defined as comprising at least 12 monthly individual supportive sessions provided by non-MBT trained mental health professionals in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Region Zealand. Additional supportive sessions or other types of intervention may be offered to the patients according to the needs of the patients as evaluated by mental health professionals responsible for his/hers treatment. Hence, TAU may vary considerably in number and type of intervention across clinics and patients. All mental health services delivered during the treatment period to patients in the TAU group will be monitored and registered.</description>
