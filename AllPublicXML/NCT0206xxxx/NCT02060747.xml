    <textblock>
      Harrington's metaphorical depiction captures the essence of the problem : &quot;Osteoporosis care
      of fracture patients has been characterized as the Bermuda Triangle made up of orthopaedists,
      primary care physicians and osteoporosis experts into which the fracture patient disappears&quot;.

      The most effective way to achieve this goal is through implementation of coordinator-based
      post fracture models of care. Exemplar models have been refered to as &quot;Fracture Liaison
      Service&quot; (United-Kingdom [1-3], Europe [4,5] and Australia [6-8]) &quot;Osteoporosis Coordinator
      Program&quot; (Canada [9,10]) or &quot;Care Manager Programs&quot; (USA [11,12]).

      The objective of this trial is to assess efficacy of a new coordinator-based post-fracture
      program in the Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris to improve the management of osteoporosis after
      fracture thanks to an optimal recommendations practice to reduce the incidence of secondary
      fractures.

      Men and women are included aged over 45 years with fragility wrist and hip fractures.

      Evaluation criteria are based on the evidence-based assessment (stratify risk, identify
      secondary causes of osteoporosis, fracture evaluation), the medication adherence, others
      prescriptions adherence (osteodensitometry), the incidence of secondary fractures and number
      of falls.

    <description>This outcome is a composite outcome wich differ with each fracture type. It will be assess 6 months after patient inclusion.
An adequate management care is defined for each fracture as below.
For wrist fracture: medical visit at J15, osteodensitometry, therapeutic decision if necessary (if not, reasons have to be precised in medical sheet).
For hip fracture: osteodensitometry if necessary, therapeutic (chronic care) decision if necessary (if not, reasons have to be precised in medical sheet).</description>
