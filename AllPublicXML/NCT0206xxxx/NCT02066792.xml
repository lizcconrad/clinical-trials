  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of 50 mg of d-cycloserine in comparison
      to placebo (a pill containing no medication) for improving the effectiveness of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing symptoms associated with social anxiety
      disorder. In addition, the study will examine whether the effectiveness of d-cycloserine
      depends on the timing of the pill administration (i.e., 1- hour before the session or
      immediately after the session) as well as the success of the CBT therapy sessions. The
      investigators hypothesize that the tailored post-session DCS administration condition will
      outperform the other conditions (pre-session DCS, placebo, and non-tailored post-session
      DCS). This will be evidenced by short- and long-term improvements in social anxiety severity.

    <description>Social anxiety severity will be assessed at baseline and each of the weekly sessions (including the post-treatment and follow-up visits).

    <description>This will be a 5-session version of a group CBT protocol with 4-6 patients and 2 therapists per group emphasizing repeated exposure practices. Session 1 involves an introduction and orientation to the CBT model. Sessions 2-5 emphasize repeated exposure tasks, which consist of role-play activities to confront fearful situations in a group setting while disputing cognitive distortions (coupled with the fading of safety behaviors). At the conclusion of each exposure session, patients will be encouraged to continue to apply home-practice strategies (such as giving speeches in front of a mirror). Continued practice of the interventions will be considered part of treatment, and patients will be asked to refrain from alternative treatment for four weeks following completion of the last treatment session.</description>

             anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-5 criteria.

          -  A total score &gt; 60 on the LSAS.

          -  Physical examination and laboratory findings without clinically significant
             abnormalities.

          -  Willingness and ability to participate in the informed consent process and comply with
             the requirements of the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, delusional disorders
             or obsessive-compulsive disorder; an eating disorder in the past 6 months; organic
             brain syndrome, mental retardation or other cognitive dysfunction that could interfere
             with capacity to engage in therapy; a history of substance or alcohol abuse or
             dependence (other than nicotine) in the last 6 months or otherwise unable to commit to
             refraining from alcohol use during the acute period of study participation.

          -  PTSD within the past 6 months. Entry of patients with other mood or anxiety disorders
             will be permitted if the SAD is judged to be the predominant disorder, in order to
             increase accrual of a clinically relevant sample. Patients with significant suicidal
             ideation (MADRS item 10 score &gt; 3) or who have enacted suicidal behaviors within 6
             months prior to intake will be excluded from study participation and referred for
             appropriate clinical intervention.

          -  Patients must be off concurrent psychotropic medication (e.g., antidepressants,
             anxiolytics, beta blockers) for at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of randomized
             treatment.

          -  Significant personality dysfunction likely to interfere with study participation.

          -  Pregnant women, lactating women, and women of childbearing potential who are not using
             medically accepted forms of contraception (e.g., IUD, oral contraceptives, barrier
             devices, condoms and foam, or implanted progesterone rods stabilized for at least 3
             months).

          -  Any concurrent psychotherapy initiated within 3 months of baseline, or ongoing
             psychotherapy of any duration directed specifically toward treatment of the SAD is
             excluded. Prohibited psychotherapy includes CBT or psychodynamic therapy focusing on
             exploring specific, dynamic causes of the phobic symptomatology and providing
             management skills. General supportive therapy initiated &gt; 3 months prior is
             acceptable.

          -  Prior non-response to adequately-delivered exposure (i.e., as defined by the patient's
             report of receiving specific and regular exposure assignments as part of a previous
             treatment).

          -  Patients with a history of head trauma causing loss of consciousness, seizure or
             ongoing cognitive impairment. Current use of isoniazid or ethionamide compounds

          -  Insufficient command of the English language
