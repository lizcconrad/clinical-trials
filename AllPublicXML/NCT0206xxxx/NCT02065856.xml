      This trial is an open, national, multi-centre trial. The trial will be initiated in December
      2013 and subjects will receive treatment for 6 weeks.

      Safety monitoring will be performed in an ongoing basis through a Clinical Safety Group with
      immediate access to Adverse Events registered in the clinical database. The composition,
      procedures and deliverables of the Clinical Safety Group will be detailed in a Safety
      Agreement prior to trial start.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical history of Salsola kali pollen induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or
             without asthma at least one year prior to trial entry.

          -  Positive Skin Prick Test to Salsola kali pollen (wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm).

          -  Documenting in the last 5 years a positive specific Immunoglobulin E against Salsola
             kali pollen (≥ Class 2; ≥0.70 KU/L).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Forced expiratory volume at one second 1 &lt; 70% of predicted value at screening after
             adequate pharmacologic treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe asthma.

          -  History of severe asthma exacerbation or emergency room visit or admission for asthma
             in the previous 12 months.

          -  At screening, current symptoms of, or treatment for, upper respiratory tract
             infection, acute sinusitis, acute otitis media or other relevant infection (serous
             otitis media is not an exclusion criterion).

          -  Treatment with parenteral corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids or anti-IgE in the
             previous 3 months or during the study (except for steroids if needed as rescue
             medication).

          -  Currently treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, tricyclic
             antidepressants, β-blockers, mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and any other drug
             containing alum (e.g. antacids) taken on a daily basis.

          -  Immunotherapy with Cupressus arizonica or Salsola kali pollen extracts within the
             previous 5 years (initiation of subcutaneous immunotherapy is acceptable if treatment
             has been discontinued before reaching maintenance dose; for SLIT 3 months in the last
             5 years is accepted) or concomitant immunotherapy with any other allergen.

          -  History of anaphylactic shock due to e.g. food, insect venom, exercise or drug.

          -  History of severe and recurrent angioedema.
