  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pattern of flavoring and drinking of
      laxatives for colonoscopy can improve the experience of patients when they are undergoing
      bowel preparation for the test.

      Investigators hypothesize that patients will have a better experience if patients taste the
      bowel preparation laxative with and without flavoring and then decide how they want to drink
      the rest of the laxative since taste preferences vary widely from person to person.

    <measure>Overall patients' experience with the bowel preparation process with ratings from 1 (unbearable) to 10 (Pleasant)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>On the day of the patient's colonoscopy, each patient will complete another form regarding their bowel preparation experience. Information gathered will include their ratings of the bowel preparation laxative's taste, ease of consumption, presence or absence of nausea, vomiting, whether they consumed the entire recommended laxative and their overall ratings of the bowel preparation experience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopist ratings of the patient's bowel preparation quality using Aronchick scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>During the colonoscopy, the endoscopist who will be masked to the assignment of the patients will assess the quality of bowel preparation and grade as Poor/Inadequate, Fair, Good, Very Good or Excellent.</description>

    <description>The patient will mix 1 gallon of polyethylene glycol with water. Fill 2 cups with the solution. The patient will add flavoring to one cup and drink both the flavored and unflavored solutions in the cups. The patient will then determine how he/she wants to drink the rest of the bowel preparation laxatives based on their taste preference and drink at the time specified by his/her endoscopist.</description>
