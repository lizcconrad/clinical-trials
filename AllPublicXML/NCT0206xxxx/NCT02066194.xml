  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved to become an important diagnostic tool and its
      interventional role is rapidly expanding. In order to improve patient's comfort and
      satisfaction during and after procedure, the use of sedation is usually recommended. However,
      sedation may be associated with serious adverse events of including hypotension, aspiration
      and respiratory depression. Moreover, the cost of performing the procedure would be increased
      due to the costs of the medications and the need of additional personnel in monitoring of the
      patient. As a result, the drive to seek alternative and safer approaches of pain-relief
      during EUS is ever present. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used in Traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM) for more than 2000 years. The benefits and success of EA in treatment of acute
      and chronic pain of various origins have been well-recognised. Many researches have been
      performed to address the role of EA in treating pain and anxiety during OGD and colonoscopy.
      However, only limited data is availabe in the Chinese and the Western literature concerning
      the use of EA in EUS. Therefore it is worthwhile to conduct a well-designed study to evaluate
      the role of EA in treating pain during EUS.

    <description>Patients randomized to the experimental group will receive EA at acupoints relevant to the treatment of abdominal pain and anxiety. Selection of these acupoints is based on a consensus between the acupuncturist of the study (Leung WW) and several professors of the Diploma Course of Clinical Acupuncture of the School of Professional and Continuing Education, University of Hong Kong.</description>
