      Protocol 13VR3 is is a multi-center, open-label study assessing long-term somavaratan
      administration.

      Patients will be monitored for safety throughout their participation in the study. Safety
      will be monitored by physical examination, inspection of injection sites, vital signs,
      clinical laboratory determinations (including fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids), 12-lead
      ECGs (for new treatment naïve subjects and subjects not previously exposed to somavaratan),
      PK/PD assessments, and immunogenicity assessments.

      Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be captured. AEs will be coded using
      CTCAE v 4.0. AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and CMs using the WHO Drug
      dictionary.

      Protocol 13VR3 is a multi-center, open-label study assessing long-term somavaratan
      administration. It is open to subjects completing a somavaratan study in children with growth
      hormone deficiency (GHD), as well as up to 100 new treatment naïve subjects with GHD. All
      subjects will receive somavaratan 3.5 mg/kg twice monthly. The study will be conducted at
      approximately 70 Pediatric Endocrinology centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
