  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the availability of the PDE10A enzyme in Huntington
      disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs) using the recently developed radioligand
      [18F]MNI-659. The study will be cross-sectional, examining HDGECs at different stages of the
      disease (pre-manifest, stage 1 and stage 2), in comparison with Healthy Controls (HCs). The
      HDGECs included in this study will be recruited from the large database of the REGISTRY
      (NCT01590589) or ENROLL-HD (NCT01574053) studies.

      The study will be organized in an &quot;adaptive-like&quot; mode. Initially a cohort of 5 HDGECs and 5
      HCs will be studied. The data obtained in the first cohort will be analysed and depending on
      the variability of the data, there will be approximately 10 HDGECs and an equal number of HCs
      in the second cohort and the size of the third cohort may be altered to in total include
      approximately 45 HDGECs and an equal number of HCs.

    <description>All subjects (both HDGECs and HCs) will receive single intravenous doses of the radioligands [11C]raclopride (non-investigational medicinal product [NIMP]) and [18F]MNI-659 (investigational medicinal product [IMP]).
The radioligands [11C]raclopride and [18F]MNI-659 will be administered at doses less than 10 micrograms, i.e. within the micro dosing concept, and no pharmacological effects are expected.
The injected radioactivity of [11C]raclopride will be 300 MBq/70 kg of body weight ± 10%.
The injected radioactivity of [18F]MNI-659 will be 185 MBq/70 kg of body weight ± 10%.</description>
