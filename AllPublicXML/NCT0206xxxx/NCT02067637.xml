    <textblock>
      Hypotheses and Specific Aims: There is limited data on the long-term consequences of cancer
      therapy on young, reproductively aged cancer survivors. The investigators objective is to
      characterize some of these effects in the cancer population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To compare markers of ovarian reserve between cancer survivors and healthy
      controls.

      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors will have lower serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) and antral
      follicle count (AFC), and higher Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) than healthy controls.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare cardio-metabolic, endocrine and bone profiles between cancer
      survivors and controls using a combination of anthropometric measures, fasting serum markers,
      and urinary markers of bone health.

      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors will have higher total cholesterol and lower 25-OH vitamin D
      than healthy controls.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate potential associations between ovarian reserve and markers of
      metabolism, obesity, and tumor bone health in young female cancer survivors.

      Hypothesis: As BMI and total cholesterol increases, serum AMH will decrease.

      Specific Aim 4: To compare quality of life markers, as assessed by validated instruments,
      between cancer survivors and controls using recommended scoring techniques.

      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors will have lower quality of life markers as compared to controls.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective study to characterize the quality of life and
      cardio-metabolic, endocrine, and bone profiles of female cancer survivors using a combination
      of anthropometric, serum, urinary, and ultrasonographic markers in combination with QOL
      instruments.
