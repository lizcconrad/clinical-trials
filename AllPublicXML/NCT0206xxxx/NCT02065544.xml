  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the effects of weight loss and exercise training on glucose control as
      measured by the Hemoglobin A 1 C in individuals with recently diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes.
      Study outcomes are measured at 6 months. The primary outcome is the HBA1c at 6-months.
      Secondary outcomes include body weight, fitness, lipid profiles and HS-CRP, a measure of
      inflammation. The study hypothesis is that the program of weight loss and exercise will put
      &gt;50% of individuals into &quot;remission&quot; of their type 2 Diabetes as measured by a HBA1c of &lt;
      6.5%.

      6.5%.

      The study replicates the clinical situation where selected patients with new type 2 diabetes,
      who are motivated to try an intensive lifestyle intervention, might replicate our study
      intervention if we are able to show a high remission rate (e.g. &gt; 50%) for individuals in the
      study.
