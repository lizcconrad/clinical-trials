    <textblock>
      Opioids are an effective instrument for patients with acute and chronic pain. Their route of
      administration ranges from transdermal to subcutaneous application through to Intravenous
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia (IV-PCA).

      The use of IV-PCA-pumps has considerable advantages including decreased delay in the
      administration of opioids from the time requested, individual dose intervals, self -control
      of their therapy, rapidity and ease of dose titration . These potential benefits, however are
      balanced by the need for careful assessment of adverse effects, including decreased quality
      of life because of the patient's sedation, constipation and possible episodes of bradypnoea
      and desaturation, eventually leading to respiratory depression (RD) requiring treatment.
      Often described safety features that help prevent overdosing are PCA bolus dose, delay, and
      lockout interval.

      Even though the risk of serious, potentially life threatening complications by using IV-PCA
      without a background infusion was described to be very low (0.24%) compared to other methods
      of opioid delivery , adverse effects like worrying degrees of hypoxemia and bradypnoea do
      occur and often remain undetected due to the lack of continuous monitoring. One of the
      possible causes of patient harm are medication errors associated with PCA administration, a
      common form of PCA errors, which is a significant source of preventable patient morbidity and
      hospital resource utilization.

      The individual patient response to a particular dose of opioids depends on diagnosed or
      unrecognized comorbidities. Clinical experience has shown that it is not possible to
      prospectively identify all patients who may be at increased risk.

      Conventional opioid monitoring protocol may fail to detect frequent episodes of bradypnoea
      and desaturation measured by the respiratory rate (RR) and Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen
      (SpO2) because even at a low respiratory rate SpO2 is usually maintained, so that pulse
      oxymetry might fail to detect respiratory deterioration, particularly if a patient is
      receiving supplemental oxygen.

      Therefore, continuous monitoring could be considered more sensitive, especially if it
      contains the measurement of Partial Pressure of Carbon dioxide (PCO2), which is a good
      parameter for monitoring ventilatory function.

      The 'gold standard' method to measure the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)
      is still the arterial blood gas analysis. But arterial sampling including catheterization or
      intermittent arterial puncture is invasive and expensive and associated with pain and
      discomfort for the patient. Therefore cutaneous carbon dioxide tension (PcCO2) measurement
      was suggested to be used as a non-invasive surrogate measure of PaCO2.

      SpO2, and tcPCO2, are important clinical parameters that should be used in conjunction with
      each other. SpO2 reflects oxygenation, while tcPCO2 reflects ventilation; the first can still
      be normal while the second may herald early changes in respiratory status. Capnography may
      provide the earliest indication of opioid-induced respiratory depression. It is important to
      monitor changes from a baseline tcPCO2 level. As the tcPCO2 level starts to increase, early
      intervention and changes in medication can be made.

      The present study aims to examine combined oxymetry and transcutaneous capnography using a
      single earlobe sensor (V-Sign™, Sentec AG, Therwil, Switzerland) in chronic pain patients
      treated with opioids where non-invasive monitoring of ventilation is needed because
      ventilatory disturbances are suspected. This may, potentially, improve patient's quality of
      life.

      1. Aim of study 1.1 Background

           Opioids are an effective instrument for patients with acute and chronic pain. Their
           route of administration ranges from transdermal to subcutaneous application through to
           Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia (IV-PCA).

           The use of IV-PCA-pumps has considerable advantages including decreased delay in the
           administration of opioids from the time requested, individual dose intervals, self
           -control of their therapy, rapidity and ease of dose titration . These potential
           benefits, however are balanced by the need for careful assessment of adverse effects,
           including decreased quality of life because of the patient's sedation, constipation and
           possible episodes of bradypnoea and desaturation, eventually leading to respiratory
           depression (RD) requiring treatment. Often described safety features that help prevent
           overdosing are PCA bolus dose, delay, and lockout interval.

           Even though the risk of serious, potentially life threatening complications by using
           IV-PCA without a background infusion was described to be very low (0.24%) compared to
           other methods of opioid delivery , adverse effects like worrying degrees of hypoxemia
           and bradypnoea do occur and often remain undetected due to the lack of continuous
           monitoring. One of the possible causes of patient harm are medication errors associated
           with PCA administration, a common form of PCA errors, which is a significant source of
           preventable patient morbidity and hospital resource utilization.

           But not only patients with IV-PCA-pumps are at risk of harm, but all patients treated
           with opioids (distinguished by their formulations; oral, dermal, intravenous,
           short-acting, continuous-release) are due to the feared adverse effect of respiratory
           depression.

           It can be caused by a self-potentiating &quot;vicious cycle&quot; which may result in respiratory
           arrest: Hypoventilation impairs gas exchange, resulting in increased carbon dioxide,
           decreased oxygen and pH (respiratory acidosis). In turn, suppression of the
           chemoreceptor responses to increased carbon dioxide levels reduces the normally
           protective central response which would increase breathing efforts.

           The individual patient response to a particular dose of opioids depends on diagnosed or
           unrecognized comorbidities. Clinical experience has shown that it is not possible to
           prospectively identify all patients who may be at increased risk.

           Conventional opioid monitoring protocol may fail to detect frequent episodes of
           bradypnoea and desaturation measured by the respiratory rate (RR) and Saturation of
           Peripheral Oxygen (SpO2) because even at a low respiratory rate SpO2 is usually
           maintained, so that pulse oxymetry might fail to detect respiratory deterioration,
           particularly if a patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.

           Therefore, continuous monitoring could be considered more sensitive, especially if it
           contains the measurement of Partial Pressure of Carbon dioxide (PCO2), which is a good
           parameter for monitoring ventilatory function. As the American Society of
           Anesthesiologists emphasizes, ventilation and oxygenation must be considered as separate
           physiologic processes. Ventilatory function is monitored by PCO2 whereas oxygenation is
           expressed through SpO2.

           Thus, even continuous monitoring of heart rate and SpO2 by pulse oxymetry is not a
           substitute for monitoring respiratory rate (RR) and PCO2. By capnographic monitoring
           patient's desaturation might be anticipated if a decrease in RR and thus rise of PCO2
           level from baseline occurs. Hence, adjustment of medication doses can be made earlier
           and serious adverse events may be prevented.

           The 'gold standard' method to measure the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
           (PaCO2) is still the arterial blood gas analysis. But arterial sampling including
           catheterization or intermittent arterial puncture is invasive and expensive and
           associated with pain and discomfort for the patient. Therefore cutaneous carbon dioxide
           tension (PcCO2) measurement was suggested to be used as a non-invasive surrogate measure
           of PaCO2.

           Transcutaneous measurement of CO2 (tcPCO2) is based on the observation that this gas has
           a high tissue solubility and diffusion through the skin. This permits the non-invasive
           measurement of the arterial PCO2. But despite increasing interest, the role of PCO2 as
           the real measure of respiratory function appears to be widely underestimated. The reason
           for PCO2 playing only a minor role may be referred to different causes: For many years
           measurement of tcPCO2 was inaccurate and impracticable with sensors being fragile and
           expensive, requiring frequent calibration and changing of skin site of the sensor to
           avoid thermal injury to the skin. But modern devices have features like automatic
           calibration, shorter response and equilibration times.

           Combined cutaneous capnography (tcPCO2) and oxymetry (SpO2) can now be gathered by a
           single earlobe sensor. Based on the Severinghaus principle , tcPCO2 is measured by a
           sensor with a heated surface electrode on the skin. The local hyperaemia induces an
           increase of arterial blood in the dermal capillary bed under the sensor. The usefulness
           of this method is limited in some clinical situations including profound peripheral
           vasoconstriction or circulatory centralization in shock or skin edema. Chhajed et al.
           could show a good agreement between values obtained by using combined oxymetry and
           transcutaneous capnography with arterial blood gas analyses in a large study sample.

           In conclusion, SpO2, and tcPCO2, are important clinical parameters that should be used
           in conjunction with each other. SpO2 reflects oxygenation, while tcPCO2 reflects
           ventilation; the first can still be normal while the second may herald early changes in
           respiratory status. Capnography may provide the earliest indication of opioid-induced
           respiratory depression. It is important to monitor changes from a baseline tcPCO2 level.
           As the tcPCO2 level starts to increase, early intervention and changes in medication can
           be made.

           The present study aims to examine combined oxymetry and transcutaneous capnography using
           a single earlobe sensor (V-Sign™, Sentec AG, Therwil, Switzerland) in chronic pain
           patients treated with opioids where non-invasive monitoring of ventilation is needed
           because ventilatory disturbances are suspected. The Sentec Monitoring System is already
           in use for years in clinical settings, for instance: Neonatology, Pneumology and
           Surgery, etc.

           The intention of this study is to prove the feasibility for using this sensor in a
           hospital setting which may allow avoiding oversedation leading to decreased activity and
           other troublesome adverse effects. This may, potentially, improve patient's quality of
           life.

           1.2 Specific aims

           We want to show that continuous monitoring using combined transcutaneous capnography and
           oxymetry allows for a better support for patients treated with opioids for chronic pain
           regarding pain quality and possible adverse events. Furthermore we want to use this
           study as a feasibility trial to generate new hypotheses for possible future studies.

           1.3 Hypothesis

           Continuous monitoring of tcPCO2 and SPO2 may help to warrant for a better support of
           patients with opioid administration by a minimal additional effort. In the end an
           effective monitoring shall contribute to enhance therapy control and therefore increase
           both patient's safety and quality of life.

        2. Study design

      This study will be used as a Feasibility Trial for possible future studies. Our primary
      objective is to investigate whether continuous monitoring by using the SenTec Monitoring
      System is feasible in patients with opioid administration.

      2.1 Study Procedures

      We plan to consecutively recruit patients who need for their pain control the IV-PCA,
      transdermal, oral or subcutaneous opioids and are hospitalized in the Hildegard Hospital in
      Basel, Switzerland. Recruitment of patients will start June 2012 and will end as soon as 30
      patients are recruited (at the latest in September 2013)

      30 patients needing IV-PCA, subcutaneous, transdermal or oral Opioids for their pain control,
      will be conventionally monitored during 24 hours after having filled out the informed consent
      form. Care workers will record principal and secondary diagnosis, measure respiratory rate
      (RR), note quantity and name of consumed opioids, record serious adverse events requesting
      antagonists, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or death and inquire for common adverse
      effects in opioid therapy such as sedation, pruritus, nausea/vomiting, dryness of the mouth,
      dizziness, myoclonus, constipation, fatigue, sweating, confusion and hallucinations. All
      patients will qualify their pain using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) as well as
      quantify their pain with the aid of a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

      For the subsequent 48h all patients will continuously be monitored by a single earlobe sensor
      (SenTec Monitoring System) in addition to the measurements/ questionnaires described above.
      Furthermore nurse's ratings of the additional time expense caused by the use of the SenTec
      Monitoring System will be recorded using a NRS.

      3 Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects 3.2 Recruitment of patients

      Patients treated with an IV-PCA and other application forms of opioids such as transdermal or
      subcutaneous opioid-administration for chronic pain who are hospitalized in the Hospital
      Hildegard, Basel, Switzerland, will be approached by a member of our study team. Patients are
      not only terminal Patients but as well Patients that are hospitalized for adjustment of pain
      medication and are going to be discharged. Participation in this study is voluntarily and the
      participating subjects will not be advantaged.

      3.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria

        -  Older than 18 years

        -  Capable of giving informed consent

        -  Needing opioids (oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, IV-PCA) for pain control (opioid naïve
           or patients on chronic opioid therapy ) 3.2 Subject exclusion criteria

        -  No consent for participation

        -  Absence of power of judgment 3.3 Subject Withdrawal

      In case a subject decides to discontinue our study for personal reasons, the withdrawal will
      be documented on the CRF (case report form) of the patient and another patient will be
      recruited to replace the study drop-out.

      4 Measures and Questionnaires

      4.1 SenTec Digital Monitoring System

      The SenTec Digital Monitoring System allows a continuous and non-invasive monitoring of
      carbon dioxide tension (PCO2), functional oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate. The
      portable patient monitor receives its signals over a cable adapted to a specific sensor
      (V-Sign™ Sensor) and sends it to a remote monitoring station and secondary alarm surveillance
      (V-CareNeT™). The signal will be forwarded additionally to a mobile application which is at
      the time designed and developed.

      The combined digital SaO2/PcCO2 sensor unifies the elements of an electrochemical
      Severinghaus-type carbon dioxide tension sensor with a conventional, reflectance
      2-wave-length pulse oxymetry which allows a noninvasive and continuous estimation of arterial
      carbon dioxide tension and oxygen saturation.

      This method to measure CO2 potentiometrically by determining the pH of electrolyte layer
      separated from the skin by a highly permeable membrane was described by Severinghaus and
      Bradley. The sensor is warmed to a constant surface temperature of 42.0°C to improve local
      arterialization and, hence, diminish the arterio-venous PCO2 difference and increase gas
      diffusion. Regular recalibration is mandatory for optimal transcutaneous signals and is known
      as a limiting factor. At this occasion skin surface will be inspected to avoid local
      side-effects. Sensors can be safely kept continuously for periods of up to 8 h with minimal
      risk of thermal skin injury. In case of further continuance in position the sensor will be
      programmed to trigger an alarm message and to cool down to 39.0°C automatically after 15
      minutes (a total of 8h 15 min) if the alarm hasn't been switched off in time.

      For subsequent analysis measurements will consecutively be downloaded from the SenTec Digital
      Monitoring System using V-STATS™ PC Software. The maximum period of measuring will be 3 days.

      4.2 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)

      The use of pain scales as the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is recommended for assessment of
      pain intensity based on self- report. The NRS is an 11-point scale consisting of integers
      from 0 (no pain) through 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Respondents then select the
      single number that best represents their pain intensity. An advantage of NRS is that
      incorrect responding does not appear to be associated with persons at risk for cognitive
      difficulties such as some elderly individuals or persons on high doses of opioid analgesics.

      Furthermore nurses ratings of the additional time expense by using the SenTec Monitoring
      System will be gathered by using the NRS (0 = no additional effort, 10 = maximal additional
      effort).

      4.3 Adverse effects

      Common adverse effects of opioid therapy will be reported by asking the patients themselves
      if they feel bothered by pruritus, nausea, dryness of the mouth, dizziness, myoclonus,
      constipation, fatigue, sweating, confusion and hallucinations (answer yes/no). Depth of
      sedation will be recorded by the nurses.

      4.4 McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)

      The McGill Pain Questionnaire was designed in 1975 for the use in pain patients to specify
      sensory, affective and evaluative dimensions of subjective pain experience. It provides
      quantitative information that can be treated statistically and is supposed to be sufficiently
      sensitive to detect differences among different methods to relieve pain. In 1988 a German
      version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire has been developed.

      4.5 Respiratory Depression

      Assessment of respiratory status goes hand in hand with sedation assessment. The nurse should
      watch the rise and fall of the patient's chest to determine the rate, depth, and regularity
      of respirations. There is no consensus on definition of a clinically significant respiratory
      depression. Clinical significance is featured by a decrease in rate and depth from patient's
      baseline respiratory status. We define respiratory depression as a decrease of respiratory
      rate on less than 8 breath per minute and/or PtcCO2 ≥ 6.0 kPa (≥45mmHg).

      4.6 Serious adverse events and complications

      Serious adverse events necessitating intervention such as the use of antagonists, positive
      pressure ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or death will be noted.

      4.7 Quantity of consumed opioids

      The quantity of consumed opioids during measuring time will be recorded noted in [mg]

      4.8 Advantage and disadvantage for nursing staff

      Nursing staff will be asked to declare gain and further efforts caused by additional
      monitoring using Sentec Monitoring System.

      6 Study Management and Administration

      6.1 Adherence to Protocol

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the approved protocol. In case of any
      significant deviations from the study protocol the investigator will send an amendment for
      further approval to the Ethical Committee EKBB.

      6.2 Data Collection and Protection

      To collect &quot;bed side&quot; data a computer generated paper sheet containing the name and date of
      birth of the subject will be used. This data will be transferred to a CRF (case report form)
      and in doing so rendered anonymous before statistical analysis will be performed.
      Subsequently data transfer will be controlled by at least one person.

      6.3 Archiving and Data Retention

      All study-related records, such as CRFs, medical records, informed consent documents,
      information regarding participants who discontinued, and other pertinent data will be
      maintained and therefore retained as long as required by the applicable Swiss regulatory
      requirements (10 Years).

      6.4 Direct Access to Original Data

      The investigator (s) will provide the study related monitoring visits, audits and regulatory
      inspections for direct access to all data acquired.

      6.5 Finances and Insurance

      The Investigator declares that he has taken out an insurance policy for the total study
      length, covering the participants in respect of the risks involved in this study.

      Study participants will receive no financial compensation for participation in this study.

      7 Ethical Consideration 7.1 Subjects Information and Consent

      All participating subjects will receive a consent form describing the study to help the
      subjects to make an informed consent about their participation in this study. Only after
      signing the consent form the subject will be submitted to any study procedure.

      This consent form that will be used is submitted with this protocol for approval by the EKBB.

      7.2 Risks and benefits for study participants

      Patients aren't exposed to any risk by participating in this study. In case of upward trend
      of the tcPCO2 detected by the SenTec Monitoring System or a decrease of the patient's
      respiratory rate leading to a possible future respiratory depression, dosage of opioids may
      be adjusted according to the responsible physician's prescription.
