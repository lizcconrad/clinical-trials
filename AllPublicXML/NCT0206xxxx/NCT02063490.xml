    <textblock>
      The study aim is to test the efficacy of one-year nurse-led interventions to improve the
      medication intake behaviour of chronic dialysis patients. The investigators hypothesis is the
      interventions leading to a 15% mean increase in intake, compared to standard care.

      Background Phosphate binder nonadherence is ubiquitous. The results of adherence enhancing
      interventions are often disappointing. The aim is to test a nurse-led multifactorial
      intervention to enhance phosphate binder adherence.

      Methods In a quasi-experimental clinical trial, phosphate binder adherence was measured
      electronically in 135 hemodialysis patients for one year and phosphatemia measured monthly.
      For all patients, months 1-2 were baseline (no interventions were performed). The
      intervention arm was given 1 &quot;preparatory&quot; intervention and then monthly 8 &quot;maintenance&quot;
      individualized management sessions. The control arm received standard of care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The intake of medication (phosphate binders) was monitored continuously for one year through electronic monitoring with the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Medication containers are filled with patients' phosphate binders and then capped with MEMS-caps registering the time and date of each opening and thus presumed intake of the medication in the box.
Mean adherence was calculated as the proportion of prescribed doses taken, averaged per month (e.g. patients with a ter in die regimen (84 doses/month) and taking them all 84 would have a mean adherence of 84/84=100%). Nonadherence was defined as a mean adherence &lt;80%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum phosphate</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly for one year</time_frame>
    <description>Serum phosphate was gathered monthly from patients' charts. In addition to mean serum phosphate per month we dichtomised this outcome measure with &gt;5mg/dL representing uncontrolled phosphatemia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>At study start and end (after one year)</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge was measured by ten multiple-choice questions about the phosphate cycle, phosphate binder pharmacodynamics and dietary recommendations, developed in previous research and added as appendix in a previous article (Van Camp Y, Vrijens B, Abraham I, et al. Adherence to phosphate binders in hemodialysis patients: prevalence and determinants. J Nephrol 2013; JNEPHROL-D-13-00176R1: Publicatin in process)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social support</measure>
    <time_frame>At study start and end (after one year)</time_frame>
    <description>Social support was measured by eleven questions assessing perceived support in general and support with taking phosphate binders specifically, developed in previous research and added as appendix in a previous article (Van Camp Y, Vrijens B, Abraham I, et al. Adherence to phosphate binders in hemodialysis patients: prevalence and determinants. J Nephrol 2013; JNEPHROL-D-13-00176R1: publication in process)</description>
