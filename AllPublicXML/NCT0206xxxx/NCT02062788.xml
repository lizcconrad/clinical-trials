    <textblock>
      Elective colectomy procedures typically require bowel preparation starting 2 days prior to
      the surgery. Osmotic laxatives such as Colyte® are administered 2 days prior, and Nothing by
      mouth (NPO) is required 1 day prior to ensure no fecal residue is left in the bowel. Though
      it may ensure a cleaner and safer surgery, this longer period of starvation increases insulin
      resistance and may increase post-op complications. However, there is evidence that
      administration of oral rehydration solution(ORS) prior to surgery reduces insulin resistance.
      Our purpose is to evaluate the difference of insulin resistance in those who received ORS 1
      day prior to surgery and those who did not.

      1. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) was
           introduced in the early 2000s by Kehlet et.al., and was applied primarily to patients
           receiving colectomy. As the knowledge and understanding of this concept continues to
           grow, we are now able to change the way we treat pre- and post- operative patients. In
           Europe, it has been proven that applying this concept to patients resulted in decreased
           length of post-operative hospital stay, post-op complications and overall hospital
           costs.

        2. The change in HOMA-IR with shorter preoperative Nothing by mouth (NPO) period in ERAS
           patients

             1. HOMA-IR Index equation (evaluation of Insulin resistance)

                = Insulin (μU/ml) X blood glucose (mg/dl) / 405

             2. HOMA-IR was statistically proven to have been lowered in patients who received ORS
                2hr prior to surgery.

             3. Reference

                  -  Increased insulin resistance induces hyperglycemia

                  -  Toxicity of post-op hyperglycemia and their relation to post-op complications

                  -  Insulin resistance increases in procedures such as herniorrhaphy or
                     laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of preoperative carbohydrates
                     decrease post-op nausea and vomiting

                  -  Conventional pre-op 8hr fasting increases insulin resistance and influences
                     increased glucose levels

        3. Additional benefits of shorter preoperative fasting

             1. Relieve of stress of fasting

             2. Help stabilize post-op triglyceride, cortisol, and glucose levels

             3. Reduce infectious complications
