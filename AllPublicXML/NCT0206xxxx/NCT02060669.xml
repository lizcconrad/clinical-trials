  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 10% to 15% of all cancers and is the second leading
      cause of cancer deaths in Western countries. Approximately half of all patients develop
      metastatic disease and become candidates for the palliative chemotherapy which has been
      proved to prolong survival and improve quality of life (QOL) in patients with metastatic CRC.
      The most active chemotherapy regiments include oxaliplatin or irinotecan combined with
      fluoropyrimidines.

      With overall survival in metastatic CRC nowadays routinely around 2 years, the same intensity
      of therapy can hardly be maintained throughout the course of therapy. The continuum of care
      therefore mandates changes in therapy, with treatment breaks or phases of less-intensive
      maintenance therapy interspersed with periods of more-intensive therapy to control tumor
      progression. Thereby, chemo-holidays conceivably reduce the cumulative toxicities of
      chemotherapy, potentially prevent the unplanned, premature discontinuation of therapy,
      preserve the ability to administer further phases of therapy, potentially maximize the time
      on therapy, reduce cost, and could increase QOL for patients. Several trials have tested the
      influence of chemo-holidays on patient outcome, with various rules on when to stop which
      component of antitumor therapy as follows; 1) Completely stopping all therapeutic agents,
      giving patients a completely chemotherapy-free interval (OPTIMOX-2, GISCAD), or 2) Stopping
      only those agents associated with significant (cumulative) toxicity while continuing other
      agents as maintenance therapy (OPTIMOX-1, Combined Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial
      [CONcePT]).

      Therefore, we'd like to test if capecitabine maintenance after 8 cycles of capecitabine
      combine with oxaliplatin (XELOX) could prolong progression-free survival without
      deterioration of QOL and toxicities in patients metastatic CRC.
