  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to
      the medication) of intranasally (through the nose) administered esketamine using a device
      with and without a nasal guide in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), single-center,
      single-dose, 2-way crossover (participants may receive different interventions sequentially
      during the study in 2 sequence groups), open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) study. Approximately, 14 participants will be enrolled in this study. This
      study will consist of a screening phase of up to 21 days, a treatment phase of 3 days, and a
      follow-up phase of 9-13 days. Participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment
      groups (Sequence 1 and 2). In sequence 1, participants will self-administer esketamine
      intranasally using a device with nasal guide as treatment A on Day 1 of period 1 and
      intranasally esketamine using a device without nasal guide as treatment B on Day 1 of period
      2. In sequence 2, participants will self-administer intranasally esketamine as treatment B on
      Day 1 of period 1 and intranasally esketamine as treatment A on Day 1 of period 2. There will
      be a washout period of 5 to 10 days between each treatment regimen. Safety evaluations will
      include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital
      signs, physical examination, pulse oximetry, targeted nasal examination, nasal device
      questionnaire, and in addition to these evaluations, specific scales will be used to assess
      the safety. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 45 days.

    <description>The CADSS is a clinician administered rating scale designed to measure dissociative symptoms. The CADSS comprises 23 subjective items, divided into 3 components: depersonalization, derealization and amnesia. Participant's responses are coded on a 5-point scale (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot; through to 4 = &quot;Extremely). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS is used for the measurement of psychiatric symptoms. The BPRS is an 18 item questionnaire and each question is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). The total score for the 18 question will be calculated by adding score of each question. The interpretation of the total scores are: 0-9 will indicate &quot;not a schizoaffective case&quot;; 10-20 will indicate &quot;possible schizoaffective case&quot;; and 21 or more, will indicate &quot;evident schizoaffective case&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
