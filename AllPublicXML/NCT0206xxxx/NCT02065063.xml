  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation, Phase I/II, open-label, three-part study. Part 1 is designed to
      determine the recommended dose and schedule for the orally administered MEK inhibitor
      trametinib, given together with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in subjects with solid
      tumors. Multiple dose levels of each inhibitor will be tested to determine the recommended
      dose and schedule. Part 2 will evaluate the effect of the combination on tumor biomarkers
      safety, and anti-cancer activity in subjects with cutaneous melanoma that do not have a
      change at BRAFV600. Approximately 100-200 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will
      receive trametinib and/or palbociclib until disease progression, death, consent withdrawal or
      unacceptable adverse event (AE).

      Data was only collected and analyzed for the Phase I component of the study, the Phase II
      component of the study was terminated without data collection
