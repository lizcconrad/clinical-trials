  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological problems are prevalent among patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The
      bi-directional interaction between psychological well-being and seizure have been recognized
      in recent years. Reduction of psychological stress has the potential to improve seizure
      manifestation.

      The present study uses an assessor-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based psychotherapy and an attentional-placebo social
      support on improving psychological well-being, seizure control and cognitive performance
      among adult patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
