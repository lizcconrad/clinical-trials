    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase I/III study
      investigating the 14 day single-dose pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy and safety of BT524
      following intravenous administration in the treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding in patients
      with congenital afibrinogenemia or severe congenital hypofibrinogenemia.

    <description>Secondary objectives are to investigate the 14 day single-dose pharmacodynamics of BT524, and the surrogate efficacy and safety of BT524 in part I of the study. In addition, the hemostatic efficacy, surrogate efficacy, and safety of single and/or repetitive administrations for on-demand prophylaxis (ODP) and/or on-demand treatment (ODT) of bleeding events will be investigated.</description>
