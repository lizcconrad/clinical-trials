    <textblock>
      Gastro-Esophageal Reflux is a commonly encountered problem in infants. After failure of
      medical therapy, many children are referred for surgical intervention. Techniques have
      evolved over the last 50 years; however, benefits in children remain the center of debate in
      many surgical forums. This is primarily owing to the high incidence of recurrence of reflux
      and need for revisions later in life. Some clinicians theorize that the pathophysiology of
      reflux in infants is different from that of the population at large, and that the traditional
      operation may not be the best suited for this patient population. We propose a study to test
      an alternative plication technique for modifying the gastro-esophageal junction at the Angle
      of Hiss. By plicating the cardia of the stomach, we hypothesize that we will create a valve
      which will limit reflux without disrupting the diaphragmatic crura, thus reducing the
      incidence of recurrent hiatal hernia and limiting the incidence of fundoplications which are
      too tight.
