      This is an open label, multi-center, single arm phase II study. The study will investigate
      the efficacy of sodium cridanimod in conjunction with progestin therapy in a population of
      patients with recurrent or persistent PrR-negative endometrial cancer.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and administered sodium cridanimod in
      combination progestin therapy. Objective responses will be assessed at 12 week intervals.
      Patients will be treated for a 12 month period, followed by an additional 12 month follow up
      period or to disease progression whichever occurs first.

      Important objectives of the study are to investigate the effect of sodium cridanimod in
      conjunction with progestin therapy on the level of PrR in tumor tissue and how this
      correlates to efficacy. To accomplish this objective, some of the patients enrolled in the
      study will undergo two tumor biopsies that will allow measurement of PrR levels in the tumor
      tissue before the treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients age 18 and older;

          -  Histologically confirmed papillary serous adenocarcinoma or endometrioid type of
             endometrial carcinoma (histological documentation of recurrence is not required);

          -  Patient has documented evidence of PrR negative endometrial cancer. PrR negativity can
             be determined by immunohistochemistry. The tumor is considered PrR negative if the
             number of PrR positive cells is less than 1% determined by immunohistochemistry;

          -  Availability of tumor tissue sample that can be used for assessment of PrR levels with
             the use of immunohistochemistry;

          -  Recurrent or persistent (after the failure of chemotherapy) disease that cannot be
             treated with surgery or radiotherapy;

          -  Documented disease progression after a platinum based chemotherapy in patients for
             whom administration of taxanes and anthracyclines is not planned. Progression must
             fulfill one of the following criteria:

               -  Progression has occurred within 30 days of platinum based chemotherapy consisting
                  of minimum of two cycles of cisplatin-based (≥60 mg/m2/cycle) or
                  carboplatin-based (≥300 mg/m2/cycle, or area under the time-concentration curve
                  ≥4) chemotherapy.

               -  Progression after neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy if the
                  recurrence occurred while on neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or within 6 months
                  since the last administration of such therapy.

          -  Prior major surgery less than 4 weeks prior to the start of the study;
