  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a trial on an oral orthotic for
      reducing tic severity in children ages 7-25 years with Tourette syndrome (TS) or Chronic Tic
      Disorder (CTD).

    <textblock>
      The study is a 2 group, 2 week randomized controlled feasibility trial of an active vs sham
      oral orthotic to reduce tic severity in children and adolescents ages 7-25 years. Responders
      to acute phase treatment will be followed for 10 additional week (12 weeks total) to assess
      intervention durability, safety and acceptability. Non-responders to the sham orthotic will
      be provided active treatment at the end of the 2 week acute phase. We aim to assess and
      enroll 24 participants; twelve participants will receive an orthotic adjusted to the
      appropriate therapeutic height, and twelve participants will receive an identical sham
      orthotic, but not adjusted to the recommended height for the given participant.
