    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      Warfarin is now the most commonly used oral anticoagulant. This drug has inter-individual
      variability due to the genetic polymorphisms in the warfarin metabolizing enzyme, CYP2C9 and
      warfarin target, VKORC1. The investigators' team developed a pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm
      which can predict patients required warfarin dose, thus could prevent warfarin induced
      warfarin adverse events.

      Methods:

      The investigators recruited patients with indications for warfarin, the genotypes of VKORC1
      and CYP2C9 were determined by the hospitals and verified by National Center for Genome
      Medicine. The investigators then randomized the patients to one of three arms: 1. Warfarin
      dose predicted by dosing algorithm developed by the International Warfarin pharmacogenetic
      Consortium (IWPC), 2. Algorithm developed by the Taiwan Warfarin Consortium and 3. Standard
      of care. The investigators aimed to determine whether using genetic dosing algorithm can lead
      to more stable dose and safer use of the drug.
