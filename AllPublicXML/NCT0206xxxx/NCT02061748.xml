      <recruitment_details>A non-interventional study based on existing data was conducted. This is a retrospective database analysis to assess the safety and effectiveness of dabigatran compared to warfarin in patients diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in the real-world setting using the Humana population.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participant flow and demographic section is based on Pre-propensity score matching data however to analyze the outcome measures Post-propensity score matching data were used.</pre_assignment_details>

Ischemic stroke includes: Occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries with cerebral infarction, Occlusion of cerebral arteries with cerebral infarction and Acute, but ill-defined, cerebrovascular disease but excludes above diagnosis if hospitalization lasted less than 48 hours and was accompanied by carotid endarterectomy.
Hemorrhagic stroke includes: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) but excludes previous listed diagnoses if “traumatic brain injury” or “rehabilitation care” is present.
Study outcomes for this analysis were identified using either the admitting diagnoses or on any of the service lines associated with an inpatient hospitalization.</description>

        <description>This outcome measure describes the incidence of major bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke, major intracranial bleeding and major extracranial bleeding) for dabigatran and warfarin in the primary analysis.
Major Intracranial Bleeding includes subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, other and unspecified intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage following injury without mention of open intracranial wound, subdural hemorrhage following injury without mention of open intracranial wound, extradural hemorrhage following injury without mention of open intracranial wound, other and unspecified intracranial hemorrhage following injury without mention of open intracranial wound but excludes these codes if major trauma was present. Major extracranial bleeding includes major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, major urogenital bleeding and major other bleeding.

        <title>Hemorrhagic Stroke (Post-hoc Analysis)</title>
        <description>This outcome measure describes the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke for dabigatran and warfarin in the post-hoc analysis. Hemorrhagic stroke includes: Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage but excludes these codes if “traumatic brain injury” or “rehabilitation care” as primary code is present.
A post-hoc analysis was conducted that measured outcomes using an algorithm to define the principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis was defined as the primary diagnosis on the first room and board charge record within a hospital admission. This method results in identification of a single outcome for a hospitalization.</description>

          <description>This outcome measure describes the incidence of major extracranial bleeding for dabigatran and warfarin in the post-hoc analysis. Major extracranial bleeding includes: major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, major urogenital bleeding and major other bleeding.
A post-hoc analysis was conducted that measured outcomes using an algorithm to define the principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis was defined as the primary diagnosis on the first room and board charge record within a hospital admission. This method results in identification of a single outcome for a hospitalization.</description>

Major lower GI bleeding includes diverticulosis or diverticulitis of small intestine or of colon with hemorrhage, hemorrhage of rectum and anus, angiodysplasia of intestine with hemorrhage, blood in stool and hemorrhage of GI tract (unspecified).
A post-hoc analysis was conducted that measured outcomes using an algorithm to define the principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis was defined as the primary diagnosis on the first room and board charge record within a hospital admission. This method results in identification of a single outcome for a hospitalization.</description>

        <title>Other Major Bleeds (Post-hoc Analysis)</title>
        <description>This outcome measure describes the incidence of other major bleeds for dabigatran and warfarin in the post-hoc analysis.
Other major bleeds includes hemarthrosis, hemopericardium, hemoptysis, epistaxis, hemorrhage (not specified) and acute posthemorrhagic anemia.
A post-hoc analysis was conducted that measured outcomes using an algorithm to define the principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis was defined as the primary diagnosis on the first room and board charge record within a hospital admission. This method results in identification of a single outcome for a hospitalization.</description>

        <title>Pulmonary Embolism (Post-hoc Analysis)</title>
        <description>This outcome measure describes the incidence of pulmonary embolism for dabigatran and warfarin in the post-hoc analysis.
Pulmonary embolism includes acute pulmonary heart disease. A post-hoc analysis was conducted that measured outcomes using an algorithm to define the principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis was defined as the primary diagnosis on the first room and board charge record within a hospital admission. This method results in identification of a single outcome for a hospitalization.</description>
