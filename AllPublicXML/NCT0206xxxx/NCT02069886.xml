    <textblock>
      The CENTAurus trial is a prospective clinical study designed to address systematically some
      of the relevant endocrine complications in an iron overloaded thalassemic population, primary
      objective being the assessment of the effect of deferasirox therapy on glucose
      metabolism/homeostasis. Other endocrine parameters complementary or supportive to the primary
      objective will be assessed and analyzed during this study. A number of lab parameters related
      to other axes of the endocrine system will be collected and analyzed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of glucose blood level measured after 2 h after receiving a glucose-equivalent oral challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable is the change (mg/dl) from baseline to 36 months of glucose plasma levels measured 2 hr post glusose equivalent oral challange.
After a 12-hour overnight fasting, at zero time (baseline) blood sample will be drawn and afterwards patients will receive a glucose-equivalent oral challenge (75 grams). After glucose loading plasma samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for determination of plasma glucose. This will be repeated every 6 month till end of study</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glucose of OGTT ( AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and every 6 months measurement of 2hour Glocose of OGTT</time_frame>
    <description>change in of glucose metabolism during deferasirox treatment measuring the change versus baseline of 2-hr and fasting glucose plasma level of OGTT.After a 12-hour overnight fasting, at zero time (baseline) blood sample will be drawn and afterwards patients will receive a glucose-equivalent oral challenge (75 grams). After glucose loading plasma samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for determination of plasma glucose . This will be repeated every 6 months till end of study</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change on insulin secretion and sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and every 6 months measurement of 2hr Glucose OGTT</time_frame>
    <description>Change in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity at every measurement versus screening. Stumvol Formula will be applied to values of 2hr glucose OCTT to calucolate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. After a 12-hour overnight fasting, at zero time (baseline) blood sample will be drawn and afterwards patients will receive a glucose-equivalent oral challenge (75 grams). After glucose loading plasma samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for determination of insulin concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of thyroid hormones TSH and FT4</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and every 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in plasma levels of TSH and FT4 at every measurement versus screening. Blood samples will be drawn from the patient at baseline and every 12 month till end of study and plansa concentration of thyroid hormons TSH and FT4 will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk factors for the impairment of glucose homeostasis</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and monthly till End of Study</time_frame>
    <description>information on age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, metabolic syndrome (hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypertrygliceridemia), chronic use of steroids, use of immunosuppressive drugs, growth hormonal deficit will be collected on a monthly basis till end of study</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in endocrine funcionts parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and monthly till EOS</time_frame>
    <description>- Female patients will be assessed for the presence or absence of menses every month versus baseline .Use of current hormonal replacing therapy, if any (e.g. thyroxin therapy for patients with non-compensated hypothyroidism, hormonal replacement drugs for hypogonadal patients) will be checked on a monthly basis versus baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in parameters of bone metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, monthly or every 6 months till end of study</time_frame>
    <description>- Blood samples wiil be drawn to measure levels of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D levels (25-hydroxycholecalciferol), serum calcium, parathormone (intact 1-84 PTH) from baseline to the end of study. Blood samples will be drawn to assess also Vitamin D and parathormone at baseline and then every six months. The intact parathormone will be assessed by evaluating the 1-84 PTH form. Inorganic phosphorus, serum calcium will be assessed at baseline and then monthly; alkaline phosphatase will be evaluated at baseline, every two weeks during the first month of treatment and monthly thereafter till EOS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Iron overload status</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and regularly till end of study (monthly or yearly as specified)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be drawn to assess Serum Ferriting. Liver and cardiac iron will be assessed by MRI (MRI R2 annual measurements for liver, MRI T2* annual measurements for cardiac); -Relationship between changes in SF, LIC and cardiac T2* and changes in primary (OGTT) and secondary endpoints (glucose metabolism trend, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity);</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of deferasirox therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at every scheduled visit (weekly for the first months or after dose escalation and monthly thereafter or yearly till EOS</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical and laboratory monitoring of AEs and SAEs (in particular changes in hepatic, renal, audiometric and ophthalmology parameters). Blood samples will be drawn to assess liver functions, renal funtions. Urine test will be performed to assess renal functions. An audiometric and ophalmologic visit will be done to assess eyes and ears functions.</description>
