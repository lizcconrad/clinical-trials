    <textblock>
      Background: Statins are the recently evolved agents that aid in periodontal regeneration and
      ultimately attaining periodontal health. Atorvastatin (ATV) and Simvastatin (SMV) are
      specific competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The
      present study was designed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of 1.2% ATV, and 1.2%
      SMV as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment subjects with chronic
      periodontitis.

      Methods: Ninety six subjects were categorized into three treatment groups: SRP plus 1.2% ATV,
      SRP plus 1.2% SMV and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters; full mouth plaque index (PI),
      modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and relative attachment level
      (RAL) were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 3, 6 and 9 months. Percentage radiographic
      defect depth reduction was evaluated using computer-aided software at baseline, 6 months and
      9 months.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study was change in radiographic intra-bony defect depth from baseline to 9 months in all the groups. Intra-bony defect depth was measured on the radiograph by measuring the vertical distance from the crest of the alveolar bone to the base of the defect.</description>

    <time_frame>9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Probing depth was measured from gingival margin to the base of pocket with a University of North Carolina no. 15 color-coded periodontal probe. change in probing depth was measured from baseline to 9 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in Relative attachment level</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Relative attachment level was measured from a fixed point on the acrylic stent to the to the base of pocket. . A custom-made acrylic stent and a University of North Carolina no. 15 color-coded periodontal probe were used to standardize the measurement. Change was measured from baseline to 9 months.</description>
