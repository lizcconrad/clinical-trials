  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10 year study of scleroderma patients with calcinosis 1) to better understand how
      common and if there are any risk factors for having calcinosis

      2) to identify common complications associated with scleroderma-related calcinosis.

      This is a prospective study of scleroderma- spectrum patients focused on soft tissue
      calcinosis in order 1) to better understand the risk factors (including clinical/laboratory
      characteristics, and serology) of calcinosis in the scleroderma-spectrum disorders (limited
      or diffuse systemic sclerosis with or without overlap of inflammatory arthritis and/or
      myositis).

      2) view common complications associated with calcinosis.

      Better understanding of scleroderma calcinosis would lead to other studies that eventually
      will define better treatment options for this incurable and often disabling complication.

    <description>This is an observational study of scleroderma calcinosis over 3 years duration, to assess possible risk factors (including serologic studies and disease types) as well as common complications that occur in those with scleroderma calcinosis in this time period.
No additional intervention will be delivered, other than standard of care for this complication.</description>
