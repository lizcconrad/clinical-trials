      Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of an abdominal belt in the treatment of chronic
      mechanical-postural low back pain.

      Methods: A randomized controlled trial was carried out, involving 60 consecutively selected
      patients with chronic low back pain randomly allocated to an intervention group (use of
      abdominal belt) and control group (non-use of abdominal belt). Patients were evaluated at the
      baseline of the study (T0) as well as 1 (T1), 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6) after the inclusion.
      The patients were assessed for: pain (VAS); functional capacity (Roland Morris), patient
      satisfaction (Likert scale); and number of anti-inflammatory pills ingested.
      Intention-to-treat analysis was also used.

      Hypothesis - abdominal belt will improve pain in chronic low back pain patients

They should record the number of hours of belt use per day on spreadsheets distributed for this purpose.</description>
