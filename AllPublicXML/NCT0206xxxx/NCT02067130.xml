  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with hereditary anemias (e.g. thalassemias), defective red blood cells are
      produced due to an error in the genes, or DNA, that provide the instructions for their
      synthesis. As a result, hereditary anemias are characterized by chronically low hemoglobin,
      which is contained inside red blood cells and carries oxygen throughout the body. In more
      severe cases, patients are dependent on frequent blood transfusions to replenish the
      hemoglobin.

      The body has limited ability to get rid of excess iron. However, with repeated blood
      transfusions, the iron level in the body builds up because the red blood cells contain iron
      as heme. Over time, the high level of iron accumulates in organs such as the heart, liver,
      and pancreas causing heart problems, liver failure, and diabetes. As a result, patients who
      receive multiple blood transfusions need to be monitored for iron overload, and be started on
      medical therapy in a timely fashion to prevent organ damage.

      Liver is usually the first and the most affected organ by iron accumulation, so knowledge of
      its iron concentration provides estimate of total body iron load. Liver biopsy is the gold
      standard in measuring the iron concentration in the liver, but it is invasive and cannot be
      performed on routine basis. MRI is another option that can assess liver iron concentration
      non-invasively, and is currently recommended for monitoring iron load on a yearly basis.
      However, MRI has a high cost and is not easily accessible in Canada. The investigators aim to
      determine if transient elastography (Fibroscan), which is a form of ultrasound that measures
      liver stiffness, can accurately assess liver iron concentration.

      Hypothesis:

      Fibroscan reading correlates with MRI and serum ferritin in estimating hepatic iron
      concentration.

      Inclusion criteria: All adult patients (age 19 or greater) with hereditary anemias requiring
      chronic blood transfusion at St. Paul's Hospital will be invited to participate in this
      study. The majority of patients will be β-Thalassemia Major. They will be given a pamphlet
      containing the details of the study and can contact the research assistant or clinic nurse
      for more information should they be interested.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients with known Hepatitis B positive, known Hepatitis C positive,
      known HIV positive, known liver cirrhosis, known primary liver disease such as Wilson's
      disease and hereditary hemochromatosis are excluded from the study.

      Written consent will be obtained from all participants by the clinic nurse/research assistant
      prior to enrollment.

      Study procedures:

      Data to be collected retrospectively from patient charts (St. Paul's Hospital's EMR/Sunrise
      Clinical Manager and paper chart) include: baseline demographic data (age, gender,
      hematological condition), medical comorbidities and complications related to iron overload
      (Diabetes, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy/arrhythmia and congestive heart failure,
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, osteopenia and osteoporosis syndrome..etc), current
      medications including use of iron chelators such as desferrioxamine, deferasirox, deferiprone
      or combination therapy, viral hepatitis status (B and C) and date of test, liver cirrhosis
      status (stage), liver biopsy result (iron concentration) and date of procedure. Patients with
      chronic transfusion requirement usually undergo annual MRI at the beginning of the year to
      estimate hepatic iron concentration as per standard practice. This year (2013), R2 MRI
      (FerriScan) will also be available for the first time to all patients in BC as part of
      routine monitoring for iron overload. Details/results from both techniques (i.e. same images
      collected in one scan, but analyzed differently using R2 and T2* algorithms) will be
      collected.

    <description>Subjects enrolled will undergo Fibroscan. It is an affordable and noninvasive tool for measuring liver stiffness as a predictor of liver fibrosis. Fibroscan reading will be collected at the Gastroenterologist's (Dr. Ko) outpatient clinic (Pacific Gastroenterology Associates) where a qualified research nurse/assistant will perform the scan under supervision of the physician. Anticipated timing of this procedure will be October to December 2013</description>

    <description>Transient elastography (Fibroscan®) is an affordable and noninvasive tool for measuring liver stiffness as a predictor of liver fibrosis. Since Fibroscan® measures liver's stiffness, its utility is not limited to fibrosis, and has been extended to other conditions that would increase the liver's stiffness, such as amyloidosis (Loustaud-Ratti et al. Amyloid 2011) and perhaps iron overload.</description>
