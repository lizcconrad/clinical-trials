  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since droxidopa has been approved in Japan for treating freezing of gait in Parkinson's
      disease patients, this is to confirm and further investigate the safety and efficacy using a
      similar dose. The possible beneficial effects on cognition in mildly cognitively impaired
      Parkinson's disease patients will also be tested, since this problem in Parkinson's disease
      may be associated with decreased brain synthesis of norepinephrine (a neurotransmitter
      associated with multiple brain functions).

      During this 11 week study, droxidopa will be slowly titrated up to 600 mg daily. Walking and
      freezing of gait will be evaluated and rated. Cognitive functions will be evaluated by a
      computer-based program.
