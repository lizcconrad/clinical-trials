      A Bone Anchored Port System (BAP) will be implanted in the mastoid bone behind the ear,
      connected with a double lumen central venous catheter inserted in the jugular vein, and will
      be used in conjunction with an adapter as a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis
      treatment.

      STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate feasibility
      regarding safety, efficiency and clinical performance of the BAP as a permanent access for
      chronic haemodialysis therapy in patients with renal failure to reach the certificate
      European (CE) mark and conduct a post market follow-up study.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT

        1. Device survival probability after one year (product - limit estimator of Kaplan-Meier
           Analysis).

        2. An event is the primary failure of BAP, defined by necessity to remove the device: for
           any medical reason (e.g. infections at wound or mastoid, thrombosis, and severe patient
           discomfort)

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

        1. Performance - Implantation and primary healing process

             -  Failure to implant a device due to procedural complications or unforeseen
                anatomical reasons, except for intra-operatively detected exclusion criteria

             -  Successful attempt on the site contralateral to the planned side

             -  Duration of the implantation procedure measured from incision to final suture

             -  Duration of hospitalization before implantation / after implantation

             -  Time from implantation to first use for haemodialysis

             -  Rate of patients with complications stratified by

                  -  Hematothorax

             -  Initial healing and stabilization of BAP, Infections at implantation site

             -  Septicaemias with no other source of infection than surgical-procedures impairment
                for mechanical reasons

        2. Performance - removal of catheter

             -  Failure to provide a blood flow ≥200ml/min for more than 2 consecutive weeks

             -  Catheter related and untreatable infection

             -  Surgical or interventional (Seldinger technique) procedure

             -  Persistent recirculation higher than 15%

        3. Performance - Dialysis use

             -  Average blood flow rate

             -  Average venous pressure

             -  Average arterial pressure

             -  Recirculation

             -  Volume-corrected clearance (Kt/V)

             -  Access thrombosis reversible by non-surgical means

             -  Infections of any kind

                  -  in anatomical structures around implant

                  -  remote infections possibly related to the BAP

                  -  bacteriemia/septicemia

        4. Design Validation

             -  Questionnaire for the implantation surgeon

             -  Questionnaire for the dialysis staff

             -  Questionnaire for patients

             -  Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire (EQ-5D)

             -  Questionnaire for change / removal of catheter

    <description>The port body will be implanted onto the petrous bone, a sealing cap, a twofold valve system and a catheter connected to the port body. The catheter is tunneled under the skin, enters the internal jugular vein and ends in the right atrium of the heart. The novelty of the access lies in its location (retro auricular on petrous bone) and its bone fixation</description>
