      Background: Hemiplegia is one of the main reasons why stroke survivors lose their walking and
      balancing ability. Many studies point out that cycling is an effective means for lower limb
      rehabilitation. However, during training, the unaffected limb may compensate for the affected
      one resulting in suboptimal rehabilitation. To address this issue, the investigators
      developed the virtual reality-cycling training system (VRCTS) which can acquire force and
      speed signals in real-time through a cycling module. The system then analyzes the acquired
      data and uses a 3D VR rehabilitation program to help patients to train their affected side.
      The aim of the study was to develop the VRCTS, verify its function and test system function
      on both normal subjects and stroke patients.

      Methods: In this system, the investigators designed a cycling device that is embedded with
      load cell and encoder sensors to detect cycling force and angle in real-time. A Cycling Graph
      User Interface Control and Data Recode System (Cycling CR System) was applied for signal
      analysis and feedback control. The investigators designed a 3D interactive VR rehabilitation
      program that can guide and train the users through visual feedback. Each user performed a
      pre-test to examine determine condition, left-right balance and other parameters, which
      allows the system to be customized.
