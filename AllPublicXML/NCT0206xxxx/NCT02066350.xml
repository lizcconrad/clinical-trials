    <textblock>
      Patients accepted for the waiting list for single pancreas transplantation suffer from severe
      glucose instability with hyperglycemia due to diabetes type 1, but do not have significant
      diabetes-related complications. Pancreas transplantation restores normoglycemia in diabetes
      type 1 patients with unstable control of glycemia. Both hypo- and hyperglycemic events are
      abolished, and 70-80 % of the patients obtain satisfactory HbA1c levels (HbA1c 5.0-6.0 %)
      without the need of exogenous insulin. Endothelial dysfunction is considered as an early and
      potentially reversible stage in the atherosclerotic process. The endothelium is involved in
      homeostasis, leucocyte adhesion and vasomotor activity. Reduced endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation is associated with increments in cardiovascular risk factors, and endothelial
      dysfunction is a predictor for future cardiovascular disease. It has also been hypothesized
      that endothelial dysfunction may be involved in the impaired glycemic control by reducing the
      availability of glucose in peripheral muscles.Establishing normoglycemia by pancreas
      transplantation alone in previously diabetic type 1 patients has recently been shown to
      improve left ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by Doppler echocardiographic
      examination. In diabetic patients receiving a new pancreas it is possible to assess the
      effect of changing blood glucose excursions on cardiovascular risk factors, including
      endothelial function, without the use of antidiabetic drugs (exclude pleiotropic effects).

      The primary objective of the present study is to assess if endothelial function (assessed by
      flow-mediated dilatation of arteria brachialis) is improved when hyperglycemia is reversed by
      single pancreas transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the changes in the following parameters by reversal
      of hyperglycemia by pancreas transplantation; Peripheral arterial tonometry, serum/plasma
      concentrations of endothelial dysfunction markers, blood pressure, lipid and lipoprotein
      concentrations.

    <description>This is an explorative analysis to assess the impact of establishing normoglycemia in previously hyperglycemic patients, without using antidiabetic drugs, by investigating patients before and after single pancreas transplantation. Active patients on the waiting list for single pancreas transplantation will be investigated while on the waiting list and subsequently 8 weeks and 1 year after transplantation if they have a functioning pancreas graft. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of large vessels (arteria brachialis) will be assessed by measuring vessel diameter by ultrasound and the FMD of micro vessels in the finger tip will be assessed by Endo-PAT (PAT=Peripheral Arterial Tonus) following reactive hyperperfusion induced by occlusion of the artery by a sphygmomanometer cuff.</description>

    <description>Measurement of bone mineral density, using low dosage radiation (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan) to assess the amount (grams) of mineral that are packed into a segment of bone.

    <description>Renal function, defined as glomerular filtration rate, will be evaluated by measuring iohexol clearance. The concentration of iohexol (Omnipaque), a low dose non-ionic x-ray contrast medium of low osmolality, extensively used in clinical radiology and considered essentially free from side effects, will be measured 2 hours and 5 hours after iv injection of iohexol. Like other iodine-containing contrast media, it is completely eliminated from the body by excretion in the urine, thus it is an ideal marker for kidney function. It will be quantitated by chemical measurement based on the determination of iodine.</description>
