      The goal of this study is to determine if scheduled communication with the oncology team
      through phone calls is helpful to caregivers with the transition to hospice care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four parts of the study. First, the participant will receive phone calls twice a
      week from the oncology team to check in with how the transition to hospice is going. Second,
      the participant may choose to have an appointment with the Massachusetts General Hospital
      oncology team to discuss any questions or concerns regarding cancer care or the transition to
      hospice. Third, each week of hospice care, the participant will be asked to complete a set of
      questionnaires at a time that is convenient for them either by phone or by email. These
      questions will ask the participant about their recent thoughts and feelings about their
      experience with hospice and as a caregiver. The questions will take less than 15 minutes to
      answer. Fourth, after hospice care has ended, the participant will be called by the oncology
      team to again check in and about a month later, the participant will also be contacted by
      phone to complete a set of questionnaires, again asking about their thoughts and feelings
      about your experience with hospice and as a caregiver.

      For all of the questionnaires, the participant may skip any questions that the participant
      prefers not to answer. The responses will remain confidential and will be available only to
      study staff members who are trained in confidentiality and research ethics.

      Additionally, during the research study, the investigators will obtain information from the
      participant's loved one's Massachusetts General Hospital electronic medical record that is
      relevant to the participation in the study for up to 6 months. If he/she has visited another
      hospital during this time, the investigator will also ask the participant for their
      permission to obtain the medical records from this visit.

      The participant will not receive any compensation for this study.

    <measure>Evaluate the feasibility of implementing the Ensuring Communication in Hospice by Oncology Study (ECHO) intervention by patients' family caregivers and their oncology providers.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>ECHO will be considered feasible if greater than 70% of participants have &gt; 50% of the scheduled phone contact with the oncology team during hospice care, which will be documented in the patient's medical record. Feasibility will also be demonstrated if greater than 70% of the family caregivers completing the questionnaires do so greater than 50% of the time they were scheduled. Finally, feasibility will also be demonstrated if caregivers are able to be contacted and decide upon participation within 5 days of patient hospice enrollment.</description>
