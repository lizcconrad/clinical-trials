    <textblock>
      This registry will collect real-world clinical evidence on the performance, safety, and
      usability of the ACIST CPM System and NAVVUS Catheter when used in accordance with approved
      labeling in a European commercial setting. Up to 60 subjects will have Fractional Flow
      Reserve (FFR) measurements of coronary lesions attempted with the CPM System and NAVVUS
      Catheter. All subjects will receive diagnostic treatment according to clinical indications
      and center standard practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no protocol-specific procedural requirements for this registry. Enrolled subjects
      will undergo a diagnostic angiography procedure including an FFR measurement with the CPM
      System and NAVVUS Catheter according to the center standard of care and the Instructions for
      Use of the CPM System and Navvus Catheter. Participants will be followed for the duration of
      hospital stay, an expected average of 1 day.
