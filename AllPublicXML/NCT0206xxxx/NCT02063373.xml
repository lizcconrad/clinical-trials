      Treatment: five intro-articular Hyaluronic Acid injection

      Assessment has two parts, that are as follow:

        1. Postural stability and risk of fall assessment using Biodex stability index and &quot;Timed
           up and Go&quot; test

        2. Gait and stair climbing assessment using Vicon motion capture system synchronized with
           four force plates.

      For knee OA subjects, assessment was done in week one or before injection; and for healthy
      controls one assessment was performed.

      This study aimed to assess the effect of hyaluronic acid injection on Postural stability,
      biomechanics of gait and stair climbing in individuals with bilateral knee osteoarthritis
      (OA).

      Participants were individuals with knee OA (control and treatment) and healthy people.
