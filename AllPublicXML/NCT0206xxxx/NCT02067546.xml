    <textblock>
      Emptying disorders are of the most common causes of constipation. An adjustable toilet seat
      was designed by &quot; Shva-Nach&quot; Ltd company, and is designed to facilitate the angle sitting
      position.

      Its efficacy will be evaluated in the current study, on 50 volunteers who suffer from
      constipation and meet the Rome 3 criteria for constipation.

      Emptying disorders are of the most common causes of constipation. Laxatives are usually
      unsuccessful. Behavioral therapy such as anorectal biofeedback , have a limited success in
      most hospitals in this country. Toilet seat that lifts the legs and brings us into a sitting
      position closer to squatting (which is the desired physiological position) can relieve these
      patients in the emptying process.

      The Company &quot; Shva-Nach&quot; Ltd. and its design team designed a seat at an angle slightly
      elevated and a toilet stool customized to the personal anatomy of each subject.

      The purpose of the study: evaluating efficacy elevated toilet seat with a support of a
      brackets stool making emptying easier in patients with constipation and difficulty in
      emptying.

      Methods: An open, randomized, crossover study in use of a toilet seat and comparing it to a
      standard seat.
