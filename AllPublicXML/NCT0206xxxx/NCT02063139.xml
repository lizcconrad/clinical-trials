    <measure>To show non-inferiority of flutiform pMDI 50/5 µg (2 puffs bid) versus fluticasone pMDI 50 µg (2 puffs bid) based on the mean lower leg growth rates.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in growth rate during the each treatment and washout period which is 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lower leg length will be measured in the afternoon, between 13:00 and 19:00h. Each individual subject will have their knemometry measurements performed at the same time of day (+/- 1 hour).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the safety of flutiform pMDI 50/5 µg (2 puffs bid) versus fluticasone pMDI 50 µg based on overnight urinary free cortisol (corrected for creatinine).</measure>
    <time_frame>every two weeks for duration of study which is two months.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will empty their bladder into the toilet before going to bed at night (or no later than at 10pm). This urine will not be collected. This voiding time will be recorded as the start time of the urine collection. Urine passed after this time during the night (if any) and until 8 am in the morning will be collected into a clean container. Subjects will empty their bladders a final time at 8 am in to the container. This voiding time will be recorded as the stop time of the urine collection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects to be included in the study are those who meet all of the following criteria:

             be eligible.

          2. Subjects must be pre-adolescent without any signs of puberty (acc. to Tanner scale).

          3. Subjects are in normal range for their age in height and weight. Weight and height
             measurements should fall within the percentile range 3-97-% of normal values for age
             according to Danish growth charts.

          4. Known history of mild intermittent or persistent reversible asthma for ≥ 3 months
             prior to the screening visit.

          5. Require:

               1. only inhaled SABA therapy (e.g. Bricanyl Turbuhaler) on an as required basis,
                  and/or

               2. Regular non-ICS controller medications for asthma (e.g., cromones or leukotriene
                  receptor antagonists) at a stable dose for ≥ 3 months prior to the screening
                  visit.

          6. No ICS for &gt;2 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          7. Demonstrates adequate spirometry technique and able to use a home PEFR meter.

          8. Demonstrated FEV1 of ≥ 80% predicted value at visit 1following appropriate withholding
             of asthma medications (if applicable) (no SABA use within 6 hours of the PFT).

          9. Demonstrated satisfactory technique in the use of the pMDI plus spacer and Autohaler
             devices.

         10. Must be continent of urine and willing to perform (with parental/guardian help)
             overnight urine collections.

         11. Willing and able to complete morning and evening PEFR measures with the help of a
             parent or guardian, if necessary, and attend all study visits.

         12. Willing and able to substitute pre-study prescribed inhaled asthma medication for the
             entire duration of the study with study medication.

         13. Written informed consent obtained as per national laws.

             Inclusion Criteria required following run-in:

             medication (no salbutamol Airomir Autohaler use within 6 hours of the PFT).

        Rescue medication use on ≤2 days during the last 7 days of the run in period. Exclusion
        Criteria

        Subjects to be excluded from the study are those who meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Require medications other than inhaled SABAs and/or regular non-ICS controller
             medications (e.g., cromones or leukotriene receptor antagonists) to maintain asthma
             control.

          2. ICS use within ≤ 2 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          3. Any asthma exacerbation of any severity for at least 3 months prior to the screening
             visit.

             laboratory tests, and physical examination that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             preclude entry into the study. &quot;Clinically significant&quot; is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk through study
             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.

         10. No major surgery requiring general anesthesia for at least 3 months prior to the
             screening visit.

         11. No febrile illnesses with temperature &gt; 39°C within a week of the screening visit.

         13. Significant, non-reversible active pulmonary disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis,
             bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).

         14. Subjects who have taken β- blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrythmics, or potent
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within 1 week prior to the screening visit.

         15. Current use of medications, other than those allowed in the protocol.

         16. Current evidence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test medications or
             components.
