    <textblock>
      This is a study of select drug therapies in patients with salivary gland cancer. The study
      has two phases: a molecular profiling phase (phase 1) and a treatment phase (phase 2).

      In molecular profiling phase of the study, participants will provide a sample of their tumor
      tissue to test for changes in certain genes that show whether certain drug treatments will be
      more useful than others.

      Once participants have undergone molecular profiling, they will be offered a drug treatment
      depending on the results. Certain drug treatments are designed to target certain gene
      changes. If there is a matching drug treatment, participants will be offered that treatment
      (either outside a clinical trial or within a clinical trial). If there are no gene changes or
      there are changes to genes were there are no drug treatments available for those certain
      changes, participants will be offered the study drug, Selinexor.

      Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. Research shows that one way cancer cells can grow
      uncontrollably is when certain proteins, called exporter proteins, are present in high levels
      in the body. These proteins prevent certain other proteins important in protecting cells from
      becoming cancerous and important in the controlling the growth of cells, from working. The
      study drug Selinexor is new class of drug called Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE)
      that blocks the exporter proteins from working which may allow the other proteins to work and
      slow or stop tumors from growing.
