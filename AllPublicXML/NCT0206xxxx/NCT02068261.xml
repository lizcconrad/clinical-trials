  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a computerized working memory
      training program on substance abuse, psychosocial functioning, cognitive performance and
      psychiatric problems in adults with substance abuse and attention problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effects of 5 weeks of computerized working
      memory training on substance abuse. Secondary aims are to explore whether effects are
      mediated by changes in executive functions and/or moderated by personality. Also, effects on
      measures of psychosocial functioning, depression, anxiety and attention will be explored.
      Follow-up assessment will be conducted at 6 months post training.
