  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study was conducted to investigate the effects of a high protein diet on the
      efficiency of energy use at rest and at low-levels of physical activity. The hypothesis was
      that a high intake of dietary protein would result in a less efficient use of energy in
      skeletal muscle in older adults.
