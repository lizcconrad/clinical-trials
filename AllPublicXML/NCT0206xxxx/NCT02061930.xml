  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to review the long-term soft tissue stability and the long-term
      esthetic results of single crowns supported by tissue level implants placed in non-augmented
      healed sites.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that tissue level implants can achieve ideal esthetic
      outcomes in non-augmented healed sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both successful implant-supported restorations and the peri-implant soft and hard tissues are
      vital determinants which may affect the short- and long-term aesthetic outcomes.

      For this reason, the pink aesthetic score (PES) was introduced for the evaluation of
      peri-implant soft tissues by FÃ¼rhauser in 2005 and modified by Belser as PES/WES in 2009.

      So far, a series of clinical studies have confirmed the suitability of PES/WES and PES index
      for the objective outcome assessment of the aesthetic dimension of anterior single-tooth
      implants.

      However, to our knowledge, studies with long term data of the aesthetic outcome evaluation in
      non-augmented healed sites of the anterior maxilla are still rare, for most of the papers
      published recently mainly focused on immediate implant placement after tooth extraction with
      only 1-5 years following up.

      In our previous study, we have evaluated the alterations of soft tissue around
      implant-supported single crowns in the anterior maxilla with original standard PES at the
      time of crown placement and 6 months post-loading .We have found that the aesthetic outcome
      of soft tissue around the single-tooth implant had improved significantly at follow-up
      compared with baseline according to PES assessment. However, the follow up time of the
      previous study was short (6-8 months), long time follow up is necessary to confirm the
      previous hypothesis and observations.

    <description>The photos were taken 1 hour after cementation of the crowns Digital camera will being used during the examinations (Nikon D70, Nikon Medical Objective circular flash; Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
The evaluation will be based on the pictures of the prosthesis and soft tissue around the crown which supported by implant.
7 parameters will be assessed for PES :mesial papilla, distal papilla, soft-tissue level, soft-tissue contour, alveolar process deficiency, soft-tissue color and texture.
5 parameters will be assessed for WES:general tooth form; outline and volume of the clinical crown; color; surface texture; and translucency and characterization.
For both PES and WES, the score of 2, 1, or 0 is assigned to each parameter by certain evaluation standard</description>

    <description>As routine postoperative examination, peri-apical radiographs were taken for all the patients with the long-cone technique at the time when the crowns were cemented. And the latest radiographs will be taken at the time of the last revisit. All of the radiographic films were scanned at 600 dpi with a scanner and the marginal bone level will be assessed with image analysis software.The distance between implant shoulder and first visible bone-to-implant contact (BID) will be measured on the mesial and distal aspects. For each implant and each examination period, the values will be calculated as the average of the obtained mesial and distal values.</description>

    <description>The implant placement procedures were planned based on clinical and radiographic evaluation. During the surgeries, the mid-crestal incision and intra-crevicular incision were made following local articaine infiltration anesthesia. No releasing incisions were made. After full-thickness flaps were elevated labially and lingually to expose the alveolar ridge, the implants were placed according to the standard surgical procedures defined by the manufacturer. After a healing time of 10-16 weeks, implant-level impressions were taken. The porcelain (Ivoclar-Vivadent AG, Schaan, Lichtenstein) fused to noble metal crowns were fabricated. Abutment screws were torqued to 15 Ncm. Crowns were cemented with HY-bond Glassionomer Cement</description>
