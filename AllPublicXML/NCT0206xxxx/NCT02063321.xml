      The aim of the study is to find out prevalence of diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients
      with diabetes mellitus in Slovak Republic.The outcome of the project will be epidemiology
      survey, prevalence of wet form of Diabetic Macular Edema in relation to duration of diabetes,
      type of diabetes, treatment (insulin vs. OAD or combination) etc. and identification of
      prognostic factors leading to development of DME.

      Epidemiological study, prospective, non-interventional

        1. Patient with history of diabetes ≥ 10 years or with suspected visual impairment will be
           enrolled and screened in NIED during hospitalization

        2. Anamnesis and history of diabetes, other co-morbidities, treatment will be recorded

        3. Patient undergo in NIED detailed diabetology examination and basic ophthalmology
           examination (best non-corrected visual acuity in ETDRS score and Amsler grid test)

        4. Patient undergo in NIED examination of the back of the eye using fundus camera to take
           images of retina to assess long-term changes of macula, optic disc, retina vessels and
           surrounding tissues

        5. The assessment of the ophthalmology examination will be carried out in one of two
           specialized reading centers - II. Eye Clinic SZU FNsP F.D.R., Banská Bystrica or OFTAL
           Specialized Hospital for Ophthalmology, Zvolen by Retina specialist

      The process of screening will be continuous, whilst each patient will sign an informed
      consent.

      Patients records will be stored electronically and data transmission between NIED and Reading
      Center will be protected using validated and secured software.
