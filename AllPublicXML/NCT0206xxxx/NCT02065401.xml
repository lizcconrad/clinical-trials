  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of deferitazole after
      administration of granule and tablet formulations of a deferitazole disodium salt to a
      capsule formulation of deferitazole magnesium hydroxide salt (reference formulation) in
      healthy adult subjects.
