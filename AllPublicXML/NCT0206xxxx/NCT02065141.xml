  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to validate a new method in healthy volunteers and those
      diagnosed with COPD and CHF that is able to measure protein digestion and absorption
      simultaneously. This method is used to quantify digestion and absorption in patients who are
      suspect of impaired digestion and absorption resulting in loss of nutrients.Findings may be
      used to develop treatment strategies to improve protein digestion and absorption in these
      patient groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves 1 screening visit of approximately 1-2 hours and 1 test day of
      approximately 8 hours. On the study day protein digestion and absorption will be measured
      using a mixture of amino acids that are made slightly heavier than normal, called stable
      isotopes. Subjects will receive feeding by sips to monitor changes in digestion and
      absorption, which can be picked up by stable isotope technology.
