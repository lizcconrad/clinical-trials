  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that switching kidney transplant patients on
      tacrolimus/sirolimus long-term maintenance immunosuppressive drug regimens to
      tacrolimus/everolimus, will not only be safe, but will lead to better kidney function than
      patients staying on tacrolimus/sirolimus due to the lower potential of everolimus to enhance
      calcineurin inhibitors toxicity and/or its ability to even reverse some of the negative
      effects of calcineurin inhibitors on vascular endothelial and kidney function. To test this
      hypothesis vascular endothelial biomarkers will be analyzed in blood plasma samples and
      kidney dysfunction biomarkers in urine samples via liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry to evaluate whether switching kidney transplant patients on tacrolimus/sirolimus
      to tacrolimus/everolimus will lead to better kidney and endothelial function after one year
      and two years.

          -  Pregnancy or inability of practicing acceptable contraceptive measures.

          -  Patients who have any surgical or medical condition, such as severe diarrhea, active
             peptic ulcer disease, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, which in the opinion of the
             investigator might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or
             excretion of study medication.
