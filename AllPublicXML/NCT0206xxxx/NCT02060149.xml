  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality of pneumonia with extensively drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) is
      still high, even if these patients received certain strong anti-infection treatment such us
      the combination of cefoperazone-sulbactam (C/S) and minocycline. Health airway lining fluid
      is mildly alkaline but airway acidification usually appears for the infection of XDRAB. The
      hypothesis is offered that the biologic activity of XDRAB might be inhibited if the
      circumstance including pH is changed. In the vitro study we observed that the inhibit effect
      of antibiotics on XDRAB growth was improved significantly by alkaline solution within the
      scope of physiology. So the aim of this clinical study is to explore the effects of
      nebulization of alkaline Solution on C/S plus minocycline on the pneumonia with XDRAB.

      Pneumonia patients with XDRAB are eligible for this multicenter study, do not meet the
      exclusion criteria and will sign the informed consent. They will received the anti-infection
      protocol with Cefoperazone/ sulbactam 3.0g（intravenous infusion, q8h or q6h) combined with
      minocycline doxycycline 100mg (oral, q12h). All enrolled patients were randomly divided into
      three groups according to the difference in pH value of aerosol inhalation with sodium
      bicarbonate solution. Group one is blank-control and patients will received usual antibiotic
      treatment without inhalation. The pH value in group two is 7.4 and that in group is 7.8. Each
      time the volume of aerosol solution is 5ml, q8h. The average course of treatment will be two
      weeks. Clinical indexes will be collected including vital signs, pulmonary rales, cough
      level, expectoration level, sputum color,blood count, arterial blood gas, biochemical
      parameters, chest X-ray score, APACHE II score, clinical pulmonary infection score, ECG,
      sputum culture, et al.The primary endpoints are pathogenic clearance rate and recovery rate.
      The secondary end point is adverse reaction rate.
