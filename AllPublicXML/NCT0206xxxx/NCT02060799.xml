      Braunwald defines dyspnoea as an abnormally uncomfortable awareness of breathing. Breathing
      discomfort, and its varying degrees of severity, is the one of the most disturbing symptoms
      patients can experience; and it is one of the main complaints in the patients presenting to
      the Emergency Department (ED). Dyspnea has a variety of underlying etiologies, like cardiac,
      pulmonary or metabolic etiologies or a combination of them, since several diseases can cause
      dyspnea like for instance heart failure (HF), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD).

      Acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS) is collectively defined as a gradual or rapid change in
      heart failure (HF) signs and symptoms resulting in a need for urgent therapy. Heart failure
      (HF) is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized
      world. The prevalence of symptomatic HF is estimated to range from 0.4 to 2.0% in general
      European population. The incidence increases rapidly with age, and in Europe.
      Characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of HF patients admitted to
      hospital have been adequately described, in Europe and in the United States. The Euro Heart
      Failure Survey (EHFS) I with 11 327 patients described the demographics of acutely
      hospitalized HF patients. The ADHERE registry has data on over 100 000 hospitalizations for
      AHF from the USA. In-hospital mortality was 4 and 7%, in ADHERE and EHFS I, respectively.

      This same sensation of breathlessness is what also drives patients with asthma and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to the ED. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      exacerbation accounts for approximately 1.5 million ED visits in the United States per year.
      It is the third most common cause of hospitalization, with an estimated 726 000
      hospitalizations in 2000 in the USA. Previous studies have demonstrated important differences
      between guideline recommendations and actual management of COPD exacerbation, either in the
      ED or during hospitalization.

      The diagnosis in front of a dyspneic patient in the ED remains a challenge, because of a low
      sensitivity of the clinical signs associated with the aging of the population and the variety
      of underlying diseases. Little is known about the Epidemiology of dyspneic patients in the ED
      at the European level. Diagnosis, prevalence and treatment of the patients may vary among
      European countries.

      MAIN OBJECTIVES

        -  Epidemiologic description of patients presenting to the ED with shortness of breath as
           main complaint.

        -  Description of current management in the ED of patients presenting to the ED with
           shortness of breath as main complaint.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Sub analysis of ED discharged patients versus admitted patients for characteristics,
           comparison to recommended care and re-ED visit.

        -  Determine clinical and/or biological criteria to distinguish between:

             -  Patients who are treated as outpatients and admitted patients.

             -  Patients hospitalized in ward and patients admitted to intensive care units (CCU
                and ICU)

        -  Prognostic prediction, using clinical and biochemical data

        -  To determine if ED patients treated for acute heart failure differ from those admitted
           to hospital.

        -  Comparison of European data characteristics, investigation, treatment and outcome to
           similar data in other part of the world.
