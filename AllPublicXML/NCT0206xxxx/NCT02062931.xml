      Stem cells (SC) are the foundation cells for every organ, tissue and cell in the body. They
      are undifferentiated &quot;blank&quot; cells that do not yet have a specific function. Under proper
      conditions, they begin to develop into specialized tissue and organs. They are
      self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the
      remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. They serves as a
      sort of repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish
      other cells as long as the person is still alive. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the loss
      of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid
      deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility and elevated serum gonadotropins. POF occurs in 1 % of
      women. In majority of cases the underlying cause is not identified. Management essentially
      involves hormone replacement and infertility treatment. This work aimed to evaluate the
      therapeutic potential of Autologous MSC transplantation in women suffering from Premature
      Ovarian Failure.

      Sample of 60 ml is aspirated from the bone marrow of the iliac crest and prepared in the lab
      and injected in the ovaries through laparoscopy. Endometrial fractional biopsy was taken,
      stained with H&amp;E stain and by IH staining by stem cell marker OCT4. Immunohistochemical
      expression of stem cell marker OCT4 was evaluated before and after transplantation according
      to Edessy Stem Cell Scoring (ESS). Participants were followed up monthly for a period of six
      months by hormonal (FSH, LH and E2), clinical (resuming menstruation), US (folliculometry),
      histopathological (HP), and IH expression of stem cell marker OCT4 of the endometrial biopsy
      (stem cell positivity according to ESS) outcome.
