  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that obese people are more sensitive to sensory and rewarding effects
      of food, aspects that mediate food preferences and intake. Individuals that underwent
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery frequently report changes in food preference. They indicate
      a decreased preference for highly rewarding energy dense foods. Changes in food preference
      might be related to alterations in central (brain) mechanisms, related to reward sensing. The
      smell and sight of food can be considered as anticipatory cues for the rewarding effects of
      food intake. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of gastric bypass surgery on
      (alterations in) food preferences. Secondly, this study aims at assessing the effect of
      gastric bypass surgery on the brain reward response when exposed to sight and smell of food
      stimuli with different sugar and fat contents.

    <description>Two weeks before and two months after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass the brain reward response to the sight and smell of food will be assessed in a subset of 30 participants.</description>

    <measure>Plasma levels of endocannabinoids and satiety hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and 2 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Two weeks before and two months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, fasted plasma levels of endocannabinoids, ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin and Glucagon-Like Peptide will be assessed in a subset of 30 participants.</description>

    <description>General subject characteristics, e.g. age, gender, restrained eating score and other lifestyle and medical parameters.
For the subset of 30 patients that participate in the fMRI measurements: disinhibition scores will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Olfactory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>At each fMRI measurement, i.e., before and two months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Sniffin' Sticks test will be used to assess olfactory performance in the subset of 30 participants that will participate in the fMRI measurements. The sum-score of threshold, discrimination and identification tests will be used to determine if a participant is normosmic. A score of &gt; 30 indicates a participant is normosmic.</description>
