      The purpose is to assess the safety and feasibility of cellular therapy derived from bone
      marrow, to help bone healing in patients with avascular necrosis of the hip.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and feasibility of an in situ single injection of a high dose of
      autologous bone marrow-derived, in vitro expanded Mesenchymal stem cells, and its
      contribution to the resolution of the early stages of avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral
      head.
