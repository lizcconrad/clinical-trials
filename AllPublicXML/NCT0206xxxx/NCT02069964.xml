  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with head and neck cancer or benign tumours of the head and neck receive
      radiotherapy to their neck as part of their treatment. The large arteries in the neck, the
      carotid arteries, are often included in the area being treated with radiotherapy. There is
      some evidence to show that radiotherapy to these blood vessels can result in thickening and
      furring of the artery walls some years after treatment. This thickening may then result in
      stiffening and narrowing of the artery.

      Current research is now aimed towards detecting radiotherapy-related changes to the carotid
      arteries at an earlier stage and towards using new radiotherapy techniques to avoid treating
      these blood vessels if possible. The question of whether or not the use of preventive
      medicines like aspirin and cholesterol-lowering tablets helps to reverse this process is
      currently unanswered.

      The aim of this study is to compare the thickness (intima-medial thickness) of the carotid
      artery wall over time (a period of 5 years) following radiotherapy to the thickness in
      carotid arteries that have not received radiotherapy. There are many other causes for
      thickening of arteries (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and diabetes)
      and these may affect the ability to measure the effect of radiotherapy change to the artery
      wall. In order to address this, it is ideal to look at this process in patients who are
      having only one side of the neck treated and use the other side as a comparison. The study
      will also be investigating for earlier signs of radiotherapy-related changes, such as
      stiffening of the artery wall, inflammation in the artery wall (a very early sign of
      radiotherapy-related change) and some markers in the blood that may indicate that this
      process is taking place.

      The null hypotheses of this study are:

        -  In irradiated carotid arteries, mean intimal-medial thickness at one year following
           radiotherapy will be the same as in unirradiated arteries.

        -  The incidence of carotid artery stenosis will be the same in irradiated and unirradiated
           carotid arteries

        -  Arterial wall strain at one year following radiotherapy will be the same in irradiated
           and unirradiated carotid arteries.

        -  Microbubble ultrasound will not be able to detect Inflammation in the carotid arteries
           during radiotherapy as an early marker of atherosclerosis; microbubble ultrasound will
           not demonstrate at what dose of radiotherapy inflammation begins.

        -  Serum biomarker levels will not increase over time from baseline after radiotherapy and
           won't correlate to IMT and arterial strain.
