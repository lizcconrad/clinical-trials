  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) using biventricular pacing (BiVP) is established as
      an effective treatment for heart failure. Unfortunately up to 45% of patients do not respond,
      with no improvement in symptoms or cardiac size. Reducing the proportion of non-responders
      has become the key research focus in CRT.

      Targeting the position of the left ventricular (LV) pacing lead within the coronary vein
      network has previously been shown to increase the proportion of responders to CRT. Several
      techniques have been tried for targeting lead position, of which the best investigated are
      the use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to target the lead position to the site of
      latest mechanical activation of the left ventricle, and the use of invasive monitoring to
      select the pacing site at which the greatest acute haemodynamic response (AHR) to BiVP
      occurs. Both techniques are limited by groups of patients in whom the techniques are not
      possible or provide limited useful information.

      The relationship between these two measures is unknown - there are no previous studies that
      have investigated correlation between the site of latest mechanical activation determined by
      echo and the site of maximal AHR. It is likely that a hybrid technique using both of these
      investigations might allow optimal lead positioning in more patients, or that if the
      information is shown to be equivalent, more streamlined techniques can be designed.

      This study will also be able to contribute towards several important secondary questions. In
      particular the investigators will study the possibility of using non-invasive cardiac output
      monitoring (NICOM) to assess haemodynamic response rather than an intravascular pressure
      monitor wire. The investigators also wish to assess whether the site of latest mechanical
      activation is changed by right ventricular pacing.
