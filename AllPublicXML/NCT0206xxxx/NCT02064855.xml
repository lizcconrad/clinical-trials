    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate fusion status and patient outcomes observed from use
      of the VESUVIUS Demineralized Fibers with the EVEREST Spinal System as compared to the
      literature reported outcomes of spinal fusion using autograft with posterior stabilization.

             steroid use

          -  Known allergy to titanium or cobalt chrome

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease or a systemic disorder such as HIV,

             disease, alcohol or drug addiction) that would interfere with patient self-assessment
             of function, pain, or quality of life.

          -  Involved in current or pending spinal litigation where permanent disability benefits
             are being sought

          -  Incarcerated at the time of study enrollment
