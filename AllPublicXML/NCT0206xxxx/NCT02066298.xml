    <textblock>
      Because approximately half of all mild-moderately-severe asthma is persistently
      non-eosinophilic, it is important to determine prospectively if patients who are persistently
      non-eosinophilic differ in their benefit from inhaled corticosteroid treatment compared to
      patients who are not persistently non-eosinophilic.

      SIENA is a 42-week randomized, stratified, 3-period double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
      study of patients with symptomatic mild-to-moderate asthma, not already taking an inhaled
      corticosteroid, in whom the effect of &quot;medium-dose&quot; inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) will be
      compared with the effect of placebo and with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LMA).

    <measure>The primary outcome is a composite measure that uses treatment failures, asthma control days, and percent predicted FEV1.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of 12-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>This composite outcome uses a hierarchical method to ascertain differences in asthma control. For each participant, treatments are first compared to see if they differ in terms of treatment failures. If one treatment results in no treatment failures and another treatment does, it is deemed the superior treatment and no further comparisons are made. If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by treatment failures, then they are compared by asthma control days (ACDs). If one treatment yields at least 31 annualized ACDs more than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority still cannot be assigned by ACDs, then they are compared by percent predicted FEV1 at the end of a treatment period. If one treatment yields at least 5% greater FEV1 than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by exacerbations, ACDs or FEV1, then that participant is classified as having no differential response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment failure</measure>
    <time_frame>End of 12-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Failure includes:
Awakening from asthma three or more times in a two-week period or on two consecutive nights, or
Using albuterol for relief of symptoms four or more times/day for two or more consecutive days, or
Albuterol has been relieving symptoms for less than four hours after each treatment over a 12-hour period, or
Using albuterol for relief of symptoms daily for seven days, and this use exceeds two times the weekly use of albuterol in the baseline period, or
exercise induces unusual breathlessness</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Days</measure>
    <time_frame>End of 12-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma Control Days are based on patient completed electronic daily diaries, and are defined as: A day with no rescue albuterol use (pre-exercise albuterol will not be counted), no non-study asthma medications, no daytime asthma symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, phlegm/mucus rated as mild, moderate or severe, or cough rated as moderate or severe), no nighttime asthma symptoms, no unscheduled healthcare visits for asthma, and no PEF &lt; 80% of predetermined baseline.</description>
