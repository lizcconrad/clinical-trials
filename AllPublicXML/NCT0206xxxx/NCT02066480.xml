  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by skeletal fragility due to decreased bone mass and
      deterioration of bone microarchitecture , leading to increased fracture risk for low trauma,
      such as spinal fractures or femoral neck .

      It is estimated that 3 million people are living in France , particularly women , with an
      incidence that increases with age .

      This disease is a major public health issue in terms of morbidity and mortality , costs and
      risk of recurrence (after a first fracture episode) , including risk factors are identified.

      However, although bone densitometry is a reliable diagnostic tool and preventive treatments
      are at our disposal, screening for osteoporosis is still insufficient .

      The objective of our study is to improve the detection of osteoporosis in Hospital
      Departmental Vendee , using a simple questionnaire seeking risk factors followed by bone
      densitometry or if risk factors are found. Based on the results , the patient will be sent in
      rheumatology consultation for implementation of treatment if necessary .

      Therefore included women hospitalized in medical services , gynecology, surgery and
      orthopedics Hospital Departmental Vendee , aged 50 to 80 years. Will not be included women
      who could answer a simple questionnaire and those previously treated for osteoporosis or have
      already received a bone density there is less than 3 years old .
