      Circa-annual variations in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have been well established,
      and there also seems to be an effect of season on bone turnover and bone mass. been shown
      that bone turnover follows a circa-annual rhythm. On the basis of human clinical results, it
      was suggested that adipose tissue functions as a vitamin D buffering system that to a certain
      extent prevents uncontrolled synthesis of 25(OH)D in the liver. Directly related to this
      issue is the question of how much vitamin D is needed to ensure target serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. According to the recommended dietary
      allowances, persons should achieve &quot;levels of intake of essential nutrients considered to be
      adequate to meet the known nutritional needs of practically all healthy persons&quot; Moreover it
      is important to note that the significant percentage of the population is temporarily of
      continuously deficient in vitamin D. In the similar condition of vitamin D deficiency, the
      aetiology is very different since only as almost exclusively as a consequence of a primary
      disease in children it is manifested: hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent among children on
      renal substitution therapy, regardless of the type of therapy used and the stage of renal
      failure.

      The rationale providing high dose strengths of vitamin D based on an assumption of better
      compliance especially in adult with senior age patients; also a potential for faster
      resolution of vitamin D deficiency, since utilization of cholecalciferol is higher when
      patients had low levels of 25(OH)D, and vice versa, there is a plateau phase when close to
      normal range (Vieth 2001).

      According to clinical data, a doses equivalent of daily 1000 IU, (7000 IU per week, or 30000
      IU per month) is considered as a minimal effective dose to treat vitamin D deficiency. The
      treatment of vitamin D with a duration of 30 days may result and increase of 6-12.5 nmol/L.
      With the deficiency criteria considered as &lt;20 ng/ml, the vitamin supplementation is
      indicative, the treatment dosages should be adjusted to the increase planned to achieve the
      mid-normal range.

      As the base of calculations, the doses of 40 IU results in an increase of 0.4 ng/ml in a
      period of 60 days. Accordingly 1000 IU in a period of 2-5 month resulted in an increase of
      approx 10 ng/ml. The risk of overdose in relatively low, since the absorption and the
      metabolic path is well controlled: automatic mechanisms downregulation at normal ranges.

      In this study the there are three groups in the similar daily dose equivalent of 1000 IU/day.
      The absorption of daily , weekly and monthly dosing should have a buffered effect due to the
      body adipose tissues, balancing the daily 1,25(OH)D levels, and moreover to provide a
      biological reservoir. The three doses are considered as comparable in efficacy and safety.

      The fourth group is intended to utilize the expanded dose range of 4286 IU/ day, using the
      30.000 IU tablets on a weekly dosing schedule. This group is to demonstrate the efficacy of
      higher doses to normalize the vitamin D levels, within a reasonable timeframe of 60-90 days.
