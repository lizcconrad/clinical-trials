  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute bilateral pulmonary
      infiltrates and impairment of oxygen uptake. For example, pneumonia can cause the development
      of ARDS. Despite modern intensive care treatment, mortality in ARDS patients remains high
      (40%). Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is the mainstay of ARDS treatment. Controlled MV
      is the conventional ventilation strategy to ensure lung protective ventilation (low tidal
      volumes) and recovery of the lungs. However, among disadvantages of controlled MV are the
      development of respiratory muscle atrophy (due to disuse) and the need for high dose
      sedatives to prevent patient-ventilator asynchrony. The use of high doses of sedatives and
      respiratory muscle weakness are associated with increased morbidity, worse clinical outcomes
      and prolonged MV.

      Besides controlled MV, a patient can be ventilated with supported ventilation. Supported MV
      decreases the likelihood to develop muscle atrophy, improves oxygenation and hemodynamics,
      and lowers consumption of sedatives. However potential disadvantages of supported ventilation
      include generation of too high tidal volumes, especially in patients with high respiratory
      drive. A previous study in healthy subjects has shown that titration of neuromuscular
      blocking agent (NMBA) can decrease activity of inspiratory muscles, while maintaining
      adequate ventilation. It is hypothesized that low dose NMBA may enable supported MV with
      adequate tidal volumes, in patients with high respiratory drive.
