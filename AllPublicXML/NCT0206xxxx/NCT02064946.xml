  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a high-dose vitamin D supplementation
      regimen in reducing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-related side effects in older prostate
      cancer patients on ADT. The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, controlled
      clinical trial that will accrue 76 prostate cancer patients without severe bone loss, aged 60
      and older, beginning ADT, and scheduled to receive at least 6 months more of ADT.
      Participants will be randomized to: 1) weekly high-dose vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) or 2) vitamin
      D placebo only for a period of 24 weeks. Both groups will also receive a daily multivitamin
      and calcium supplement.

      The investigators hypothesize high-dose vitamin D supplementation will reduce androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT)-related side effects including ADT-induced bone loss, decreased
      muscle mass, falls, reduced muscle strength, and diminished physical performance in older
      prostate cancer patients. The vitamin D supplementation is aimed at reducing fracture risk by
      maintaining proper bone density, thereby preventing osteoporotic/osteopenic conditions and
      increasing muscle mass. Both vitamin D and exercise are efficacious in maintaining proper
      bone health and muscle mass among the general population, but little research has been done
      on prostate cancer patients and survivors. Vitamin D could reduce fracture risk among
      prostate cancer survivors.
