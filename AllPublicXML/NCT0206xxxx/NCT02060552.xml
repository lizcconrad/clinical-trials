      The aim of study was to assess the efficiency and safety of oral IL-1βinhibitor in
      combination with urate lowering therapy on joint pain intensity,urate control, global
      assessments of disease activity, self-monitored gouty acute flare times, inflammatory markers
      and symptoms improving related life quantity in gouty patients.

      This was a randomized single-dose, open-label and active-controlled study which was carried
      out in 96 primary gout patients. Subjects and doctors have no access to randomization
      sequence which is determined by the primary investigator.All patients received an open-label
      febuxostat 40mg daily during the whole study. Healthy control were 32 age-matched men from
      volunteers in the medical health center.Two primary end points included pain intensity
      measurement which was recorded at each visit and subsequently acute flare times which was
      recorded at home and reported to investigator.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' intensity of pain was assessed at each visit by a single question using a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain question was how much pains have you had because of your illness in the past seven days? The two anchors were no pain (0 score) and unbearable pain (score of 100). Patients were instructed to draw a vertical mark on the scaleline and the investigator measured the length and recorded the result.</description>

    <measure>Acute gout flare times</measure>

    <description>Acute gout flare was defined by pain, redness, swelling, and warmth on joints or adjacent soft tissue and pain VAS more than 3.0. For subsequent gout flares, subjects were recorded events by themselves and were reported to investigator whether they had any new or recurrent gout flares since their last visit</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants who were allocated to the study all had a history of taking tolerable and
        adequate dose of urate lowering therapy including febuxostat 40-80mg daily or allopurinol
        200-300 mg daily for at least 4 weeks and were defined as difficult to treat or refractory
        gout patients. All patients had a negative of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody,
        Hb&gt;100g/L, total leukocyte count≥3.5×109, PLT≥80×109, serum creatinine&lt;133umol/L,
        transaminases&lt;60U/L and fasting urate≥6.0mg/dL.

        Inclusion criteria for the gouty patients were age≥18 years old, BMI(18-30kg/m2). All
        participants enrolled in our study fulfilled American College of Rheumatology criteria for
        primary gout.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria included secondary gout (because it is always associated with some
        underlying renal disease), a history of congestive heart failure, serum
        creatinine≥133umol/L (because the patients have underlying risks if NSAID needed) or the
        use of glucocorticoid&gt;15mg daily,colchicine, uricosuric drugs, chemotherapy or
        immunosuppressive therapy in the past three months.
