             days (defined as greater than or equal to 7 consecutive days)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to aspirin and/or omega-3 fatty acids

          -  Actively receiving a physician-directed regimen of aspirin and/or receiving
             herapeutic/prophylactic anticoagulation

          -  Any aspirin or omega-3 free fatty acid supplementation within the last 14 days
