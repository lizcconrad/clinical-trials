      The study will evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy on skin comfort of F#1048-082 soothing
      cream used just after injection procedure and also the tolerance and the efficacy of the
      F#841-020 anti-age cream on aging parameters compared to baseline and to the F#1374-002
      placebo cream (comparison within subjects - half face method) to identify additional benefits
      delivered by the product compared to a cosmetic procedure.

           CM-2600d.

        -  Photographic documentation: Canfield imaging station equipped with visible, polarized,
           fluorescence and UV light and with specific lighting for shadows.

      Second study phase (anti-age activity vs placebo):

        -  Clinical and self grading (visual analogic scale) :

             1. Forehead wrinkles (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            11. Neck wrinkles (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            12. Lines on the neck opening (0= no wrinkle to 10= severe wrinkles)

            13. Skin firmness (0= very firm skin to 10= no firm skin)

            14. Skin elasticity (0= very elastic skin to 10= no elastic skin)

            15. Sagging skin (0= no sagging skin to 10= severe sagging skin)

            16. Radiance (0= very radiant skin to 10= no radiant skin)

            17. Smoothness (0= very smooth skin to 10= no smooth skin)

            18. Skin softness (0= very soft skin to 10= no soft skin)

            19. Colour evenness (0= good evenness to 10= bad evenness)

            20. Skin tone (0= good complexion to 10= bad complexion)

        -  Optical colorimetry: measurement of skin colour (L*a*b*) by Spectrophotometer CM-2600d.

        -  Photographic documentation: Canfield imaging station equipped with visible, polarized,
           fluorescence and UV light and with specific lighting for shadows.

        -  Skin replicas and profilometry at level of crow's feet (image analysis of: total surface
           of the wrinkles, mean length of the wrinkles, total length of the wrinkles, number of
           the wrinkles)

        -  Skin elasticity measurement by suction (CutometerÂ®)

      Tolerance evaluation (investigator's judgement):

      At each evaluation time, the investigator considering the appearance of possible adverse
      effects related to the tested creams and all comments reported by the subjects on diary card
      will judge the tolerance of the products under study.

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>For 7 days after injections (from T0 to T7d/T0'') the soothing cream will be applied twice a day on the full face and neck insisting on injection areas. 5 visits will be performed: a pre-test visit (T-30 subjects' screening), a baseline visit (T0 intradermal implant execution/ T0' evaluations just after the aesthetic procedure/ Timm evaluations immediately after the 1st soothing cream application), 2 intermediate visits (T1d, T3d - 1 and 3 days after injections) and a final visit (T7d - 7 days after the aesthetic procedure). Product tolerance (number of participants with adverse events) and efficacy:
clinical and self grading (performed on injection areas by VAS score)
optical colorimetry (on nasolabial folds - L*a*b*)
photographic documentation (of all the face) will be performed at each study time.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The anti-age product will be applied once a day, in the evening, on half face and neck, for 12 weeks and the placebo cream in the morning with the same modalities. On the contralateral face side (according to a previous randomisation list), the volunteers will apply the placebo cream twice a day.
5 visits will be performed: a baseline visit (T0 - before aesthetic procedure), a visit 7 days after injection (T0''/T7d), 2 intermediate visits (T4W and T8W - 4 and 8 weeks after the first study product application) and a final visit (T12W - 12 weeks after the first study product application).
Tolerance (number of participants with adverse events) and efficacy:
clinical and self grading on face and neck (by VAS score)
optical colorimetry on both cheeks (L*a*b*)
photographic documentation of all the face
skin elasticity on both cheeks (deformation-mm)
wrinkles profilometry on the lateral corner of the eyes (micron) will be evaluated at each study time.</description>
