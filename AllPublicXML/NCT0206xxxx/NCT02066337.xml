  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of locally delivered ozone gel as an adjunct to conventional
      periodontal therapy on selected clinical parameters as well as alveolar bone density (BD) and
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in patient with chronic periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators tested the effect of ozone gel as a local delivery system in
      treatment of chronic periodontitis in term of probing pocket depth reduction, mean gain in
      clinical attachment level, a more rise in BD values as well as greater reduction in SOD
      activity compared to scaling and root planing (SRP) alone.
