      Assess the safety and feasibility of local oncological drug delivery into the bronchial wall
      after recanalization of subjects with malignant airway obstruction. Safety and feasibility
      (technical success) will be assessed.

      This localized delivery is intended as an adjunct therapy and all subjects will receive
      standard of care oncology therapy as determined by their treating physicians.

             recanalization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Second primary malignancy, except for non-melanoma skin cancer and in situ cervical
             cancer

          -  Pregnant or nursing female subjects, or female subjects of child bearing potential who
             refuse to take a pregnancy test prior to their enrollment in this study

          -  Uncontrolled infection

          -  Presence or recent history of any systemic disorder or conditions, such as:

               -  uncontrolled hypertension

               -  type 1 diabetes

               -  severe pulmonary hypertension

             investigational medical devices

          -  Other (non-cancer) disease not stabilized within 1 month before the Screening Visit

          -  Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel, Cremophor EL, or iodinated contrast media

          -  Any serious, uncontrolled comorbidity or condition that an Investigator believes would
             interfere with the intent of the study or would make participation not in the best
             interest of the patient Intraoperative Exclusion Criteria

          -  Use of pulmonary airway stents and/or ongoing or initiation of local external beam or
             brachytherapy radiation

          -  Any intraoperative complications that per the investigator's judgment increase the
             risk to the patient.
