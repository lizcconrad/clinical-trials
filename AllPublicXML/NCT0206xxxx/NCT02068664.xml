    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if stroke survivors with aphasia have spatial
      neglect (Phase 1). If they are determined to have the condition Phase 2 will be offered:
      which is prism adaptation treatment. This is a pilot study that will be performed with 4-5
      subjects.

      Spatial neglect is a disorder that may occur after a brain injury such as stroke. Spatial
      neglect may affect stroke recovery. One example of this heterogeneous condition: Individuals
      with spatial neglect often pay more attention to one side of what they are looking at, even
      though they have no difficulty seeing. The study investigators would like to screen stroke
      survivors with aphasia because they may also have spatial neglect (right neglect after left
      hemisphere stroke), which is said by the literature to occur in 25% of cases. If it is
      identified, a treatment approach will be offered, to attempt to remediate the condition using
      prism goggles, following a prism treatment protocol based on previous studies.

    <description>Prism goggles shift the image one sees toward the left (because the thicker portion of the glass lens is on the right). This will change the perception of where the image is in space, causing the person to adapt. The after-effects of the treatment is what is important. It has been shown to make it easier for people to move in the right space (if have right neglect) or improves ability to complete other functional tasks.</description>
