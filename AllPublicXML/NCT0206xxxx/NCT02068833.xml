    <textblock>
      Favorable effects of bariatric surgery have been demonstrated in particular regarding
      increased insulin sensitivity, decreased blood pressure, improved blood lipids and decreased
      cardiovascular risk. After surgery, weight loss also leads to improvement of the chronic
      inflammatory state related to obesity, a strong predictor of the metabolic status. Although
      obese patients are often affected with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, both related to
      renal impairment, the existence of a distinct mechanism by which obesity would cause chronic
      renal insufficiency has been suggested. The mechanisms underlying obesity-related nephropathy
      have been proposed to involve hyperfiltration, expansion of mesangial cells, hyperperfusion
      leading to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, as noted in obese dogs. In humans,
      improvements in renal function may be observed following bariatric surgery, although some
      reported a possibility of increased nephrolithiases. Whether biliopancreatic diversion and
      gastrectomy alone have similar effects is uncertain. More prospective studies are needed to
      assess the impact of all types of weight loss surgery to reverse chronic renal insufficiency.

      The objective of this study is to document changes in microalbuminuria and metabolic
      parameters in patients with altered renal function undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients
      enrolled in the study will show renal function impairment as demonstrated by
      albumin/creatinine ratio alterations in 2 out of 3 measurements taking place before surgery.
      We will perform a prospective study of renal function markers (albumin/creatinine ratio) and
      metabolic parameters (blood lipids, glucose, insulin, inflammatory markers) before and 6, 12,
      24 months after surgery in patients with microalbuminuria at study onset (albumin/creatinine
      ratio 2.0-20.0 mg/mmol in men and 2.8-28.0 mg/mmol in women). Data will be analysed with
      repeated measures analyses in both subgroup. Thereafter, a linear regression model will be
      created to adjust for potentially confounding factors such as hypertension and diabetes. We
      hypothesize that patients with severe obesity and altered renal function, whether they are
      diabetic or not, have improved microalbuminuria and metabolic parameters following
      biliopancreatic diversion with sleeve gastrectomy or sleeve gastrectomy alone. The extent of
      renal function recovery will correlate directly with metabolic improvements.

        (albumin/creatinine ratio between 2.0 and 20.0 mg/mmol in men and between 2.8 and 28.0
        mg/mmol in women) planned to undergo either biliopancreatic diversion with sleeve
        gastrectomy or sleeve gastrectomy alone.
