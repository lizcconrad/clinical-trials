      Evaluate the effectiveness of virtual therapy and conventional physiotherapy in spastic
      muscles of patients with sequelae of stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considered the second most frequent cause of death worldwide , the stroke is also responsible
      for the largest number of functional disability in individuals. The socio - economic hardship
      that many patients face to perform a program of intensive rehabilitation sensorimotor, has
      led to functional limitations in many cases , promote irreversible consequences. Spasticity
      in the upper and lower limb after stroke results in loss of function and mobility being the
      key therapeutic approaches in order to restore its function. Currently, the Virtual therapy
      has been used in physical therapy, demonstrating safety, feasibility and potential to
      facilitate the effective rehabilitation treatment, promoting motor recovery. The objective of
      this study is to analyze and compare the effectiveness of virtual therapy and conventional
      physiotherapy in paretic upper and lower limbs of patients with sensory motor deficit after
      stroke. Virtual therapy will be based on a custom application using virtual reality
      projection, and conventional treatment will be based on cinesiotherapy for members upper and
      lower paretic. The evaluation will be performed by biomedical instrumentation using
      dynamometry, electromyography and analysis from functional movement. Statistical differences
      are based on t test with significance level of p 0 , 05 . As a result expected -
      scientifically proven the effectiveness of this new form of treatment aimed at improving
      quality of life and functional independence of patients with neurological sequel.

    <description>It is believed that this study achieves positive results regarding the adequacy of muscle tone associated with musculoskeletal better performance, so that the muscles normotônicos gain strength and overcome the resistance of the hypertonic muscles, improving range of motion and harmony of the affected limbs, leading the consequent improvement of balance and gait, after application of virtual therapy.</description>
