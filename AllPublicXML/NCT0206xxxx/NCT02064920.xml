  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether the Cogstate testing battery can detect improvements in
      cognitive function in participants with mild AD. The primary hypothesis is that for one of
      the Cogstate battery tests, One Card Learning (OCL), the standard deviation associated with
      the change from baseline in OCL measurements after 12 weeks of donepezil and placebo
      treatments is =&lt;0.1

    <description>OCL is one of the Cogstate battery of tests, and is a continuous visual recognition task that assesses visual recognition, memory and attention using a pattern separation algorithm. OCL is a score defined as the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses to 80 OCL questions. The score ranges from 0 to 1.5708 where a higher score means better performance.</description>

    <description>OCL is one of the Cogstate battery of tests, and is a continuous visual recognition task that assesses visual recognition, memory and attention using a pattern separation algorithm. The percentage of correct responses to 80 OCL questions is defined as the number of correct responses x 100 divided by the number of total responses; and ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 is best, and 0 is the worst outcome.</description>

        <description>OCL is one of the Cogstate battery of tests, and is a continuous visual recognition task that assesses visual recognition, memory and attention using a pattern separation algorithm. The percentage of correct responses to 80 OCL questions is defined as the number of correct responses x 100 divided by the number of total responses; and ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 is best, and 0 is the worst outcome.</description>
