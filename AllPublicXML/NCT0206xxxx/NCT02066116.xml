  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed the kinect-based upper extremity rehabilitation program and
      designed this protocol to prove the efficacy of this program.

      In brief, subacute stroke patients allocated to intervention group will receive the kinect
      based-rehabilitation program plus conventional occupational therapy and patients allocated to
      control group will receive the sham virtual rehabilitation plus conventional occupational
      therapy, for 10 days.

      20 patients with subacute stroke will be allocated into each group and after completing the
      10 days intervention, they will be assessed by using objective assessment tools for upper
      extremity function.

    <description>This is composed of 6 stages. Higher score means better function. The description for each stage as follows.
Flaccidity: no voluntary movement.
Synergies or minimal voluntary movement.
Synergies performed voluntary (spasticity gratest).
Some deviation from synergy.
Independent or isolated movement.
Individual joint movement nearly normal with minimal spasticity.</description>

    <measure>Box and Block Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks after the baseline, 6 weeks after the baseline, 14 weeks after the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are seated at a table, facing a rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments of equal dimension by means of a partition.
One hundred and fifty, 2.5 cm, colored, wooden cubes or blocks are placed in one compartment or the other.
The individual is instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other for a period of 60 seconds.
The BBT is scored by counting the number of blocks carried over the partition from one compartment to the other during the one-minute trial period.</description>
