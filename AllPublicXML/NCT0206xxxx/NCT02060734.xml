      This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of lidocaine
      injection of trigger points versus subcutaneous injection in patients with subacute whiplash
      associated disorder following injury. Outcomes include pain, objective assessment,
      self-report function recovery, impact on work performance and globe perceived effects which
      will be assessed 5 minutes, 2 and 6 weeks following injection.
