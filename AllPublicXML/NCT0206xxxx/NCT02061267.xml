  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome may be defined as the constellation of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      risk factors that comprises obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Lack of
      habitual physical activity and certain dietary patterns, including high-saturated fatty acids
      (SFA) intake, contribute to increase the risk of CVD, whereas the greatest risk reduction is
      related with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), mainly from olive oil, and omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Vitamin B3, as a major substrate for nicotinamide
      phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), has also emerged as a nutritional intervention strategy
      for prevention of CVD.

      NAMPT has been shown to exert activities of central importance to cellular energetics and
      innate immunity. Within the cell, NAMPT is the rate-limiting step in a salvage pathway of
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis. By virtue of this role, it can
      regulate cellular levels of NAD+ and thereby NAD+-consuming enzymes. NAMPT is also released
      by a variety of cells, and elevated levels can be found in the systemic circulation of
      subjects with a range of inflammatory disorders.

      Recent evidences suggest that, primarily due to its high MUFA content, olive oil is useful as
      an optimal fat for the modulation of CVD risk factors in the postprandial state. In addition,
      NAMPT has been shown to correlate with triglycerides in the fasting plasma, and a potential
      regulatory role for fatty acids on NAMPT expression has been proposed.

      The global aim of the project is to assess whether olive oil (MUFA), compared to other
      dietary fatty acids (SFA and omega-3 PUFA) and in association with vitamin B3 could have
      benefits on NAMPT-related inflammation and atherosclerosis. We hope to provide important
      novel insights on the relationship among dietary fatty acids, NAD+ metabolism, and metabolic
      syndrome. This aim is expected to be achieved in one principal objective:

      To elucidate the influence of olive oil (MUFA), butter (SFA) or fish oil (omega-3 PUFA) meals
      supplemented by vitamin B3 on postprandial NAMPT modulation and its involvement on leukocyte
      inflammatory response in subjects with metabolic syndrome.

    <description>Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglyceride, and NEFA levels in plasma will be measured at several time-points postprandially (t = 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h) using routine biochemical procedures. Different empiric indices of postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity will be determined.</description>

    <description>Inflammatory markers will be measured in plasma at several time-points postprandially (t = 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h) using appropriate methods (EIA, ELISA, and/or Bioplex multiplex system), and will include NAMPT, the acute phase protein (hsCRP), PAI-1, fibrinogen, transferrin, albumin, MPO (myeloperoxidase), and cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, ICAM-1, MCP-1, leptin, and adiponectin, among other markers. For NAD+ content in plasma at fasting and postprandially, we will add 0.5 M ice-cold HClO4 to samples; after 2 min, we will collect 100 μL of supernatants by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 5 min, add 20 μL K2HPO4 (1 M) with cooling on ice and adjust pH to 7.2-7.4 with KOH. We will add 50 μL of supernatant to the reaction mixture containing 0.1 M sodiumpyrophosphate-semicarbazid (pH 8.8), absolute ethanol, and dH2O. We will assess NAD+ spectrophotometrically at 339 nm at 25 °C, as a mean difference in absorbance before and 6 min after addition of alcohol dehydrogenase.</description>
