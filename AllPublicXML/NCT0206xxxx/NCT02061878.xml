  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proof of mechanism pilot clinical trial is to determine if the
      RXR agonist bexarotene acts in humans to alter the CSF levels of apoE and alter the clearance
      of Amyloid-Beta

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, investigational drug study designed to measure the effect of
      bexarotene on the clearance of Aβ total and production of apoE in the human brain of young,
      healthy individuals with the APOE3/3 genotype. From the date of initial subject recruitment
      to the issuance of a final study report and closeout activities, the expected total study
      duration is 6 to 10 months.

      Each participant will be screened for eligibility and randomized to receive either oral
      bexarotene or placebo control (&quot;Test Article&quot;).The study has the potential to demonstrate the
      pharmacodynamic properties of a novel treatment approach to Alzheimer's disease. The primary
      biomarker measurements obtained from this study are believed to be highly dynamic and able to
      provide a rapid read-out of the biologic activity of the candidate therapeutic under study.
      In addition, exploratory analysis will involve a proteomics-based screen to identify proteins
      within both blood and CSF that are induced by the Test Article, thereby potentially
      identifying new biomarkers that can be used in future clinical trials to demonstrate
      bexarotene action and target engagement.
