  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is designed to test the global hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids
      (ICS), a therapy developed to treat asthma, will prevent vasoocclusive painful episodes in
      adults with SCD who wheeze, but do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma. The specific
      aims of this proposal are 1) Conduct a feasibility study - a randomized controlled trial of
      ICS for adults with SCD who do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma but report
      recurrent cough or wheezing, 2) Measure the effects of ICS on biological correlates of
      pulmonary inflammation (as determined by exhaled nitric oxide) and vascular injury (as
      determined by sVCAM) in SCD, and 3) Compare properties of traditional and Bayesian adaptive
      clinical trial design for therapeutic trials in SCD in preparation for designing a definitive
      trial of ICS. These aims have the potential to 1) change the standard of care for individuals
      with SCD and recurrent cough or wheeze, 2) provide insight into the pathogenesis of
      non-asthmatic wheezing in SCD and its response to treatment, 3) explore the suitability of
      innovative clinical trial designs to overcome the challenges that have hindered therapeutic
      innovation for SCD.
