      This study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled study that will be conducted in Ain
      Shams University Maternity Hospital.

      A total of 50 women scheduled to undergo myomectomy for symptomatic uterine myoma will be
      included in this study after taking their consent for this clinical trial after full
      explanation of the trial.

      The total of 50 included patients will be divided into two groups: Group A (Study group;):
      will Include 25 patients undergoing myomectomy operation will receive two tablets of
      misoprostol (400 mcg) rectally two hours before the operation.Group B (Control group): will
      Include 25 patients undergoing myomectomy operation will not receive misoprostol before the
      operation.
