  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of new interventional approaches
      in the early postoperative phase following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It is assumed that
      active training programs are more effective in improving physical function than the passive
      standard-of-care therapy.

      The major objectives of rehabilitation after TKA are the early regain of range of motion
      (ROM) and mobilization of the patient. Continuous passive motion (CPM) is frequently used as
      part of the postoperative care regime following TKA with the aim to increase knee joint
      mobility and improve postoperative recovery despite little conclusive scientific evidence.
      Conflicting research findings have generated an ongoing debate on its usage. As the greatest
      loss of function occurs in the first month following TKA, it is surprising that the ROM
      therapy during hospital stay is still carried out passively. A passive mobilization of the
      knee joint with CPM does not encourage the patients to actively participate in their
      rehabilitation. Research on the effectiveness of active ROM exercises added to standard
      physiotherapy during the short in-hospital period is lacking so far.The objective of this
      study is to compare the passive clinical standard therapy (CPM) with different active
      training programs (controlled active motion, CAM). It was hypothesised that the CAM therapies
      are more effective in improving physical function than the CPM therapy.
