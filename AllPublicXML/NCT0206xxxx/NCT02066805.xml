    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate off-label XGEVA use in Denmark using data linked from registries
      and other sources in Northern Jutland Region and Copenhagen. This will allow for accurate
      assessment of prescriptions and diagnoses, especially those related to cancer patients during
      the first year post the initial market availability of XGEVA.

        will be identified from the Danish National Registry of Patients and other sources in the
        Northern Jutland Region and Copenhagen.
