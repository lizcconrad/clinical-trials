  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is commonly treated using laterally wedged insoles. Although these
      insoles typically reduce knee abduction moments (KAM) - a variable associated with knee
      osteoarthritis - and thus are believed to be beneficial for OA management, recent research
      has indicated that in some cases lateral wedge insoles actually increase knee joint loads. In
      such cases, a medial wedge may be more appropriate.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of reduced KAMs on pain over 3-months
      for patients with knee OA. It is hypothesized that pain reduction will be directly related to
      KAM reduction.

      Forty-six participants with knee OA will be recruited to participate. Each will undergo
      biomechanical gait analysis to determine the wedge type that most greatly reduces knee
      adduction moments. In addition, each participant will undergo a Dual Energy X-Ray
      Absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify adiposity. Finally, participants will complete a series
      of questionnaires to evaluate pain, function, physical activity, footwear comfort and injury
      history. Participants will be randomized into either a wait list control group (no insole) or
      experimental group (medial or lateral wedged insole), and monitored for 3 months.

      Changes to pain, function, comfort and physical activity from baseline to 3 months will be
      assessed within the control and experimental groups. Regression analyses will be conducted on
      the experimental group to determine if a relationship exists between reduced KAMs and reduced
      pain over 3 months. Comparisons will also be made between the control and experimental
      groups.

    <description>Wedged insoles are designed to reduce frontal plane knee joint mechanical loads during gait. Specifically, they can alter the knee adduction moment during gait - a variable associated with progression of knee osteoarthritis. In the experimental arm of this study, participants will undergo biomechanical gait analysis to identify the wedged insole that reduces the moments the most. The two options are medial wedge, where the medial aspect of the foot is elevated relative to the lateral aspect, and the lateral wedge, where the lateral wedge is elevated relative to the medial aspect.</description>
