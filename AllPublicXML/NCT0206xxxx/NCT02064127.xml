      The investigators aim to evaluate in a retrospective study the performance of the Swiss
      Emergency Triage Scale to identify at the door of the Emergency Department patients requiring
      emergent intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients are triaged at the door of our Emergency Department using the Swiss Emergency
      Triage Scale. Patients with abdominal pain may be triaged in two different emergency levels
      (level 2: medical evaluation within 20 minutes, level 3: medical evaluation within 2 hours).
      These levels are determined using a set of specific criteria.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity of these specific criteria in order to
      identify promptly patients with abdominal pain the will require an emergent intervention
      during their stay in the Emergency Department.
