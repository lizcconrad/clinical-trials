      Prenatal yoga has become a popular means of exercise during pregnancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, yoga was reported to be practiced by approximately 20 million Americans, out of
      which 82% are women practitioners. The effects of yoga on the fetus have not been
      demonstrated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute fetal response to yoga
      exercises by assessing fetal well-being via ultrasound and non-stress testing among healthy
      women. The investigators hypothesize that yoga during pregnancy does not have any acute
      negative effects on fetal behavior as assessed by umbilical artery Dopplers and fetal heart
      rate or maternal vital signs.

    <time_frame>An umbilical artery ratio will be obtained on the day of intervention via an ultrasound machine. The first assessment will be before the intervention. The second assessment will be after a 1 hour intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of our study will be assessing umbilical artery S/D ratio (Dopplers). Doppler examination will be performed on the day of intervention. Approximately 20-30 minutes prior to the intervention and 20-30 minutes after a 1 hour intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Fetal heart rate will be obtained on the day of intervention via a non stress test. The first assessment will be before the intervention. The second assessment will be after a 1 hour intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome will be the fetal heart rate. To assess if there is a change from 20-30 minutes prior to an intervention, to 20 -30 minutes after a 1 hour intervention.</description>

    <description>A 1-hour yoga session will take place with guided instruction provided by a registered yoga instructor. The class includes a warm up period of 5 minutes, which includes sitting with the eyes closed and slowly breathing through the nose. After which the participant will perform a series of yoga postures in coordination with her breathing for approximately 45 minutes. The last 10 minutes of class will encompass a semi-recumbent relaxation period. This is a one time intervention.</description>
