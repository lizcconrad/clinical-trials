      The aims of this trials are:

        1. to collect published and unpublished individual classic pharmacokinetic data (individual
           patient data from independent investigators and pharmaceutical companies)

        2. to make available population pharmacokinetic models for the concentrates derived from
           the data collected

        3. to develop a web based application intended to use the above models to calculate
           pharmacokinetic parameters for individual patients, and

        4. to test the system functionality via simulation of the use of the prototype by use of
           faked test data.

      Study setting: All the development phases (a to c) will take place at McMaster University in
      Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Phase d) will involve the centers selected for the subsequent
      twinned protocol, but will not use real patient data. The IT system will sit on a web
      accessible platform developed and run by the Health Information Research Unit (HiRU) at
      McMaster University.

      Participants: There are no patients taking part in this development phase. Companies and
      independent investigators will act as co-investigators and will provide already existing
      on-file individual pharmacokinetic (PK) data. Faked test data will be used for step d).

      Eligibility criteria: There are no patients taking part in this development phase, thus
      eligibility criteria will be applied to pre-existing datasets. Primary investigators or
      companies who own original pharmacokinetic data of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates
      will provide data for the creation of the model. No restriction as to country, language or
      factor concentrate will be applied.

      Interventions: There is no therapeutic intervention planned as part of this study. The study
      will result in a system intended to be used to produce patient level estimates potentially
      useful to modify the treatment regimens of the patients. The phase 1 &quot;activities&quot; portion the
      WAPPS-Hemo project include the following:

        1. a systematic review to identify all the existing publications reporting pharmacokinetic
           data on factor VIII and IX. Only articles reporting individual classic pharmacokinetic
           data will be included. The data extracted will be extracted and compiled to be used to
           create the population pharmacokinetic models. Investigators and companies, fulfilling
           the eligibility criteria, will be invited to provide data and to sign a bilateral Data
           Transfer Agreement Data will be subsequently transferred to HIRU, stored in a secure
           database and coded as needed for step b).

        2. establishment of a population pharmacokinetic model by splitting the data into two sets:
           a modeling set, from which the pharmacokinetic model will be built, and a validation
           set, to be used to test the model before implementation. Initially, the population
           pharmacokinetic model will be built using only the modeling data and validated using the
           validation set through goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrapping, and visual prediction
           checks (VPC). After the model validation, the entire data set will be used to derive the
           final model for prospective use.

        3. integration of the population pharmacokinetic models into the WAPPS-HEMO web service.
           The Information Technology Support Group at HIRU will perform extensive in-house
           beta-testing using fabricated data.

        4. field testing of the website by asking centers participating in the research network to
           test the website with fabricated patient data. After successful registration, the
           centers will be provided with this data, and asked to generate records for those
           patients. We will then run Population PK estimates, pilot the reporting process, gather
           feedback on the testing process and troubleshoot any issues that come up. As well, we
           will gather focus group feed-back and modify the service accordingly.

      Outcomes: The WAPPS-Hemo project will result in:

        1. a repository of all published and unpublished dataset of concentration-time point for
           selected population of hemophilia patients studied after administration of factor
           concentrates. Published data will be summarized in a systematic review and submitted for
           publication.

        2. population pharmacokinetic models for the factor concentrates for which
           concentration-time point for population of hemophilia patients. The model development
           will be described in a scientific report. The extended version will be available as part
           of the study documentation, while a synthetic version will be submitted for publication.

        3. availability of the web application to be used in the phase d) of the study.

        4. availability of the prototypal web application to be used in the subsequent phase 2 of
           the WAPPS-Hemo protocol.

      Participant timeline: We will require 12 months to gather the data, build the model, and
      create the prototypal web service.

      Sample size: We expect to be able to derive models for concentrates for which we have 50 or
      more pre-existing individual PK data. We expect to have data available for 4 or more
      different factor concentrates.

      Recruitment: No patients will be recruited for this phase of the overall WAPPS program. Only
      already published data or data on file will be used to derive the model and set up the
      system. All the investigator of the studies identified via the literature search will be
      contacted and invited to provide data. All the drug manufactures active in the hemophilia
      field will be invited to provide on-file pharmacokinetic data.

      Data collection methods: Data will be collected from the primary investigators and companies
      that have agreed to provide original pharmacokinetic data on factor VIII and factor IX
      concentrates.

      Website development A cluster of fully resilient HP servers (Windows web servers in Network
      load balancing configuration for the hosting the site, Microsoft SQL for the database, and
      Windows server for the NONMEM software), located in two different buildings, will support the
      system platform. The system will also incorporate fully mirrored hard disks, and redundant
      Https connection. The administrative website and backup database will be accessible only over
      a virtual private network (VPN). The system will be available 24/7 with a downtime of &lt; 0.01
      of total up time. All WAPPS related url (.com, .org, .ca, etc have been blocked immediately
      at project funding notification - August 2013). All the needed licenses will be acquired,
      including a single site license for the Icon NONMEM population PK software. The website,
      database access interface, back-end NONMEM interface will be programmed in dot.net.

      The system will be built ready to transfer information in a format compatible with the
      hypertext languages used to embed knowledge into Electronic Medical Records (e.g., Arden
      syntax and SEBASTIAN framework, http://www.openclinical.org/gmmsummaries.html), to facilitate
      potential interface with the electronic medical record, database, and clinical trial case
      report form at a later stage.

      Data management: Data from the primary investigators and companies will be stored on a secure
      McMaster University server and only the research team will be able to access it. As the data
      provided to the research team will already be anonymized, there will be no need for further
      anonymization. Notwithstanding in this phase of the study, only already existing data from
      previous publications and on-file company-owned database will be used. We are providing a
      description of the data management for the subsequent phase of the study (WAPPS phase 2,
      protocol: The Implementation, User Testing and Validation of the Web-based Application for
      the Population Pharmacokinetic Service - Hemophilia (WAPPS-HEMO)). Users will be allowed to
      access and use the system only after a moderated registration process. The head of the
      partner research center will need to go through a registration process, and after validation
      by the McMaster team, she/he will receive credentials to access the website. She/he will
      subsequently be able to authorize other users from her/his center to access the system. Each
      individual user will have unique access credentials, and will be authorized to manage
      patients from the center she/he belong to. Only authorized users will be able to create and
      access patient record, and/or input the information required for the PK assessment. The
      identification of patients will happen via a combination of three different keys, a minimum
      of two of which should be provided in case of subsequent access to the record. The three
      identifiers will be:

        1. the WAPPS unique identifier, generated by the system at patient's record creation, and
           reported on each page and printout relative to that patient,

        2. the patient birthdate, in the format &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, or

        3. a local patient identifier. As to c, wherever allowed by the local center privacy
           regulation, we will recommend to use a string composed by
           &quot;LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME,LOCAL_CENTER_ID&quot;. For centers whose relevant regulation does not
           allow the use of this information, any combination of alphanumeric codes will be
           accepted. It will then be the responsibility of the local center to track the local
           identifier in the patient file.

      The data above will be provided by the user creating a record for the patient on the system.
      For subsequent re-access of any user from the same center to any specific patient record from
      the center, the system will display a list of the registered patient, using the identifier
      provided (i.e. a) and b) mandatorily, c) with the information provided by the center. The
      user will be then able to access a specific patient record for the allowed operation (as
      described in the study protocol for step 2).

      Statistical methods: The NONMEM 7 version 1.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD)
      will be used with an Intel Fortran compiler (version 12) for population pharmacokinetic
      modeling. The statistical program R (version 2.15.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
      Vienna, Austria) will be used to compile the NONMEM sets and generate the graphical
      representations of the models. Perl Speaks NONMEM (PsN, version 3.5.3) and PsN and Xpose 4
      will be used, respectively, for the bootstrapping and the VPC validation tests.

      In order to estimate the population pharmacokinetic parameters, we will use a first-order
      conditional estimation with interaction method (FOCEI). Exponential function will be used to
      model inter-individual variability (IIV), and the inclusion of IIV terms on pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be tested in sequential order. IIV addition with the most significant
      objective function value (OFV) reduction will enter the model first. Inter-assessment
      variability (IAV) will also be evaluated with baseline pharmacokinetics at first available
      assessment as assessment 1 and repeat pharmacokinetic profiling at the subsequent available
      time as assessment 2. Any residual errors found in the data will be modeled as combined
      additive and proportional errors.

      Potential demographic or clinical factors potentially affecting the pharmacokinetics
      (including the type of concentrates for the basic overarching model to be used for products
      for which product-specific data will not be available and the characteristics of the
      laboratory technique used to measure the plasma factor level concentration) will be screened
      using plots of IIV versus the covariates. When the covariates are continuous, scatter plots
      of ETA (IIV code used in NONMEM) versus the covariates will be used to determine functional
      relationships. These scatter plots will be overlaid with a non-parametric locally weighted
      smoother LOESS line. When the covariates are categorical, potential differences between
      groups will be identified using box and whisker plots. Any possible influence by continuous
      covariates should be suggested by a clear trend of positive or negative slopes and
      outstanding correlation coefficients. Influence from categorical covariates will be suggested
      by pronounced changes between the mean values of each group. In the covariate modeling, a
      full stepwise forward addition (P&lt;0.005) and backward elimination (P&lt;0.001) procedure will be
      used.

      The model selection will also be validated with goodness-of-fit plots, including observation
      (OV) versus population prediction (PRED), OV versus individual prediction (IPRED),
      conditional weighted residual (CWRES) versus TIME and PRED plots. Other diagnostics, such as
      parameter precision, ETA, and CWRES distribution and shrinkage, will also be used to choose
      the proper population pharmacokinetic model.

      Methods: Monitoring

      Data monitoring: For step I of the WAPPS protocol, there is no need to plan a data monitoring
      process. Indeed, all data will be validated as part of model derivation, and used as such in
      the rest of the study. Congruency checks will be performed on user's input data and PK
      estimations in the subsequent phase 2 of the study and subsequently in routine use of the
      interface.

      Harms: During the development phases (a to c), we will not offer the web application beyond
      the boundaries of the developing research unit. The website will be made available to the
      centers in the research network during the testing phase d) (using only fabricated data) and
      the subsequent phase 2 of the protocol. We will clearly identify the prototypal and
      experimental use of the system in both the Research Agreements and the website page as a
      &quot;Research tool not yet ready for clinical practice&quot;. A clear disclaimer will indicate that
      &quot;Any use of the results of the population pharmacokinetic estimates in the care of individual
      patients should not be considered part of the project in this phase&quot;.

    <description>The performance of the model(s) will be assessed with statistical indexes of goodness of fit, and by simulation exercises where partial data from individual PK estimates will be used to predict concentration at different time points, subsequently comparing observed and expected values, then compared by chi-square statistics. Similarly, the equivalence of estimates produced on a reduced set of points will be compared with those produced from the analysis of the full data set. Since any PK analysis is by definition providing estimates of the true unknown value, and it is as well know a priori that the population PK estimation will produce estimates with higher uncertainty, only partly dependent on the sample size, the usual approach is not to predefine a cut off to accept or refuse the model, but more so to describe its statistical properties.</description>
