    <textblock>
      The following trial hypothesis will be proved: In patients with atrial fibrillation and/ or
      pulmonary embolism standard anticoagulant treatment with coumadin/phenprocoumon is associated
      with accelerated coronary or valvular calcification as assessed by cardiac computed
      tomography compared to the new anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi center, prospective, controlled, open, randomized, interventional clinical trial
      blinded concerning outcome measurements with a two- arm parallel group design will be
      performed to investigate the association of rivaroxaban compared to coumadin/phenprocoumon
      treatment for OAT in patients with atrial fibrillation and / or pulmonary embolism regarding
      the development and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and aortic valve
      calcification (AVC) as assessed by multi-slice spiral computed tomography scanning (MSCT)
      within one year follow-up.

      In total 190 patients (95 patients per treatment arm) with atrial fibrillation and/ or
      pulmonary embolism with the indication for oral anticoagulation therapy will be enrolled.

      After screening first cardiac CT scan will be performed in order to validate if calcium score
      is &gt;50 which is an inclusion criteria. If the patient matches all other inclusion/exclusion
      criteria the remaining imaging procedures (Echocardiography, Intima Media Thickness of
      carotid artery (IMT) and Flow Mediated Vasodilatation (FMD), Electrocardiography (ECG) and
      blood pressure are executed. Pregnancy strip test will be executed and also serum chemistry,
      hematology, coagulation and batch analysis will be performed.

      Patients will then be randomized to one of the two arms (Rivaroxaban or Marcumar) and will
      undergo the same examinations and measurements as described above at 1 week, 1, 6, 9 and 12
      month Follow- Up (FU). In case of a positive result in respect to the primary endpoint a FU
      after 2 years will be performed optionally.
