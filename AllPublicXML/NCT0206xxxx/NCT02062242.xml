  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of transvaginal electrical
      stimulation, vaginal palpation, and vaginal palpation associated with posterior pelvic tilt
      and contraction of accessory muscles in the acquisition of ability to contract the pelvic
      floor muscles (PFM), as well as to evaluate the sexual function of women studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many women does not know to contract the PFM voluntarily favoring the development of
      disorders such as urinary and fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and sexual disorders.
      However there are no studies in the literature that address the application of therapeutic
      resources available to improve the PFM awareness. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of transvaginal electrical stimulation, vaginal palpation, vaginal
      palpation associated with posterior pelvic tilt and contraction of accessory muscles in the
      acquisition of ability to contract the PFM, as well as to evaluate the sexual function of
      women studied. One hundred twenty women with PFM function graded 0 and 1 measured by Oxford
      Modified Scale will be submitted at random to physical therapy with transvaginal electrical
      stimulation, vaginal palpation, vaginal palpation associated with posterior pelvic tilt and
      contraction of accessory muscles (glutes and hip adductors) and the control group who receive
      verbal instructions related to the pelvic floor and its contraction. For the evaluation of
      the sexual function will be applied the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).

      The patients will be assessed by vaginal palpation, perineometry and surface electromyography
      before and after the intervention.

    <description>The transvaginal electrical stimulation, vaginal palpation, and vaginal palpation associated with posterior pelvic tilt and contraction of accessory muscles improve the results in the acquisition of contraction capacity of PFM when compared to controls that receive verbal instructions related to the PFM. The improvement will be assessed through the increase of the grade of vaginal palpation measured by Oxford Modified Scale and through the increase of values of the perineometry and surface eletromyography.</description>
