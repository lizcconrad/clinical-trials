  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare healing time, scar size, aesthetic outcome, and complication rates following
      second intention healing or purse string closure of surgical wounds on the trunk or
      extremities. This study, will allow surgeons to make informed decisions on whether purse
      string closure is superior to that of second intention healing and thus worth considering or
      inferior and not worth performing.

    <description>After surgical procedure, subjects will be randomized into one of two wound healing groups: by second intention (no sutures) or by purse-string closure (with sutures). After 3 months, subjects will return to clinic for evaluation of the pain scale and cosmesis of both types of healing techniques.</description>

    <description>The wound will be closed using one, long, continuous suture which will enter and exit run through the skin along the inner edge of the wound. The start and stopping point will be adjacent to one another. The suture will then be pulled&quot; on either side to essentially cinch down the wound, decreasing the size of the wound.</description>
