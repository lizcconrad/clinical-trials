      Objective To observe the effect of early goal directed therapy (EGDT) on hepatic perfusion in
      patients with septic shock.

      Methods A prospective observational study was carried out. The eligible patients were treated
      with the standard procedure of EGDT. The hemodynamic data were recorded. Oxygen metabolism
      and hepatic function were monitored. Indocyanine clearance test was applied to detect the
      hepatic perfusion. Hemodynamics, hepatic perfusion, oxygen metabolism and hepatic function
      were compared before treatment, after EGDT and 24 hours after EGDT.
