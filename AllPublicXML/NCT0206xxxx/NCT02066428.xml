      Phase I, randomized, double blinded, Placebo-controlled, immunogenicity and dose-range

      females.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This ia a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in three groups of
      healthy adult males or sterile females who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no
      evidence of tuberculosis infection.

      Sixty-four subjects assigned to one of eight treatment groups to receive one of four
      different antigen/adjuvant combinations of study vaccine, or placebo control. Within each
      study group, subjects will be randomized to receive either a single-dose antigen/adjuvant
      regimen of study vaccine (vaccination with study vaccine on Study Day 0 followed by
      vaccination with placebo control on Study Day 56) or a two-dose antigen/adjuvant regimen of
      study vaccine (vaccination with study vaccine on Study Days 0 and 56).

      All subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days.

      The sample sizes specified for each study group were selected because they are judged to be
      adequate for preliminary safety and immunogenicity evaluations for a Phase I study rather
      than for statistical reasons. If no SAE are observed among 56 subjects receiving active study
      vaccine, an approximation to the upper 95% confidence bound on the rate of SAE occurrence
      would be 5.4%.

    <measure>Evaluate the safety of one or two injections of two AERAS 404 antigen amounts administered with three different amounts of adjuvant</measure>
    <time_frame>All subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. A total of eleven clinic visits are planned (excluding screening) for all subjects</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAE) will be collected on subjects throughout their participation in the study. Solicited and unsolicited AEs will be collected through 28 days after each vaccination.The safety profile of the different antigen/adjuvant treatment regimens will be described. Listings will be provided for all subjects with serious adverse events (SAE). All adverse events and clinically relevant laboratory results will be summarized across time points to examine the relationship between treatment regimens (i.e., number of doses and level of antigen/adjuvant) and key safety endpoints including number (percentage) of solicited and spontaneous adverse events and number (percentage) of subjects with newly abnormal post-vaccination laboratory values based on predefined toxicity criteria. Adverse events will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study vaccine by treatment regimen.</description>

    <time_frame>all subjects will have immunology samples taken at 9 time points over 182 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of immune response will be based on the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T cells producing any of three cytokines (interferon gamma, IFN-γ; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-α; and/or interleukin-2, IL-2) or any combination of these three cytokines simultaneously in response to stimulation with two the antigenic peptide pools contains 85B and TB10.4 representing the entire amino acid sequences of mycobacterial antigens Ag85B and TB10.4, respectively. Responses will be measured by flow cytometry using a qualified intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay</description>
