  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IVRA can be performed with many local anesthetics and adjuvant agents. In our study we
      planned to compare cardiac effects and ECG changes by IVRA with lidocaine and lidocaine plus
      ketamine.

      Methods: In our study patients between 18-60 years, with score of ASA 1-2 and who were
      undergoing IVRA for short operations on arm and forearm were included. Systolic, diastolic
      and mean blood pressures, heart rate, Spo2, ECG, adverse effects during the operation were
      recorded. Double cuffed tourniquet were placed on the extremity to be operated to hinder
      nerve injuries. With Esmarch bandage venous blood in the extremity was purged. Proximal cuff
      was inflated with a pressure 50-100 mmHg higher than systolic blood pressure and the bandage
      was displaced. Randomly patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1: %0.5 Lidocaine+Ketamine
      0.8 mg/kg; 40 ml. Group 2: %0.5 Lidocaine 40 ml. Anesthetic agent was injected with a rate of
      20 ml/min. 20 minutes after injection the distal cuff was inflated and the proximal cuff
      deflated with a rate of 50 mmHg in every 3 minutes. 0,5,10,15,30,45,60 minutes after the
      beginning of deflation and 10 minutes after the deflation was completed ECG were recorded.
      PR,QT,QTc, RR were recorded.
