  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week progressive resistance
      training (PRT) during concurrent chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients compared
      to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12 patients with head and neck cancer will be recruited to this trial. Entering a 12-week PRT
      program which will start one week before radiotherapy. The tested training program is a
      12-week, supervised, group based, progressive resistance training program involving the major
      muscle groups of the body. The program has previously been found to successfully restore the
      loss of lean body mass (LBM) in head and neck cancer patients post-treatment. A group based
      approach will be used to facilitate a social and motivating training environment for the
      patients. This approach has previously been used for exercise interventions for lung cancer
      patients at our facility, and was highly appreciated by the patients.

      In addition to baseline data (height, tumor stage, performance status, etc), the following
      parameters will be registered on a weekly basis: Weight, patient reported side effects, as
      well as a questionnaire on amount of physical activity and food intake.

      Physical function and strength will be tested at baseline, after the course of
      chemoradiotherapy and at the end of the 12-week PRT programme, and at 2, 5, 9 and 13 months
      follow-up. At similar time points dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans for body
      composition will be performed using a Lunar iDXA (GE Healthcare).

      Blood samples will be drawn at baseline, an additional three times during the first 6 weeks
      and then weekly in relation to training sessions, and at 2, 5, 9 and 13 months follow-up.

      Patient reported quality of life (EORTC Quality of Life Questionaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-H&amp;N35)
      will be registered at baseline, after 12-weeks PRT and during 5 and 13 months follow-up.

      Study duration is expected to be 7 months for the pilot-trial, with a follow-up of additional
      13 months after the last patient has completed the intervention.
