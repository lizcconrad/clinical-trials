  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of (classification determinant)
      CD34+ stem cell selection on graft versus host disease (GVHD) in children, adolescents, and
      young adults. CD34+ stem cells are the cells that make all the types of blood cells in the
      body. GVHD is a condition that results from a reaction of transplanted donor T-lymphocytes (a
      kind of white blood cell) against the recipient's body and organs. Study subjects will be
      offered treatment involving the use of the CliniMACS® Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotec), a
      CD34+ selection device to remove T-cells from a peripheral blood stem cell transplant in
      order to decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD.

      This study involves subjects who are diagnosed with a malignant disease, that has either
      failed standard therapy or is unlikely to be cured with standard non-transplant therapy, who
      will receive a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. A malignant disease includes the
      following: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, accelerated phase or blast
      crisis; Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML); Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS); Juvenile
      Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML); Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); or Lymphoma (Hodgkin's
      and Non-Hodgkin's).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the serious complications following allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation. The incidence and severity of GVHD increase with the degree of HLA
      incompatibility between the host and donor. The most reliable way to prevent acute and
      chronic GVHD is to remove T cells from the graft. However, the incidence of graft failure
      increases with the efficiency of T cell depletion and low T cell numbers are predictive of
      graft failure. Immunomagnetic selection of HLA-mismatched CD34+ progenitor cells has
      demonstrated high levels of T cell depletion and successful engraftment in adult and
      pediatric patients with the malignant and nonmalignant disease.
