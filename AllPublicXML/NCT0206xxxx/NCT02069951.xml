  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical training programs using virtual reality simulators often only use basic skills
      training and the use of procedural training is very limited. Procedural training differs from
      basic skills training by requiring integration of isolated skills and decision making and
      planning components. However, it is unknown if it is necessary to practice all procedures
      before operating on actual patients or whether it is simply a matter of learning psychomotor
      skills and if these skills are transferable between different tasks.

      The main hypothesis is that practicing a laparoscopic procedure on a simulator makes it
      easier to reach proficiency on a different laparoscopic procedure on the simulator because
      participants have already practiced the integration of isolated skills.

    <description>All participants start by practicing a series of six basic skills modules until they reach a predefined proficiency level for each module. For all of the basic skills exercises proficiency is reached when the participants have passed the proficiency level for all exercises.
Participants randomised to the intervention group will practice two procedures on a simulator. First a procedural module A (a laparoscopic appendectomy) to a predefined proficiency level. Upon reaching proficiency for procedural module A the participants will practice procedural module B (a laparoscopic salpingectomy) to a predefined proficiency level.</description>

    <description>All participants start by practicing a series of six basic skills modules until they reach a predefined proficiency level for each module. For all of the basic skills exercises proficiency is reached when the participants have passed the proficiency level for all exercises. Each exercise has to be passed twice within five consecutive attempts.
Participants randomised to the control group will practice procedural module B (a laparoscopic salpingectomy) to a predefined proficiency level.</description>
