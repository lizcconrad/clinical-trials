      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the overall response rate (including complete response and partial response) of
      subjects treated with combination therapy docetaxel and cisplatin followed by the
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of combination therapy docetaxel and cisplatin followed
      by the chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment duration for each patient will be around six months. Patients included in the
      study will be treated with induction regimen followed by chemo radiotherapy. Within the
      induction period there are three cycles (Docetaxel + Cisplatin) every 21 days, with follow-up
      post-induction at day 21 after cycle three. This is followed by chemoradiotherapy consisting
      of radiotherapy for six weeks and cisplatin every week for four weeks. The post-consolidation
      follow up is at eight weeks after end of chemoradiotherapy.

    <description>Induction:One-hour intravenous infusion of docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 followed by a 30 minute intravenous infusion of cisplatin at 75 mg/m2. All patients to be pre-medicated with oral dexamethasone at 8 mg twice daily for 3 days, commencing one day before docetaxel infusion. All patients will be premedicated with intravenous dexamethasone 20 mg to be administered before cisplatin infusion. Docetaxel and cisplatin treatments to be repeated every 21 days for three cycles.
Chemoradiotherapy (CRT): Cisplatin to be administered by 30 minutes intravenous infusion at a dose of 30 mg/m2 weekly starting concomitantly with conventional radiotherapy for a period of 6 weeks. Intravenous cisplatin to be continued for four weeks.
Radiotherapy: Gross disease dose will be 60 Gy/30 fractions and sub clinical dose 45-50 Gy/30 fractions.</description>
