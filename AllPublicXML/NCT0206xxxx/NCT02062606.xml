  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the restoration and maintenance of thoracic kyphosis and coronal curve correction
      demonstrated through the surgical implantation of the K2M MESA Rail™ Deformity System as
      compared to literature reported outcomes for standard Cobalt Chrome (CoCr) rod systems in the
      treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with the Ø5.5mm or Ø4.5mm MESA Rail™ Deformity System that had:

      Diagnosis of AIS requiring surgical treatment for selective non-cervical fusion with a
      minimum of five (5) instrumented vertebrae between T1-S1 as confirmed by patient history and
      radiographic studies.

      AIS cases must be classified as a Lenke type 1 or type 2 curve (lumbar modifiers and thoracic
      sagittal profiles will be noted but not restrictive).

      Age at time of surgery of ≥ 11 years old and ≤ 21 years old.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of AIS requiring surgical treatment for selective thoracic/lumbar fusion
             with a minimum of five (5) instrumented vertebrae between T1-S1 as confirmed by
             patient history and radiographic studies. AIS cases must be classified as a Lenke type
             1 or type 2 curve. No cervical vertebrae are to be incorporated into the construct.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with the requirements of the protocol including
             follow-up requirements.

          -  Willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent form or, in the case of a
             patient who is a minor, provide assent and the minor patient's parent/legal guardian
             provides written consent to participate.

          -  Age range of ≥ 11 years old and ≤ 21 years old at time of surgery.

          -  Previous anterior or posterior spine surgery at the index levels.

          -  Previous posterior spine surgery (e.g., posterior element decompression) that
             destabilizes the cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine.

          -  Active systemic infection or infection at the operative site.

          -  Co-morbid medical conditions of the spine or upper/lower extremities that may affect
             the thoracic or lumbar spine neurological and/or pain assessment.

          -  Metabolic bone disease such as osteoporosis that contradicts spinal surgery.

          -  History of an osteoporotic fracture.

          -  History of an endocrine or metabolic disorder (e.g., Paget's disease) known to affect
             bone and mineral metabolism.

          -  Taking medications that may interfere with bony/soft tissue healing including chronic
             steroid use.

          -  Known allergy to titanium or cobalt chrome.

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease or a systemic disorder such as HIV,
             active hepatitis B or C or fibromyalgia.

          -  Insulin-dependent type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

          -  Medical condition (e.g., unstable cardiac disease, cancer) that may result in patient
             death or have an effect on outcomes prior to study completion.

          -  Pregnant, or intend to become pregnant, during the course of the study.

          -  Severe obesity (Body Mass Index &gt; 40).
