      The Initiate and Maintain Physical Activity in Clinics (IMPACT) study will determine the
      optimal and feasible level of frequency of structured contact needed in a clinical setting
      for adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus to initiate and maintain physical activity
      recommendations long-term.

      The IMPACT Study will compare the health outcomes and lifestyle habits amongst the three
      groups of study participants. Study participants will be randomized into three exercise
      group. Group 1 will participate in instructor-led exercise training sessions 1 time per week,
      for 24 weeks (approximately 6 months). Group 2 will participate in instructor-led exercise
      training sessions 3 times per week, for 24 weeks (approximately 6 months). Group 3 will not
      attend any instructor-led exercise training sessions. All groups will be encouraged to see
      their usual providers for routine healthcare, and continue their usual medication regimen.

    <description>The study intervention is a 6-month exercise program with structured group sessions conducted in a clinical setting. Group sessions include Aerobic Training and Combined Training. Once-Weekly participants will attend one Combined Training session while thrice-weekly participants will attend two Combined Training sessions and one Aerobic Training session per week. Participants in both groups will attend three exercise evaluations during the intervention period. Participants will also use provided logs to track their daily exercise activities outside of group sessions. Physical activity will be assessed by group session attendance, exercise resistance and intensity, and exercise frequency data collected from exercise logs, surveys, and evaluations.</description>
