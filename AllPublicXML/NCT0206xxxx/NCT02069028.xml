    <textblock>
      The implementation of the sepsis resuscitation bundle recommended by the SSC guidelines has
      been shown to increase compliance and reduce mortality in several settings. Different
      implementation strategies have been utilized, including education, posters, reminders, audit
      and feedback, paper-based and electronic sepsis screening tools, clinical pathway and sepsis
      response teams. Different studies showed a considerable variation effect on compliance and
      mortality.It has been suggested that implantation strategies vary in there effect from low
      impact for human-based interventions such as education and training, rules and policies,
      reminders, checklists and double checks, however, reaching high effect for system based
      interventions like automation and computerization and forcing function. However, this has not
      been studied in relation to the implementation of SSC bundle. As such, many projects continue
      to invest on low-impact interventions with modest change in compliance and mortality.
      Multiple interventions were adopted by different centers worldwide to implement SSC
      guidelines. These interventions vary on their level of compliance and outcomes. The
      effectiveness of intervention if system oriented is more effective than human oriented. The
      hierarchy of effectiveness assigning forcing function intervention on the top of the pyramid
      and the training and education on the bottom.

      The investigators hypothesize that interventions system based interventions are more likely
      to be more effective in improving the compliance with sepsis resuscitation bundle and in
      improving mortality.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of different interventions for
      implementation of Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines and their impact on compliance and
      mortality reduction.
