  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the United States, and is on the rise in many
      industrialized nations. The rate of recidivism for long-term weight loss is substantial and
      presents a critical problem given the importance of obesity as a modifiable risk factor for
      diseases like type 2 diabetes. Further, the comorbidity of depression with diseases like
      obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease suggest that there may be an underlying
      shared biology for diseases of metabolic dysfunction and emotional dysregulation. The shared
      biology of these diseases may actually promote the precipitation and exacerbation of comorbid
      conditions, impacting the success of treatment. Endogenous opioid systems regulate a number
      of physiological and psychological processes including mood, energy management, and reward.
      Endogenous opioid µ-receptor-mediated reward processing is thought to be involved both in the
      short-term control of eating and hedonic food consumption, based on data in animal models.
      The present proposal will examine the function of the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) system in lean
      and obese human volunteers following an overnight fast and the change in µ-opioid receptor
      occupancy (i.e., endogenous opioid release) following the consumption of a standardized meal
      using PET imaging with the µ-selective radiotracer [11C]carfentanil. The obese individuals
      will be retested in the fasting and fed state following a 15% weight loss with a Very Low
      Calorie Diet. Further, the investigators will evaluate the function of the MOR system within
      the context of the individual's metabolic and psychological profile including aspects of mood
      and inhibitory control. This information will provide the neurobiological bases to develop
      novel avenues of intervention based on individual variations in central mechanisms associated
      with motivational systems and appetite and their potential role in weight regain.

      The investigators hypothesize that overeating in chronically obese individuals will be
      associated with a dysregulation of MOR system function, manifested by reductions in baseline
      MOR availability (binding potential, BP) in limbic and reward circuitry, and lower release of
      endogenous opioids after a standard meal, compared to lean volunteers. The latter is observed
      as acute reductions in the BP measure after meal ingestion.

      Neuroimaging Study. Male and Female volunteers will be recruited from the Investigational
      Weight Management Clinic (IWMC) at the University of Michigan for this study. All
      neuropsychological instruments will be collected in lean and obese individuals at baseline,
      and between 4-6-months. Obese individuals will undergo 4 PET scans: 1) at baseline following
      an overnight fast; 2) at baseline following consumption of an Ensure shake; 3) after at least
      a15% reduction in body weight following an overnight fast; 4) and following consumption of an
      Ensure shake at the post-weight loss time point. Lean individuals will undergo the two scans
      at baseline after fasting and post-Ensure shake consumption. All lean subjects will consume
      their normal diets prior to the initial scanning. The obese subjects will undergo their
      second set of scans, post-weight loss, while still consuming the HMR diet.

      Neuroimaging Measures. Two PET studies with [11C]carfentanil (a selective µ-opioid receptor
      radiotracer) will be acquired for each lean volunteer and 4 PET studies with [11C]carfentanil
      will be acquired for obese individuals. Structural and functional MRI will be acquired for
      obese individuals before and after weight loss, and for lean individuals at baseline for
      co-registration and anatomical standardization of the PET data and activation response to
      visual stimuli. After their completion, the following data will be used for statistical
      analyses: 1) Baseline µ-opioid receptor availability in vivo (binding potential, BPND) in
      lean and obese individuals following an overnight fast. 2) µ-opioid system activation after
      consuming 500 kcal (16fl oz, 18% protein, 14% CHO, 25% fat) of Ensure shake (fed) in lean and
      obese individuals as measured by acute reductions in BPND. 3) Baseline MOR BPND in obese
      individuals who have lost ≥15% of their body weight over 4-6 months (fasting), following an
      overnight fast. 4) µ-opioid system activation in obese individuals who have lost ≥15% of
      their body weight after consuming 250 kcal of Ensure shake (fed).

      PET Acquisition. Briefly, [11C]carfentanil a selective and specific µ-opioid receptor
      radioligand, is administered at tracer doses using a bolus/continuous infusion protocol to
      achieve rapid steady-states between specific and non-specific binding regions (5-7 min
      post-tracer administration). Twenty-eight frames will be acquired over 70 minutes with an
      increasing duration (30 sec to 5 min). Two scans will be acquired twice each: A baseline,
      without challenges, and a scan following consumption of an Ensure shake. Subsequently,
      dynamic image data for the receptor scans is transformed, on a voxel-by-voxel basis, into
      parametric maps, and co-registered to each other. These include, 1) a tracer transport
      measure (K1 ratio, proportional to cerebral blood flow; tracer transport = blood flow x
      tracer extraction), and receptor-related measures, (BPND), during 2) baseline scans, and 3)
      following shake consumption. The reduction in BPND from baseline to post-shake consumption
      represents a measure of endogenous opioid system activation following shake consumption
      (related to the occupancy and ligand-receptor interactions by the endogenous ligand). These
      parametric images are calculated using a modified Logan graphical analysis, with the
      occipital cortex as the reference region. PET images are then co-registered to the T1 MRI
      structural, anatomical image, affine transformed and warped to standard Montreal Neurological
      Institute (MNI) stereotactic space using mutual information algorithms. The baseline scan, in
      the fasted state, will precede the post-consumption scan due to time constraints, and to
      avoid carry-over effects from active (fed) to baseline (fasted) states. Both PET scans will
      be performed on the same day to reduce travel time for the subjects and hence experimental
      burden.

      Clinical Measures Psychobehavioral measures to be acquired during the imaging studies
      include: The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Profile of Mood Scales, State portion of the
      Spielberg Anxiety Inventory, and a visual analog scale (VAS) for appetite and palatability
      will be administered before and after each experiment. These measures will assess emotional
      state and appetite for correlative purposes with changes in neuroreceptor and circulating
      hormone levels during performance of the studies. The MINI International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview (MINI600), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR), EuroQol measure of
      health outcome, Trait portion of the Anxiety Inventory, and NEO Personality Inventory will be
      obtained prior to scanning for secondary analyses (e.g. relationship between imaging measures
      and &quot;stable&quot; traits).
