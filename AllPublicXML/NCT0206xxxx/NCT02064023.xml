  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating whether insulin treatment with the insulin pump or with multiple
      daily injections (MDI) gives better outcomes for mother and baby in pregnant women with
      pregestational diabetes. Participants will be randomized to use either the insulin pump or
      MDI.

      Primary outcome is a composite of Cesarian section, instrumental delivery, maternal
      hypertension, LGA infant, neonatal hypoglycemia or SCN admission.
