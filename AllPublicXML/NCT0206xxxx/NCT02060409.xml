    <textblock>
      In the era of hypomethylating agent in MDS treatment, the investigators aimed to investigate
      the prognostic impact of mutations in spliceosome machinery genes (SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2)
      on the outcomes of 1st line decitabine treatment in MDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have tried to investigate clinical impact of mutations in spliceosomal
      machinery genes in MDS but they failed to demonstrate a consistent prognostic relevance.
      Moreover, the clinical impact of these mutations on the outcomes of hypomethylating agent
      treatment in MDS has never been explored yet. The investigators investigated the prognostic
      impact of mutations in spliceosome machinery genes (SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) on the outcomes
      of 1st line decitabine treatment in MDS.
