  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of plasma 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol
      (1,5-AG) as a novel surrogate marker of hypoglycemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We enrolled well controlled diabetes patients who had hypoglycemic event at least one time
      more. All patients assess the risk of severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness using
      hypoglycemic awareness questionnaires (HYPO score). The patients who are treated with insulin
      agent were inserted sensor of continuous glucose monitoring systems under the skin during
      three days. We were analysed the correlation between 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol and HYPO score.
