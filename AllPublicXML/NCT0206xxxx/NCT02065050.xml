  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to evaluate whether a comprehensive discharge planning and
      close follow up for one year can improve clinical outcomes and cut costs of care for patients
      with poorly controlled diabetes. The study takes a high risk approach and is focused on
      patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery with HbA1c &gt;8%. Secondary goals include
      improving teamwork and communication for clinicians within the team and teaching nurse
      practitioners and physicians-in-training how to work effectively within interdisciplinary
      teams. Investigators anticipate that the results of this project may lead to the following
      benefits: 1) improved health outcomes for surgical patients with diabetes, 2) improved
      strategies for better communication within interdisciplinary health care teams, and 3)
      decreased health care costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who are planned for elective surgery at the hospital are seen in the
      pre-operative center a few days before admission. The diabetes management team becomes
      involved in care of patients with HbA1c &gt;8.0% at this time. Once the patients are admitted to
      the hospital, the diabetes management team continues to follow them until they are ready for
      discharge. At the point of discharge, patients are randomized to one of two arms- the usual
      care group and the expanded diabetes management service (eDMS). The eDMS group is followed
      closely for 1 year after discharge by the investigators to make sure they receive appropriate
      care for their diabetes.

      Aims of this study are:

        1. To evaluate whether patients that receive the eDMS have lower re-hospitalization rates
           at 1 month compared to patients who receive the traditional (current) DMS. Investigators
           hypothesize that the eDMS program will have lower re-hospitalization rates at 1 month.

        2. To evaluate whether patients that receive the eDMS have lower HbA1c levels at 1 year
           compared with patients who receive the traditional DMS. Investigators hypothesize that
           patients in the eDMS program will have lower HbA1c levels and improved diabetes-related
           health outcomes after 1 year in the program.
