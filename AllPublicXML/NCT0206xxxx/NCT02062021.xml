  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases are diseases in which inappropriate immune responses that have the
      capability of harming host cells play an important role. Evidence suggests that the presence
      of certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systematic lupus erythematosus
      increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this evidence is inconsistent for
      autoimmune disorders and no systematic approach has been previously used to study the
      relationship between a range of common autoimmune disorders and specific forms of
      cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, intracerebral and subarachnoid
      haemorrhage, or venous thrombosis.

      The investigators will use linked electronic health records to investigate whether commonly
      diagnosed autoimmune disorders are associated with increased risk of CVD development and
      whether effects differ in men and women and change with age.

      The linkage of Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to the national registry of acute
      coronary syndromes (the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project, MINAP), Hospital Episode
      Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) available through CALIBER
      (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic records), offers
      an opportunity to investigate the association between autoimmune disorders and the initial
      presentation of non-fatal and fatal specific cardiovascular phenotypes. The use of a
      systematic approach to investigate whether a range of commonly diagnosed autoimmune disorders
      are independent risk factors for several specific and well defined arterial and venous
      diseases will help to improve the investigators understanding of the role of autoimmune
      disorders in development of specific types of CVD in both men and women and in different age
      groups. It will also provide useful information to improve existing cardiovascular risk
      prediction methods that are used in clinical practice for patient management.
