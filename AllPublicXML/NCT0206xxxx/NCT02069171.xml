      Medical records will reviewed. And all patients who met the inclusion criteria will contacted
      by a telephone call by a clinical research coordinator. The telephone interview questionnaire
      for Lower Extremity Edema (LEE) and gynecologic cancer lymphedema questionnaire (GCLQ) will t
      take approximately 20-30 min to complete. The questionnaire for LEE included onset, severity,
      location, duration, and management. Patients will also questioned concerning deep vein
      thrombosis to exclude other causes of LEE. LEE is defined as subjective edema of lower
      extremity based on patients' complaint. LLL is defined based on a clinical diagnosis of
      lymphedema by a physician.
