  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the screening of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using
      plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA analysis would result in the down-staging of the NPC cases in
      asymptomatic individuals.

    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is an important etiological factor for nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (NPC). In a pilot study, we have shown that the analysis of Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV) DNA in blood can detect early and asymptomatic NPC. However, it is unlcear if NPC
      screening can improve the prognosis of the screened NPC subjects.

      20,000 male subjects aged from 40 to 62 will be recruited because the incidence of NPC is
      higher in this target group. Twenty millilitres of venous blood will be collected from each
      subject at enrolment for plasma EBV DNA analysis.

      Subjects who have initial positive results for plasma EBV DNA will have another testing at
      approximately 4 weeks. Subjects who have persistently positive results for the two plasma EBV
      DNA analyses will be investigated using nasal endoscopic examination and MRI of the
      nasopharynx.

      After the initial screening, all participants will be phone interviewed yearly to update
      their cancer status.

Subjects with positive results will be investigated using endoscopic examination and MRI. If the subject is confirmed of having NPC, the stage of the disease would be recorded.</description>
