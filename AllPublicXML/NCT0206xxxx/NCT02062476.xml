  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is able to exert long lasting effects in children with atopic
      disorders. We have shown that Nutramigen LGG accelerates tolerance acquisition in infants
      with cow's milk allergy (CMA). The mechanisms of these effects are still largely undefined.
      The effect of LGG could be related at least in part by the immunoregulatory role played by
      LGG. This probiotic can balance the generation of cytokines possibly involved in IgE- or
      non-IgE-mediated CMA (i.e., IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-γ , TGF-beta, and TNF-alfa), which can
      contribute to modulation of inﬂammatory processes. We have demonstrated that children with
      IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly higher level of IL-4 and IL-13 in response to cow's
      milk protein, and that tolerance is associated with a marked reduction of IL-13 production
      and a concomitant increased frequency of IFN-γ releasing cells.

      Epigenetics studies the heritable (and potentially reversible) changes of the genome
      inherited from one cell generation to the next which alter gene expression but do not involve
      changes in primary DNA sequences, highlighting the complexity of the inter-relationship
      between genetics and nutrition. There are three distinct, but closely interacting, epigenetic
      mechanisms (histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding microRNAs) that are
      responsible for modifying the expression of critical genes associated with physiologic and
      pathologic processes. The profile of epigenetic modifications associated with Th lineage
      commitment, coupled with the sensitivity of the early developmental period, has led to
      speculation that factors that disrupt these pathways may increase the risk of allergic
      diseases. Specifically, effects on DNA methylation and endogenous histone deacetylase
      inhibitors acting on specific pathways (Th1 and T regulatory cell differentiation) may favour
      Th2-associated allergic differentiation. MicroRNAs are another structural components of an
      epigenetic mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA translation. It has
      been recently identified a specific Th2-associated miRNA (miR-21) that is critical for the
      regulation of Th cell polarization.
