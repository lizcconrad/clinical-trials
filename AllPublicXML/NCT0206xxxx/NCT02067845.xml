  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The limited research that exists suggests that lesbian, bisexual and queer (LBQ) women are at
      similar risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI) as heterosexual women. This is a
      particularly important area to address, as literature highlights the convergence of sexual
      stigma and gender-based sexual violence as elevating LBQ women's risk for HIV and STI
      infection. However, recent Statistics Canada data indicated that: lesbians reported
      significantly lower rates of Pap testing than heterosexual or bisexual women; lesbians and
      bisexual women had higher odds of not having a regular doctor than heterosexual women; and
      bisexual women had higher reported unmet health care needs than lesbian and heterosexual
      women. These differences highlight the importance of implementing and evaluating
      interventions to address STI risk among LBQ women; however, no published study exists of this
      nature. A STI prevention intervention will be implemented with groups of LBQ women and WSW in
      Toronto and Calgary. The study has 5 distinct components: 1) key informant interviews to
      inform the development of the intervention training manual and survey questionnaire, 2)
      pre-test; 3) intervention (6 group sessions during a weekend retreat); 4) post-test directly
      following intervention, and 5) follow-up post-tests at 6 and 12 weeks. The study hypothesis
      is that, compared to pre-intervention, participants who receive the group-based intervention
      will report an increase in sexually transmitted infections (STI) knowledge post-intervention.
      The secondary hypotheses are that, compared with pre-intervention, participants will
      demonstrate higher mean scores of (a) safer sex self-efficacy; (b) STI testing; (c) safer sex
      practices; (d) resilient coping, (e) self-esteem, (f) social provisions, (g) community
      connectedness and (h) access to health care. We anticipated that compared to
      pre-intervention, participants post-intervention would report lower mean scores of (a)
      depression and (b) internalized stigma.

      This is a single-centre pragmatic N-of-1 pilot study. The target population is LBQ women in
      Calgary and Toronto, Canada. The authors aim to recruit 40 participants using purposive
      peer-driven recruitment methods. LBQ women from agencies that serve LBQ women will deliver
      the intervention. A survey will be conducted at pre and post-intervention to evaluate the
      impact of the intervention. Paired-sample t-tests will be used to assess pre- and post-
      intervention differences in sexual risk behaviour outcomes (safer sex practices, safer sex
      self-efficacy), protective factors (resilient coping, HIV/STI knowledge and testing) and
      social-structural determinants (social support, access to health care, internalized sexual
      stigma) directly following the intervention and 3 months post-intervention. Logistic and
      linear generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models will be used to assess
      intervention effects for the follow-up period of 3 months to control for repeated
      within-subject measurements.

    <description>The intervention will adapt the Many Men, Many Voices (3MV) group level intervention for MSM to address individual and social determinants of HIV/STI risk and vulnerability. This intervention involves 6 consecutive 2-3 hours sessions conducted at a weekend retreat. We will have 1 retreat in Calgary and 1 retreat in Toronto; each retreat will include 20 persons.
Based on the 3MV format, a draft template includes: Session 1: Intersectionality; Session 2: STI/HIV Prevention Among WSW and LBQ Women; Session 3: STI/HIV Risk Assessment and Prevention Options; Session 4: Relationship Issues; Session 5: Self-efficacy, Resilient Coping and Capacity for Change; Session 6: Social Support and Problem Solving to Maintain Change.
Delivery methods include discussion, role-plays and risk-reduction planning.</description>
