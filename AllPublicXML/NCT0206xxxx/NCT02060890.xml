  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's tumor genomic
      profiling consisting of whole genome sequencing, exome analysis, and RNA sequencing as well
      as predictive modeling. This new treatment strategy has shown promising results in adult
      patients with other solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent glioblastoma who are candidates for surgery for their clinical
      management will have tumor tissue taken at the time of surgery. Tissue samples will be
      obtained from the contrasting edge as well as infiltrating margins. Circulating tumor DNA
      will also be taken from blood samples before, and after surgery and every 2 months. Genomic
      profiling of the tumor tissue will be performed and a Molecular Tumor Board will review the
      profiling within 28 to 35 days of surgery. If specific potential targets are amenable to
      treatment, a treatment recommendation will be made. Up to 4 drugs could be suggested to the
      treating physician. The patient and the treating physician may or may not choose to use the
      recommendation. Any drug from the US Pharmacopeia may be chosen. If the treatment as
      suggested is given, patients will be followed for toxicity and efficacy, including
      progression and survival. If the treatment is not given, patients will be followed for
      progression and survival.

      Surgery is done and a &quot;core&quot; specimen (from the enhancing component of tumor) and one or more
      tissue biopsies of the surrounding &quot;rim&quot; are obtained and processed for shipment to TGen for
      NGS and transcriptome profiling.

      Blood is obtained prior to and 24 hours following surgery for assessment of any circulating
      tumor DNA in blood.

      Blood for circulating tumor DNA is collected every 28 days (+/- 7 days).

      Whole blood samples will be immediately sent to Ashion for extraction of DNA. Isolated DNA
      will be quantitated by spectrophotometry, and the distribution of molecular weights in the
      preparations will be visualized by gel electrophoresis. Blood derived DNA samples will be
      aliquoted and kept at Ashion at -20 degrees Celsius until use in molecular studies
