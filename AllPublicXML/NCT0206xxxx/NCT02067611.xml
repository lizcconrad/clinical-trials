  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind (with dose), placebo controlled,
      parallel group, proof of concept, and dose range finding study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and PK of X0002 spray in adult subjects with clinically symptomatic mild to moderate
      OA of the knee.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of X0002 spray compared to placebo for relief of knee pain in
           subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee;

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of X0002 when administered as a
           topical spray.

      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind (with dose), placebo controlled,
      parallel group, proof of concept, and dose range finding study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and PK of X0002 spray in adult subjects with clinically symptomatic mild to moderate
      OA of the knee.

      After a screening period of up to 3 weeks and radiographic evaluation of the target knee
      joint space, 225 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1
      ratio with a 2:1 ratio of active:placebo within each treatment group in a 1:1:1 ratio with a
      2:1 ratio of active:placebo within each treatment group (i.e., 2 subjects to active treatment
      and 1 subject to placebo):

      Group A: low dose of X0002, twice daily (BID, approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo
      (low dose), BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=25); Group B: middle dose of X0002, BID
      (approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo , BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) ;
      Group C: High dose of X0002, BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo, BID
      (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) .

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.

    <time_frame>4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Efficacy Endpoint is change from Baseline in the WOMAC (VAS) pain subscale score for the target knee at 4 weeks of treatment, and will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Treatment will be included as a fixed class effect and WOMAC Baseline pain subscale score as covariates. The primary comparisons of interest will be the difference between active Group A (low dose) and combined placebo, active Group B (middle dose) and combined placebo, and active Group C (high dose) and combined placebo.
Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics, as appropriate. No formal statistical analyses are planned.</description>

        <description>The Primary Efficacy Endpoint is change from Baseline in the WOMAC (VAS) pain subscale score for the target knee at 4 weeks of treatment, and will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Treatment will be included as a fixed class effect and WOMAC Baseline pain subscale score as covariates. The primary comparisons of interest will be the difference between active Group A (low dose) and combined placebo, active Group B (middle dose) and combined placebo, and active Group C (high dose) and combined placebo.
Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics, as appropriate. No formal statistical analyses are planned.</description>
