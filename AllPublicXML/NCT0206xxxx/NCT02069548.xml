    <textblock>
      This study addresses postures and range of motion in cervical dystonia (Spasmodic
      Torticollis). It uses 3D miniature and wireless motion captures sensors, and aims to increase
      the understanding of the biomechanics of the movement disorders of the cervical column in
      this pathology. In addition, the clinical state of cervical dystonia of the patients will be
      assessed, using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS). The
      investigators will compare the results between control and study groups.

        Study-group: 30 patients meeting the criteria for cervical dystonia (Spasmodic Torticollis)
        and without botulinum toxin injections during the last 6 previous months before baseline.
        Patients will be selected consecutively among the outpatients with movement disorder of 3
        study sites: Fondation OPH Rothschild, Salpetriere Hospital and Sainte-Anne Hospital
        (Paris)

        Control-group: 30 healthy volunteers matched in age (+/- 5 years) and gender with the 30 CD
        subjects. They will be selected in Sainte-Anne Hospital (Paris)
