    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies genetics in predicting risk of bisphosphonate-related
      osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer receiving zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid
      is an anti-resorptive drug used as part of cancer treatment. A serious side effect of these
      drugs is death of the jawbone, commonly called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the
      jaw (BRONJ). Genetic research may help doctors understand risk factors for BRONJ or who is
      more likely to get BRONJ and why.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a pharmacometric model to predict jawbone zoledronic acid (Zol) concentrations
      in oncologic patients by conducting a prospective cohort study of Zol pharmacometrics in
      BRONJ patients, measuring drug in plasma, urine, and jawbone tissue obtained during surgical
      treatment for BRONJ.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To clinically assess and validate our predictive pharmacometric model, and develop a risk
      model for BRONJ in oncologic patients receiving intravenous Zol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive zoledronic acid IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.

    <description>The magnitude of associations between the study variables and BRONJ status will be estimated. For categorical variables, the univariate association with each variable and with BRONJ will be determined using Wald's test of association. For continuous variables, the association with each variable and BRONJ will be determined using Wald's test. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate the risk of BRONJ for development of the final risk model.</description>
