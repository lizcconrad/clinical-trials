  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to test a new physio-therapeutic approach tailored to type 2 and 3
      Spinal Muscular Atrophy patients, based on physical training in swimming-pool. This specific
      exercise should promote motor skills of trained patients, as we have observed in different
      mouse models. Patient's motor skills will be assessed using different scales including MFM
      and Hammersmith.

      This clinical trial attempts to develop a new non-invasive motor scale with sophisticated
      instruments.

      This scale will be useful in future clinical trials on SMA, given the lack of sensitivity of
      currently available scales.

      In addition, the study attempts to validate a questionnaire on post-exercise physical
      well-being.

    <textblock>
      This multicenter study is based on a longitudinal assessment of the natural disease
      progression and on the effects of exercise protocol in a swimming pool. This study will
      compare patients to themselves after determining motor skills and the disease natural course
      for 12 months.

      The study will compare different scales (MFM, Hammersmith) to our new innovative scale based
      on non-invasive analysis of motor skills.

      30 patients will be enrolled and tested with MFM, Hammersmith and our non-invasive scale
      every 6 months for a total of 18 months due to the slow natural progression of the disease.

      Among these 30 patients, 10 patients will be selected to perform a 6 months training in a
      swimming pool, from 12 to 18 months after enrollment, in defined and reproducible conditions.

      These trained patients will finally be reassessed at 18 and 24 months to test the therapeutic
      effect of the training compared to the slope of the natural disease progression, and other
      parameters.

      Only patients who have undergone training in the swimming pool will be reevaluated at 24
      months (6 months post-training) to assess long term exercise effects.
