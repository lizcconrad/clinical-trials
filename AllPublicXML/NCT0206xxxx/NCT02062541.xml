  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Illness and hospitalisation, even of short duration, pose separate risks for
      permanently reduced functional performance in elderly medical patients. Functional assessment
      in the acute pathway will ensure early detection of declining performance and form the basis
      for mobilisation during hospitalisation and subsequent rehabilitation. For optimal results
      rehabilitation should begin immediately after discharge.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a systematic functional assessment in
      the emergency departments (ED) of elderly medical patients with reduced functional
      performance when combined with immediate post-discharge rehabilitation.

      Method/design: The study is a two-way factorial randomised clinical trial. Participants will
      be recruited among patients admitted to the ED who are above 65 years of age with reduced
      functional performance. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1)
      functional assessment and immediate rehabilitation; 2) functional assessment and usual
      rehabilitation; 3) usual assessment and immediate rehabilitation; 4) usual assessment and
      usual rehabilitation.

      Primary outcome: 30-second chair-stand test administered at admission and two weeks after
      discharge.

      We hypothesise that such assessment in the ED or/and immediate rehabilitation will result in
      sustained or improved performance in comparison to regimen in which neither of these
      interventions are offered.
