  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I, open-label, sequential-cohort, ascending multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of escalating doses of PDS0101 in female subjects with high-risk HPV
      infection and biopsy-proven CIN1. The study will include 3 cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects each
      based on a modified &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose-escalation study design. The study will be initiated with
      Cohort 1 and progress through Cohort 3, with each subsequent cohort receiving a higher dose
      of PDS0101. Successive cohorts will receive a constant dose of HPV-16 E6 and E7 peptides. All
      subjects will receive 3 vaccinations SC given approximately 21 days apart. Dosing and dose
      escalation will be based on safety evaluation for determination of potential dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT).

          4. Not pregnant based on a negative result on a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
             test at screening Visit 1 and a negative urine pregnancy test prevaccination at Visit
             2 (and at subsequent vaccination visits);

          5. Pap test documenting atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
             (ASCUS)/HPV+, atypical squamous cells high grade (ASC-H), low-grade squamous
             intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)
             within 4 months prior to screening Visit 1;

          6. History of pathologically confirmed CIN1 by colposcopically-directed punch biopsy,
             within 12 weeks prior to administration of first study vaccination (CIN 2/3 subjects
             will not be eligible);

          7. For the diagnosis of CIN1, has a documented satisfactory colposcopy, ie, the entire
             lesion as well as the entire squamocolumnar junction is visualizible by colposcopy;
