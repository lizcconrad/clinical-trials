    <textblock>
      The goal of the research study is to observe the clinical safety, effectiveness and patient
      satisfaction of the AXERA 2 Access System in subjects undergoing coronary angiographic and
      possible Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) through the femoral artery when compared to
      standard manual compression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single center 1:1 randomized controlled trial in subjects undergoing coronary
      angiography and PCI.

      It is anticipated that the enrollment period for this study will be two years.

      The post procedure follow up period is up to 37 days following the procedure.

          -  Subject has had prior vascular surgery or vascular grafts at the femoral artery access
             site.

          -  Subject presents with hemodynamic instability or is in need of emergent surgery.

          -  Subject has received femoral artery closure on the target access vessel with a
             collagen/PEG closure device within 90 days.

          -  Subject has a pre-existing severe non-cardiac systemic disease or illness that results
             in an expected life expectancy of &lt; 1 year.

          -  Subject is participating in an investigational drug or another device research study
             that interferes with the current research study endpoints.
