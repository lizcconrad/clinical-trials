  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the capacity of Dolutegravir + Rilpivirine
      vs. continued triple combination HAART to maintain plasma HIV RNA ≤ 50 copies/ml throughout
      24 weeks in patients with plasma HIV RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL for at least 2 years under
      conventional HAART (2 NNRTI + 3rd agent).

      The main secondary objectives are the following:

        -  % of virologic success (plasma viral load ≤ 50 copies/mL) at W24 and W48

        -  % of patients who maintain a plasma viral load ≤ 50 copies / ml from D0 to W48

        -  % of virological failure defined by two consecutive plasma viral load &gt; 50 copies/mL

        -  Profile of genotypic resistance in case of virological failure.

      The trial will be conducted according to the design below, in 3 steps:

        -  Step 1: enrollment of 80 patients (40 in each arm)

        -  Step 2: enrollment on hold until W16 data from the 40 patients enrolled in the
           intervention arm have been analyzed.

        -  Step 3: resumption and completion of enrollment if conditions for resuming enrollment at
           the end of step 2 are fulfilled, i.e. if the percentage of patients randomized to the
           intervention arm who have a plasma viral load ≤ 50 copies/mL from D0 to W16 is
           significantly &gt; 70%, which translates in a maximum of 6 virologic failures.
