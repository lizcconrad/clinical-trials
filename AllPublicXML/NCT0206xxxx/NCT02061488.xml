      The purpose of the study is to assess a new closed-loop algorithm in type 1 diabetes (Saddle
      Point Model Predictive Control : SP-MPC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients will be assessed during a closed-loop night and an open-loop night in random
      order.

      The primary objective is to assess the ability of SP-MPC controler to maintain euglycemia and
      avoid hypoglycaemia during the night, compared to open loop in type 1 diabetic patients
      treated by insulin pump.

    <description>During the closed-loop night glucose values measured by the sensor are collected every 15 minutes. The data are entered into the SP-MPC controler that calculate the insulin dose to be delivered. A diabetologist validates the insulin dose before the infusion (manually bolus infusion)</description>
