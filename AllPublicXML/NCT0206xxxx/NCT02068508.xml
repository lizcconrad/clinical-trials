      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment
      with pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) in in the routine clinical setting in combination with
      combination with an insulin product in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who responded
      inadequately when using an insulin product in addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy.

      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of newly co-administered
      pioglitazone tablets (Actos Tablets) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have
      poorly controlled blood glucose when using an insulin product in addition to diet therapy and
      exercise therapy; this survey is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of long-term
      use of pioglitazone tablets (Actos Tablets) in in the routine clinical setting in combination
      with combination with an insulin product (the planned sample size, 1000.) The usual adult
      dosage is 15 mg of pioglitazone administered orally once daily before or after breakfast.
      Dose adjustment will be made according to gender, age, and symptoms with an upper limit of 30
      mg.
