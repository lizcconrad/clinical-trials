    <textblock>
      Technologic advances in the field of radiation oncology have made in possible to deliver a
      highly conformal and accurate radiation dose to a target tissue. Accompanying the rapid
      implementation of these novel techniques is often a reduction in the radiation margins, which
      reinforces the importance of accurate target delineation, and reduces the side effect of
      therapy.

      F-18 FDG PET/CT is widely used in oncology, including complete whole body staging, restaging
      and monitoring of tumor response in different types of cancers. As to non-oncology
      application, inflammation in almost any tissue will result in increased FDG accumulation.
      However, the normal tissue with sparing radiation may show subtle change, and would be
      difficult to be detected. FDG PET/CT was limited in the spatial resolution of 5 mm and low
      FDG-avid disease. To be evaluation of the interval change of metabolic response before and
      after radiotherapy of thoracic malignancies, we plan to initiate a prospective study trail
      the takes advantages of recent technical advances of technique in 4-dimensional PET/CT (4-D
      PET/CT) with respiratory gating system.

      Respiratory motion creates artifacts in PET and PET/CT images, and can alter diagnosis. The
      tumor edge would be blurred due to respiratory movement, and be underestimated the uptake
      value. Also, semi-quantitative measurement, standard uptake value (SUV), combined with
      parameters such as the lesion site and shape, which is commonly used to make the final
      assessment of disease would be mis-estimated.

      The study aims to investigate the correlation of 4-D PET/CT with respiratory gating methods
      and free breathing PET/CT when processing primary thoracic malignancy and normal tissue
      effect.

      Radiation pneumonitis is the dose-limiting toxicity in thoracic radiotherapy (RT) for
      thoracic malignancy. It occurs beginning after the initiation of RT for up to 6 months
      characterized by cough, shortness of breath, and changes in lung function. A mortality rate
      approaches 50% in severe radiation pneumonitis [4]. Dosimetric parameters, such as the
      percentage of lung volume irradiated â‰§20 Gy (V20) and the mean lung dose (MLD), provide a
      guide to assess the risk of radiation pneumonitis in the treatment planning process. However,
      the parameters have poor predictive power for individual risk. The appearance of radiation
      lung injury shown in computed tomography (CT) was characterized by and early and a late
      phase. Since, radiation pneumonitis is characterized by the migration of leukocytes from the
      blood to irradiated lung tissue; thus, on FDG-PET imaging, more intense inflammatory
      responses will result in greater FDG uptake. Identifying an early sign or precursor of normal
      tissue damage helps predicting the delayed organ dysfunction.

      In combined PET/CT, CT is used for localization and correction for attenuation in the PET
      images. An accurate spatial registration of PET and CT image sets is a prerequisite for
      accurate diagnosis and SUV measurement. However, because of respiration, and the difference
      in the acquisition time required to image the thorax between PET (6-9 minutes) and CT (~15
      seconds), spatial misalignment between the 2 image sets is not uncommon. This misalignment
      significantly compromises the interpretation of PET images, resulting in mislocalization of
      the lesion and inaccurate quantitation of the SUV. The main cause of these artifacts is the
      dynamic interaction between transaxial image acquisition and the asynchronous motion of tumor
      and normal tissues. To account for motion effects, respiratory gating techniques have been
      developed.

      A more sophisticated respiratory-motion monitoring system is the Real-Time Position
      Management respiratory gating system (RPM). The system includes a video camera that measures
      respiratory motion by tracking the vertical displacement of 2 infrared reflective markers
      rigidly mounted on a plastic block placed on the patient's thorax. The motion of the block is
      displayed by a graphical interface on the RPM workstation. It has been used in gated
      radiotherapy of lung, respiratory-gated CT, and 4-D CT, as well as respiratory-gated PET
      imaging.

      We plan to enroll patients with thoracic cancer who scheduled further radiotherapy. Patients
      with pre-existing chronic lung disease, such as COPD, interstitial lung disease, cystic lung
      disease, et al, will be excluded. The FDG PET/CT will be performed before the radiotherapy
      (baseline study), and 30-45 days after completing radiotherapy (2nd study). Free-breathing
      whole body scan will be performed after 40 minutes, and regional 4D PET/CT with RPM method
      for chest was performed subsequently. These patients will be follow-up in radiation oncology
      clinics, any radiation-related adverse effect and long-term prognosis will be recorded. The
      association between the data analysis will be further investigated.

      We will obtain better delineation of the correlation and the differences between
      free-breathing PET/CT 4-D PET/CT with RPM respiratory-gating methods in processing tumor
      metabolism, more over, to assess normal tissue metabolic effect. And the further work is
      trying to find if the application helps in clinical outcomes and prediction of prognosis of
      the technique of 4-D PET/CT with RPM respiratory-gating methods.

    <description>The patient should be fasting prior to the exam for at least 6 hours. Before the radiopharmaceutical injection, we will take a sample of blood from a vein to test the blood sugar level. High levels of circulating glucose essentially compete with radioactive FDG in the exam, and image degradation may occur. Then F-18 FDG PET/CT study with 10 mCi tracer was injected from vein. All PET/CT studies were performed on the hybrid PET/CT scanner (Discovery VCT, General Electric Medical Systems).After uptake time of 60 minutes, whole body FDG PET from the vertex of the skull to the proximal thighs in 3D mode at 60 minutes after intravenous administration of FDG. After 60 minutes of the first imaging, delayed 4-D PET/CT with RPM respiratory gating method will be applied to lung fields. The time-points of FDG PET/CT are before radiotherapy (baseline study), and 30-45 days after completing radiotherapy (2nd study).</description>
