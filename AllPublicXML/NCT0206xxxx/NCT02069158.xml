    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib single arm, open-label, multiple dose, dose escalating, safety,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the combination of PF-05212384 with paclitaxel
      and carboplatin. The study will be conducted in adult patients with advanced breast, NSCLC,
      ovarian or endometrial, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and Head and Neck (HNSCC) cancer for
      whom there is an indication to the use of paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      Successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of PF-05212384 in combination
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin, starting at a dose level determined to be the 60% of single
      agent MTD.

      The study will consist of two parts: the dose finding part (Part 1) and the expansion part
      (Part 2).

      During Part 1 patients with breast, NSCLC, ovary and endometrial, small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC) and Head and Neck (HNSCC) cancer will be enrolled.

      During Part 2, only patients with ovarian cancer will be enrolled. In Part 1, a 3+3 design is
      employed. Once the MTD of the combination is defined in Part 1, Part 2 is performed for a
      better definition of the safety profile, of the potential antitumor activity and of the
      pharmacodynamic effects of the combination; it will be conducted in at least 12 patients with
      ovarian cancer.

      Approximately 40 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study overall.

             from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to the start of study
             medication, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at
             least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable.

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy (other than palliative radiotherapy to lesions that will
             not be followed for tumor assessment on this study, ie, non target lesions),
             biological or investigational agents within 4 weeks of the start of the study
             treatment (6 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosoureas).

          -  Any surgery (not including minor procedures such as lymph node biopsy, needle biopsy,
             and/or placement of port-a-cath) within 4 weeks of the start of the study treatment or
             not fully recovered from any side effects of previous procedures.

          -  Congestive heart failure within 6 months.

          -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome.

             Fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes).

          -  Any history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if currently have a
             pacemaker).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Current use or anticipated need for food or drugs that are known potent CYP3A4
             inhibitors. Because inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase PF- 05212384 exposure
             leading to a potential increases in toxicities, the use of known strong inhibitors
             (strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus
             fruits (eg, Seville oranges, pomelos), ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole,
             voriconazole, posaconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, verapamil,
             indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, atazanavir,
             amprenavir, fosamprenavir and delavirdine, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan) are
             not permitted from 10 days prior to the first dose of study drug until
             discontinuation. Concurrent administration of herbal preparations and current or
             anticipated need for food or drugs that are known substrates of UGT1A9 (eg, propofol,
             acetaminophen, and propranolol), of which PF-05212384 is a strong inhibitor, is not
             permitted from 10 days prior to the first dose of study drug until discontinuation.

          -  Current or anticipated need for food or drugs that are known potent CYP3A4 inducers.
             PF-05212384 metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg,
             phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine,
             St. John's Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co
             administration of study drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4
             inducers is not permitted from 10 days prior to the first dose of study drug until
             study treatment discontinuation.

          -  Breast feeding or intercurrent pregnancy; no use of highly effective contraception or
             not agreeing to continue highly effective contraception for 90 days after last dose of
             investigational product.

          -  Any mental disorder that would limit the understanding or rendering of informed
             consent and/or compromise compliance with the requirements of the protocol.
