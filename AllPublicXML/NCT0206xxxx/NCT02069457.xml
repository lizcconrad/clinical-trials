  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have confirmed that patients with cirrhosis possess an imbalance in
      procoagulant versus anticoagulant activity due to increased factor VIII and decreased protein
      C. Moreover, in the last two decades there has been an increased recognition that not only
      bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. The prevalence and
      pathogenesis of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis without
      hepatocellular carcinoma are not clearly defined. The Aim of this study is to assess the
      prevalence of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis without hepatocellular
      carcinoma, and to prospectively assess the risk factors, outcome, and prognosis in these
      patients. The investigators plan to enroll two hundred patients with liver cirrhosis. The
      patients are going to follow up for one year and evaluate at baseline and every 6 months by
      liver function tests, coagulation test, upper abdomen ultrasound. All relevant clinical
      events will be evaluated at every follow up.
