  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dactylitis is a poor prognostic factor in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients. The efficacy of
      synthetic or biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on dactylitis has not
      been previously studied in randomized controlled trials as a primary endpoint.

      In this investigator initiated clinical trial the investigators aim to test the hypothesis
      that the combination therapy of golimumab and methotrexate (MTX) will result in a significant
      improvement of dactylitis in comparison with MTX monotherapy, in MTX naïve psoriatic
      arthritis patients, at week 24. Similarly the efficacy on enthesitis, peripheral and axial
      involvement, skin and nail psoriasis, inflammation and damage of the feet and hands assessed
      by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), composite indexes of disease activity, remission,
      function and quality of life will be determined.

      This is a national multicentre, interventional, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel
      design trial. 136 patients with active dactylitis, refractory to at least two systemic
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at optimal dosage, for 3 months will be
      included and centrally randomized to golimumab in combination with MTX versus MTX
      monotherapy, in a 1:1 ratio. The study duration will be 24 weeks.

      The investigators expect the results from this trial will contribute to a better definition
      of the treatment algorithm of PsA patients with dactylitis.
