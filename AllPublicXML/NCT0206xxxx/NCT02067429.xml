      This study will compare toric intra-ocular lens (IOL) with limbal relaxing incisions (LRI) in
      correcting astigmatism in patient undergoing standard cataract surgery.

      Astigmatism is unequal curvature of the eye; the eye is oval rather than spherical.
      Uncorrected astigmatism of greater than approximately 0.75 diopters (D) can cause visual
      blurring, ghosting of images or halos. Over 20% of patients undergoing cataract surgery have
      astigmatism which is likely to have been corrected by spectacles.

      Cataract surgery involves the replacement of the natural opacifying crystalline lens with a
      clear artificial plastic intra-ocular lens (IOL). The lens power can be selected to correct
      the patient's glasses prescription. The most widely used IOLs only correct glasses at one
      distance i.e. either near or distance. Residual astigmatism after cataract surgery will need
      glasses for correction which is undesirable for many patients.

      Limbal relaxing incisions (LRI) are circumferential partial thickness cuts to the clear
      window of the eye (cornea) during surgery. These LRIs can correct corneal astigmatism and
      have no additional risk of complications.

      Alternatively, toric IOLs are available which correct astigmatism inside the eye. They have
      been available for routine use in the last few years; technology has markedly improved and
      the lenses have become cheaper.

      Studies have suggested toric IOLs provide better vision after cataract surgery than the
      regular IOLs. Toric IOL are widely used in the private practice and increasingly in the
      National Health Service (NHS). LRIs are cost effective for treating astigmatism however their
      predictability is believed to be lower than toric IOLs. As there are no randomised controlled
      trials comparing the outcomes between LRIs and toric IOLs. This research will address this
      gap in knowledge and accordingly from this research future practice will be able to provide
      treatment to patients with information about the best outcomes.
