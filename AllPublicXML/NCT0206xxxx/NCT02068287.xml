  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta adrenergic system, over-activated in septic shock patients, is a key modulator of the
      inflammatory response. Experimental works demonstrated that Esmolol, an highly selective
      beta-1 blocker, reduces heart rate and regulates the inflammatory response. A recent mono
      centric, double blind, randomized clinical work in septic shock patients has shown that
      Esmolol administration is safe and reduces effectively heart rate. However there are only
      sparse data on 1) regional and micro-circulation, 2) inflammation modulation in human
      resuscitated septic shock patients treated by esmolol.
