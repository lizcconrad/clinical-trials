  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of this trial will be to determine the safety and immune activity of HER-2
      pulsed DC1 vaccine in patients with high risk HER-2pos breast cancer with residual disease
      post neoadjuvant therapy. Investigators will also explore the possibility of determining
      whether circulating tumor cells can be used as surrogate to assess response to vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cell cancer vaccines combined with chemotherapy may increase complete responses
      giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the immune
      repertoire is being shifted by chemotherapy to anti-breast cancer response and offer the
      chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. There is a need
      to determine whether this ICAIT DC1 can activate CD4 and CD8 T cells prior to or in
      combination with chemotherapy with or without added trastuzumab.

      This study began at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and will be
      continued at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute.
