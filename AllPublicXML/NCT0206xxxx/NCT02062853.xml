  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of prospective patient education on
      patient satisfaction with administration of topical 5% 5-fluorouracil cream for the treatment
      of actinic keratosis involving the face, scalp, upper chest, dorsal hands and forearms.
      Specifically, this study aims to determine if prospective patient viewing of an educational
      video delineating treatment effects and expectations improves patient satisfaction and
      treatment completion rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of actinic keratoses with at least 6
             clinically-diagnosed actinic keratoses on the face, bald scalp, arms, upper chest, OR
             dorsal hands classified as grade I, mild (slightly palpable actinic keratoses, more
             easily felt than seen), and II, moderate (moderately thick hyperkeratotic actinic
             keratoses, easily felt).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients using interferon or interferon inducers, immunomodulators, cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressor drugs, corticosteroids, retinoids, or investigational drugs within 4
             weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who have been treated with any topical drug for actinic keratoses lesions
             less than 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with invasive tumors within the treated area (e.g. invasive squamous cell
             carcinoma)

          -  Patients who have exhibited any dermatological disease within the treated or adjacent
             (3 cm distance) area at the time of screening.

          -  Patients who have known allergies to fluorouracil (5-FU).
