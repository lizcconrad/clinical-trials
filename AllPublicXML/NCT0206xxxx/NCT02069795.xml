  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The waveform assessment of an athlete's speech production has a high probability of showing
      abnormalities after brain injury (concussions) which could be used not only for diagnosis of
      the concussion, but for recovery of the brain. The aim of this study is to investigate this
      possibility using the Cobweb automated application system for acoustic processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussions affect cognitive and fine muscle motor control, and these changes will be
      reflected in the acoustic characteristics of the vowels being produced. The methods to
      identify and analyze the acoustics of vowels will greatly extend the detailed understanding
      of vowels produced after a concussion. The identification of the changes in formant
      frequencies, pitch, and duration will provide the means to use these parameters as an
      automated diagnostic tool. The waveform assessment of the athlete's speech production has a
      high probability of showing brain abnormalities immediately after a suspected or diagnosed
      concussion at the venue of the athletic sport. The aim of this study assessment is to
      investigate this possibility using the Cobweb system and greatly enhance the ability to
      diagnose a concussion in a timely manner to remove the athlete from practice or play.
