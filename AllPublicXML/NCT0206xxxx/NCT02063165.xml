  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the role of a dietary oil to alter chronic disease
      risk factors in women who are at risk for heart disease and/or diabetes. The investigator's
      previous study showed that safflower oil reduced trunk fat mass in women with diabetes. The
      investigators believe safflower oil can also attenuate criteria of metabolic syndrome through
      reduction in trunk fat mass.

      The long-term goal is to develop effective and novel dietary and lifestyle strategies to
      reduce the progression of metabolic syndrome to chronic diseases such as coronary heart
      disease. The rationale for conducting this research study is that there are few effective
      strategies that target changes in body composition and metabolism as a means to attenuate
      metabolic syndrome. The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the
      overall objective of this research by pursuing the following three specific aims.

      Specific Aim 1: Quantify the extent that linoleic acid reduces trunk adipose mass in women
      with metabolic syndrome.

      Specific Aim 2: Measure changes in visceral adipose tissue

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the time-dependent effect of linoleic acid to increase adiponectin
      levels.
