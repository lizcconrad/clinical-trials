    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the effect that PAZ320 has on post-prandial
      glucose excursions measured via continuous glucose monitoring and its adverse effect profile
      in humans. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are minimally invasive devices that measure
      glucose levels in interstitial fluid. A small wire is inserted subcutaneously which transmits
      the ambient subcutaneous glucose concentration every 5 minutes to a wireless recorder. In
      usual use, the patient can see these data and graph the previous 1, 3 or 9 hours to identify
      trends or look back over time (ie over night). In our study, the patient will be blinded to
      the data so as not to confound results, as it has been noted in another study that patient's
      blood sugar control was better when they were able to see CGM results and modified their
      diet. CGM's have been shown to have clinical accuracies of 95.5-98.9% and have been used in
      clinical trials and found to be safe. Having the patient do a finger-stick glucose
      intermittently during the time they are wearing the CGM improves accuracy.
