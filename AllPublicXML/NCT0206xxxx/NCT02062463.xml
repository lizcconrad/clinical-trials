    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to assess whether training participants on proper use of BF SPIROMAX
      and Symbicort TURBOHALER will improve their device-handling technique and potentially improve
      their treatment outcome, ie, better asthma control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent signed and dated by the adult patient before conducting any
             study related procedures.

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of asthma in accordance with Global Initiative for Asthma
             (GINA) criteria as evidenced by a United Kingdom (UK) quality outcome framework
             approved Read code (UK diagnostic coding system).

          -  The patient is receiving step 3 or 4 therapy for asthma as defined by the British
             Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines (daily doses of BDP-equivalent inhaled
             corticosteroid (ICS) ≥800 mcg to 2000 mcg as part of fixed or free combinations with
             long-acting beta-agonists (LABA).

          -  If patient is a female of childbearing potential (postmenarche or less than 2 years
             post-menopausal or not surgically sterile) the patient must be willing to commit to
             using a medically accepted method of contraception for the duration of study and 30
             days after discontinuing study drug.

          -  The patient, as judged by the investigator, must be willing and able to understand
             risks and benefits of study participation to give informed consent and to comply with
             all study requirements as specified in this protocol for the entire duration of their
             study participation.

          -  The patient is SPIROMAX and TURBOHALER naïve (no use of a TURBOHALER device in the
             last 6 months, minimizing carryover from prior device use).

          -  If female, the patient must have a negative urine pregnancy test. o other criteria
             apply, please contact the investigator for additional information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any clinically significant uncontrolled medical condition (treated or
             untreated) that, in the judgment of the investigator, will cause participation in the
             study to be detrimental to the patient.

          -  The patient has participated in a Teva sponsored clinical study with BF SPIROMAX in
             the last 6 months.

          -  The patient is a pregnant, attempting to become pregnant, or breast feeding. (Any
             woman becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.)

          -  The patient has used a clinical trial investigational drug within 1 month before the
             screening visit.

          -  The patient has an ongoing asthma exacerbation or has received OCS and/or antibiotics
             for a lower respiratory condition (proxy measure for identifying an asthma
             exacerbation and/or lower respiratory infection, suggestive of altered inspiratory
             capabilities) in the 2 weeks preceding visit

          -  The patient is currently receiving any OCS (including long or short courses).

          -  The patient has a significant chronic lower respiratory tract disease other than
             asthma eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis or
             interstitial lung disease. Conditions that are not predominant, such as minor degrees
             of bronchiectasis, are not a reason for exclusion.

          -  The patient has a known allergy or severe sensitivity to the constituents of the study
             drugs (SPIROMAX or TURBOHALER) eg, to lactose or to milk protein.

               -  other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for additional information
