  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ERCP is associated with radiation exposure to the endoscopist and staff, which may be
      significant at high volume programs despite the use of lead aprons. We hypothesize that
      draping of the fluoroscopy image intensifier may significantly reduce staff radiation
      exposure and help achieve implementation of the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)
      principle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 consecutive ERCP procedures were randomly assigned to the
      radiation-attenuating or sham drape in a 1:1 ratio. There were 2 subjects, the endoscopists
      performing ERCP and the nurse assisting in the procedure.

    <description>Comparing the use of a lead-free protective drape containing bismuth and antimony and a sterile sham protective drape, radiation dose (RD) was measured at 3 different sites (endoscopist's eye (1) and thyroid (2), and assisting nurse's thyroid (3)) with personal dosimeters placed outside of eyeglass frames and the thyroid shield. The unit of measurement is each event. The subject was subjected to radiation during 100 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures.Both groups used standard of care lead protection.</description>
