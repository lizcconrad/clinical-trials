  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether glycemic control, as measured by change in HbA1c and
      frequency of hypoglycemia, is different between treatment with linagliptin (Tradjenta®) and
      basal insulin in long term care residents(LTC) with Type 2 diabetes(T2D). Patients with
      poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c &gt;7.5%) will be randomized to a 6-month intervention with
      linagliptin or glargine insulin (± metformin for both treatments). Our hypothesis is that
      treatment with linagliptin, a once daily DPP4-inhibitor, will result in similar improvement
      in glucose control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than insulin treatment in LTC
      residents with T2D. We will also determine differences in clinical outcome, resource
      utilization, and hospitalization costs between LTC residents with T2D treated with
      linagliptin and basal and correction insulin. We will compare differences in complications
      (infectious and non-infectious, neurological and cardiovascular events), emergency room
      visits and hospitalizations between groups during the 6 months of intervention.
