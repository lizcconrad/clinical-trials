  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 23-valent pneumococcal Polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) has been developed for children
      and adults to prevent pneumococcal diseases such as pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs),
      meningitis (inflammation of the brain lining), and septicemia (blood poisoning) since 2006 in
      China. Also, the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) is frequently administered to the children
      and adults. The main objective of this study is to show that both vaccines can safely be
      administered together without affecting the immune response of protecting against disease.
