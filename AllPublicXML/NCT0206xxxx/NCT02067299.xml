  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of JNJ-42847922 on sleep latency (latency to
      persistent sleep) in participants with major depressive disorder who are stably treated with
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor who suffer
      from insomnia (inability to fall asleep).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to
      test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study), randomized (the study
      medication is assigned by chance) 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants to 4
      different arms in a clinical study), and a single dose study. This study will consist of a
      screening phase (between 28 to 2 days prior to the study medication), a treatment phase of 4
      double blind study periods (2 days), and a follow-up phase (within 7 to 14 days after last
      dose of the study medication). Approximately 20 participants with major depressive disorder
      will participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts
      (groups) (Cohorts A, B, C, and D) to receive JNJ-42847922 (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) and
      placebo. Each cohort consists of 4 treatment periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4). Safety will be
      evaluated by the assessment vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory
      testing, physical examination, and neurological examination. The total duration of study
      participation for a participant will be approximately 9 to 10 weeks.

    <time_frame>Screening (Day -28 to Day -2), Day 1, and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale is ued to measure subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be measured directly for sleepiness. VAS will assess whether the participants were feeling sleepy during the first hour after wake-up by using a 10 cm line, having sleepy/tired and awake at either end. The scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a high score reflecting a high level of anxiety. This will be assessed on Days 1 and 2 of each treatment period (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4).</description>

    <time_frame>Screening (Day -28 to Day -2), Day 1, and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is made up of 16 pairs of alternative descriptors of mood and attention at either end of a 10 cm line. Participants were asked to rate their feelings at the time of assessment by indicating the point on the line which best represent their mood. Each item was scored by measuring the position relative to the left hand end of the line and levels of anxiety, sedation, and dysphoria were then calculated from the combined scores of selected items. The scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a high score reflecting a high level of anxiety, sedation or dysphoria. This will be assessed on Days 1 and 2 of each treatment period (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4).</description>

    <description>A pot string meter includes a string attached the waist of the participant and all body movements over a period of time are integrated and expressed as mm sway. In a stabilometric platform, the participant will be made to sleep on a firm surface for about 51.2 seconds each with first eyes open and then eyes closed.
