    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, 12-week, randomized, controlled, parallel group, Phase 4
      study to assess whether the morning administration of interferon beta 1a (Rebif®) leads to a
      lower severity of flu-like symptoms (FLS) as compared to the evening administration, in
      subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).
