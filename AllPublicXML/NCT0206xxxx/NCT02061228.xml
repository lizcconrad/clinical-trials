  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled open-label clinical trial to assess the effect of artificially
      induced endometrial injury and repair during ovarian stimulation on the clinical pregnancy
      rate of an antagonist downregulated in-vitro fertilisation cycle
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian stimulation, ultrasound and hormonal monitoring, ovulation induction, oocyte
      retrieval, embryology procedure, IVF and luteal support will be according to how they are
      normally performed in our centre.

      All women included will undergo artificial ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone (GnRH) antagonist downregulation with daily injections of either ganirelix or
      cetrorelix. Treating physicians will opt on which exogenous gonadotropins should be used
      according to the patient's profile and preference and can include either recombinant follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) or highly purified urinary human menopausal gonadotropin (HP-HMG).
      Ovarian stimulation will commence after it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant and
      has basal levels of oestradiol, progesterone, FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH). The
      stimulation will be monitored simultaneously by pelvic ultrasound and hormonal analysis
      (oestradiol, progesterone), starting on day 6 of stimulation and then every 1 to 3 days,
      according to the individual endocrine profile and follicular development.

      Final oocyte maturation will be triggered with either 5000/10000 IU of human menopausal human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 150 IU of recombinant hCG when more than 2 follicles of ≥17
      mm are present. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after hCG administration under
      either local anaesthesia with analgesic premedication or general anaesthesia, according to
      patient preference.

      IVF or IVF/intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed, using the specimen of
      sperm made available by the male progenitor on the day of oocyte retrieval. According to
      embryo quality, embryo transfer to the uterine cavity will be performed on either the 3rd or
      5th day of development under ultrasound guidance whenever possible. Following embryo
      transfer, luteal support will be provided with vaginally administered progesterone 200 mg
      tid.

      For clarity, cycle cancelation is defined as any interruption of the ART process that occurs
      before fresh embryo transfer. Cycle cancelation will occur a) upon patient request, b) if
      inadequate follicular development occurs, c) if no embryo is available for transfer.

    <description>Sample size calculation was based on the adequate sample which would simultaneously 1) allow two safety-check interim analyses (at one-third and two-thirds of recruitment) and 2) have an 80% power to detect an increase of 15% in clinical pregnancy rate (from 32% to 47%) in the intervention group [using a two-side Fisher-exact test with a significance level (alfa) of 0.05]. Using a 1:1 randomisation ratio, each group would require approximately 180 patients, adding up to a total of 360 patients required for the trial.</description>

    <description>Women in the intervention group will undergo an endometrial biopsy on the 6th day of ovarian stimulation using a Pipelle de Cornier® (CCD International, Paris, France). This class I individually and sterile-packaged medical device, complies with Directive 93/42/European Economic Community (EEC) and is routinely used in our centre for endometrial sampling. It is comprised of a flexible disposable polypropylene suction cannula with an outer diameter of 3.1 mm and a 2.4 mm diameter opening on the distal end, on one side of the cannula. An inner plunger creates a vacuum essential for the blind endometrial biopsy. After the introduction of the Pipelle into the uterine cavity, it will be rotated 360 degrees and moved up and down four times after withdrawing the piston.</description>
