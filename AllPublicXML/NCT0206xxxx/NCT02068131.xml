      This is a Phase Ⅱ exploratory clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for injection plus
      capecitabine in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after
      standard therapy.

      All patients will receive recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for injection and
      capecitabine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged above 18 years.

          -  Pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. All other
             histological types are excluded.

          -  Failure of Second-Line and more than second-line treatment, and fluoropyrimidine- and
             irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-containing regimens.(Subjects who progress during or
             within 3 months following the last administration of approved standard therapies and
             terminate standard treatment due to unacceptable toxicity warranting.).If recurrence
             and metastasis occurred within 6 months after discontinuation of adjuvant
             chemotherapy, the adjuvant chemotherapy is considered to be first-line
             treatment.Subject received last-line treatment not including capecitabine.

          -  At least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria that has not been
             previously local treated. Minimum indicator lesion size as follows: greater than or
             equal to 10 mm measured by spiral CT or NMR.Malignant lymph nodes short diameter as
             follows: greater than or equal to 15 mm measured by spiral CT.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Minimum of 4 weeks since any local radiotherapy or surgery for the control of symptoms
             or severe complications(local radiotherapy for the control of bone metastases is not
             the limit)，and adequately recovered from toxicities of any prior therapy).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with novaferon.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding women or women who may be pregnant were positive drug test
             before administration.

          -  Patient of child-bearing potential(male or less than 1 year postmenopausal women) were
             reluctant to take contraceptive measures.

          -  Patient who were allergic to Interferon-α or who had interferon-α antibody.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
