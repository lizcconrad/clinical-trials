      The goal of this study is to understand how ipilimumab is being used, its safety profile, and
      the manner in which Adverse Reactions are managed in routine clinical practice. Another goal
      is to identify predictive biomarkers. The study is an observational study and not intended to
      test any hypothesis, but can be hypothesis generating.

      In Norway ipilimumab (Yervoy®) has been available for treating patients with advanced,
      locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, but was not approved for reimbursement until
      recently. The Department of Health and Social Services decided that in Norway a national
      Phase IV interventional study examining survival and Quality of Life should be performed. In
      addition a research project should be launched aiming at isolating biological markers to
      identify patients who would benefit the most from ipilimumab therapy.

      Because ipilimumab is a new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action, it is
      important to understand the scope of its impact once being widely available as a treatment
      option, i.e. real-world experience. Treatment guidelines and clinical research provide
      information on how unresectable or metastatic melanoma is to be treated with ipilimumab and
      how Adverse Events should be managed, but may not reflect what actually occurs in clinical
      practice compared to controlled trials.

      The results of the study will provide a more extensive understanding of the safety profile of
      ipilimumab in oncology practices in Norway in patients who may differ substantially from
      those included in the clinical trial program. In addition, the study results will provide
      information on how treatment patterns, patient-reported outcomes, clinical outcomes such as
      survival and disease progression may be influenced by ipilimumab. The proposed study
      objectives are: assessment of the safety of ipilimumab and analysis of health outcomes, in
      routine clinical practice, to ensure appropriate patient and provider utilization of
      ipilimumab.
