      1.1. Primary Objectives

      1. To determine if nab-paclitaxel and temozolomide can be combined with full dose of
      bevacizumab for the therapy of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases of metastatic
      malignant melanoma.

        -  To define the MTD of the combination (Phase I component).

        -  To determine progression free survival (Phase II component). 1.2. Secondary Objectives

             1. To separately evaluate the response rate and duration of both the brain and
                extra-cranial systemic metastases.

             2. To define the toxicity of the regimen.

             3. To tabulate the toxicity of the radiotherapy to the brain and compare with known
                toxicities of radiotherapy to the brain in melanoma and brain metastases.

             4. To use the data generated to plan definitive controlled clinical trials of the
                combination.

             5. To determine the overall response rate (Phase II component).

             shift.

          -  Inoperable or metastatic extra cranial stage III or IV disease.

          -  Measurable metastases to the brain, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10
             mm in the brain MRI/CT scan.

          -  CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis or PET CT scan performed within 28 days of study
             registration. For disease outside the brain, tumors must be &gt; 10 mm by CT scan.
