    <textblock>
      Acute renal injury is a common complication of critical illness. Drug induced renal insult
      compounds the degree of injury in many patients, and a great deal of research has focused on
      prevention of this complication. Traditional biomarkers of renal injury like serum creatinine
      and blood urea nitrogen content fail to consistently predict harm among patients at risk.
      Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1) will be studied as a biomarker of renal injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients are male or female adults ≥18 years of age with an expected hospital
             stay of at least 48 hours.

          -  Eligible patients are already prescribed intravenous vancomycin or linezolid per their
             primary care providers as a standard of care and dosed in manner that is consistent
             with current institutional practices. Receipt of these antibiotics is not
             investigational.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include patients who have stage 3or greater Chronic Kidney
             Disease or who have acute kidney injury prior to the start of intravenous vancomycin
             therapy, patients that only receive one dose of IV vancomycin or linezolid in total,
             as well as patients with potentially altered pharmacokinetic parameters (pregnant
             patients, burn patients, and those that are morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2).

          -  Additionally, patients will be excluded if they are to receive more than 1 concurrent
             nephrotoxic medication within the prior 72 hours, have received intravenous contrast
             within 120 hours before randomization, exhibit baseline hematuria, or baseline
             proteinuria.

          -  A list of concurrent nephrotoxins that would exclude patients from the study is
             provided in Appendix C.

          -  Age Range: ≥18 years of age, if age &gt; 90 will report as &gt; 90 years
