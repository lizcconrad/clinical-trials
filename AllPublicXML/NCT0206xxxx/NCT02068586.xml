  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well sunitinib malate or valproic acid works in
      preventing high-risk uveal (eye) melanoma from spreading to other parts of the body.
      Sunitinib malate may stop the transmission of growth signals into tumor cells and prevents
      these cells from growing. Valproic acid may change the expression of some genes in uveal
      melanoma and suppress tumor growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To assess the efficacy of adjuvant sunitinib malate or adjuvant valproic acid used for 6
      months to improve overall survival (OS) at 2 years in patients with high-risk uveal melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the efficacy of adjuvant sunitinib malate and adjuvant valproic acid used for
           6 months in preventing the development of distal metastases (relapse-free survival, RFS)
           in patients with high-risk uveal melanoma.

        2. To confirm the safety and tolerability of 6 months of adjuvant sunitinib and adjuvant
           valproic acid in patients with high-risk uveal melanoma.

        3. To assess the quality of life during the adjuvant treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To determine whether blood myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) concentration and
      other inflammatory cytokines correlates with OS and RFS.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) daily for 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive valproic acid PO daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
