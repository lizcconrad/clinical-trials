  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with head and neck cancer or benign tumours of the head and neck receive
      radiotherapy to their neck as part of their treatment. The carotid arteries are often
      included in the radiotherapy as collateral structures. There is some evidence to show that
      radiotherapy to these blood vessels can result in thickening of the artery walls some years
      after treatment and increased risk of stroke or TIA in the future.

      Current research is now aimed towards detecting radiotherapy-related changes to the carotid
      arteries at an earlier stage and towards using new radiotherapy techniques to avoid treating
      these blood vessels if possible. The question of whether or not the use of preventive
      medicines like aspirin and cholesterol-lowering tablets helps to reverse this process is
      currently unanswered.

      The aim of this study is to measure the thickness (intima-medial thickness) of irradiated
      carotid artery walls and compare this to unirradiated arteries. There are many other causes
      for thickening of arteries (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and
      diabetes) and these may affect the ability to measure the effect of radiotherapy change to
      the artery wall. In order to address this, it is ideal to look at this process in patients
      who have only had one side of their neck treated and use the other side as a comparison. The
      study will also be looking for earlier signs of radiotherapy-related changes, such as
      stiffening of the artery wall, inflammation in the artery wall (a very early sign of
      radiotherapy-related change) and some markers in the blood that may indicate that this
      process is taking place.

      The null hypotheses of this study are:

        -  In irradiated carotid arteries, the mean intimal-medial thickness will be the same
           compared to unirradiated arteries.

        -  Serum biomarkers will not be elevated in radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis.

        -  Development of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis is not affected by risk factor
           modulation (Aspirin, HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, smoking cessation).

        -  There is no difference in carotid arterial wall strain in irradiated carotid arteries
           versus unirradiated carotid arteries.

        -  Microbubble ultrasound will not be able to detect Inflammation in the carotid arteries
           as an early marker of atherosclerosis.
