  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by reversible
      obstruction, inflammation and hyperresponsiveness to different stimulus. Aerobic and
      breathing exercises have been demonstrated to benefit asthmatic patients; however, there is
      no evidence comparing the effectiveness of the treatments. Objective: To compare the effects
      of aerobic and breathing exercises on clinical control (primary outcome), psychosocial
      morbidity and daily life physical activity (secondary outcome) in patients with
      moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. In addition, thoracoabdominal kinematics, heart rate
      variability and airway and systemic inflammation will be evaluated. The initial hypothesis
      will be that both exercises present improved clinical control of asthma. Methods: Forty-eight
      asthmatic adults will be randomly divided into 2 groups: aerobic (AG) and breathing exercises
      (BG). All treatments will be performed twice a week for 3 months, totalizing 24 sessions of
      40 minutes each. Both groups will complete an educational program consisting of 2 classes at
      the beginning of the interventions. Before and after interventions, the following parameters
      will be quantified: clinical control, health related quality of life, levels of anxiety and
      depression, maximal exercise capacity, autonomic nervous imbalance, daily living physical
      activity, thoracoabdominal kinematics, inflammatory cells in the sputum, fraction of exhaled
      nitric oxide (FENO) and systemic inflammatory cytokines. Asthma symptoms will be quantified
      monthly using diaries. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to analyze the data normality,
      and a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc test (Student Newman
      Keuls) will be used to compare the inter and intra-groups differences

      Both groups completed an educational program that consisted of two classes held once a week,
      each lasting 2 hours. Presentations and group discussions were done, including information
      about asthma pathophysiology, medication skills, self-monitoring techniques, and
      environmental control and avoidance strategies.

    <description>It will be based on Yoga´s breathing technique (Eliade, 1996) and will be focus on to stimulate nasal and diaphragmatic breathings, to increase expiratory time, to slow respiratory flow and to regulate the breathing rhythm. Breathing exercises will be divided into 3 phases (lasting one month each) with progressive intensity every 8 sessions and will be part of the routine of breathing exercises the following exercises: I) Kapalabhati ; II) Uddhiyana ;III) Surya Bedhana</description>

    <description>Exercise will be performed on a treadmill, with the initial intensity of 60% of the maximum predicted heart rate for patient´s age (Tanaka et al, 2001) reaching a maximal of 80% during the training. The intensity values will be calculated using Karvonen's formule (1957).Aerobic training sessions that will consist in 40 minutes divided in 5 minutes of warm-up, 35 minutes of aerobic training and 5 minutes of cool down. Exercise intensity will be increased if the patient do not present any increase in asthma symptoms during the exercise for 2 consecutive training days. The program will be performed twice a week, for 3 months.</description>
