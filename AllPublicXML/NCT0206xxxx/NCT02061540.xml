    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration until Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study or use of investigational drug product, whether or not the AE was considered to be related to the investigational drug product. TEAEs were AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of investigational product and started prior to the last dose of investigational product plus 14 days.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus as Measured by Adult Itch Reported Outcome (ItchRO) Weekly Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult ItchRO instrument was completed twice daily using an electronic diary (eDiary). Each morning and evening score had a range from 0-10, with the higher score indicating increasing itch severity. The following was used for assessing the Adult ItchRO daily score: The score which represented the most severe itching for the day (morning or evening) was taken for each day as the daily score (maximum daily score of 10); If only 1 of the 2 scores was available for the day, the score that was available was used as the daily score; If both the morning and the evening scores were missing, the score was considered missing for the day.</description>

             activity score.

          4. Patients receiving azathioprine for intestinal bowel disease are eligible to

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study or use of investigational drug product, whether or not the AE was considered to be related to the investigational drug product. TEAEs were AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of investigational product and started prior to the last dose of investigational product plus 14 days.</description>

Each morning and evening score had a range from 0-10, with the higher score indicating increasing itch severity. The following was used for assessing the Adult ItchRO daily score: The score which represented the most severe itching for the day (morning or evening) was taken for each day as the daily score (maximum daily score of 10); If only 1 of the 2 scores was available for the day, the score that was available was used as the daily score; If both the morning and the evening scores were missing, the score was considered missing for the day.</description>
