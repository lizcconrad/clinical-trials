      Study CLO 290 was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 2 arm parallel
      group study of Clonidine Gel in the treatment of pain associated with PDN. Subjects were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 treatments applied topically TID to both
      feet for 85 days: Clonidine Gel (3.9 mg of clonidine HCl total daily dose), or Placebo Gel
      (vehicle without clonidine). Approximately 140 adult subjects with symmetrical distal PDN
      were expected to be randomized into the study. However, a pre-planned fully blinded interim
      analysis was performed when 70 subjects had completed the study for the purpose of re
      estimating sample size. Following the recommendation of the independent, third party
      statistician who conducted the interim analysis, the sample size was adjusted to allow
      approximately 260 subjects to be randomized into the study.

      The study included 5 phases: Screening Phase (up to 21 days duration), Baseline Phase (Day 14
      to Day 8), Placebo Lead in Phase (Day -7 to Day 1), Double blind Treatment Phase (85 days),
      and a Post-treatment Follow up Phase (7 days, only for subjects not enrolling in the open
      label long term safety study, CLO 311).

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a single reading that measures the patients interpretation of their pain on a scale from 0, no pain to 10, worst pain imaginable. The change from baseline can range from -10 to 10. The change from Baseline (averaged over Day -14 to Day -8) to End-of-Treatment (averaged over Days 78 to 84 [±3 days]) in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale score assessing the &quot;average pain in the past 24 hours in the painful areas of the feet&quot; averaged over Days 78 to 84 compared to the 7 days at the Baseline Phase (Days -14 to -8). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change in pain intensity from Baseline to Week 12 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline pain intensity score serving as a covariate. The statistical model also included treatment, site, site by treatment interaction, and strata. If the site by treatment interaction term was not significant at the 0.1 level, then it was excluded from the model.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has provided written informed consent.

          -  The subject is an outpatient aged 18 to 85 years (inclusive) at the time of the
             Screening Visit.

          -  The subject has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus with glycemic control that has been
             optimized and has been stable on diet therapy, oral anti-hyperglycemic agents and/or
             insulin, for at least three (3) months prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  The subject must be a male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female. Females must be
             practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or be surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal (amenorrhea for ≥12 months). Non-pregnancy will be confirmed (as
             applicable) by a pregnancy test conducted at the Screening and Randomization Visits.
             Double-barrier methods, hormonal contraceptives, and abstinence are acceptable birth
             control methods for this study.

          -  The subject has chronic pain attributable to a symmetrical stocking distribution
             neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least three (3) months. A loss of distal
             sensation and/or tingling paresthesia primarily in the toes and fingers is acceptable,
             but must be of secondary importance to the distal neuropathic pain. Pain should be
             clearly localized to the area of neuropathy (feet) and subjects should be able to
             distinguish this pain (the target pain) from other painful areas and conditions.

          -  The subject has an average pain score relevant to the target pain in the feet of ≥4 on
             an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the previous 24 hours at Screening.

          -  The subject has a pain score of at least 2, on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale
             , within 30 minutes following topical 0.1% capsaicin application with occlusive
             dressing to the pretibial area.

          -  The subject has a mean daily average pain score relevant to the target pain in the
             feet of ≥4 on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale during the Baseline Phase.

          -  The subject has met the pain evaluation and scoring criteria at the end of the Placebo
             Lead-in Phase by having a mean daily average pain score relevant to the target pain in
             the feet of ≥4 on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale without having a decrease in
             their pain score greater than 20% compared to the Baseline Phase score in the 11-point
             Numeric Pain Rating Scale .

          -  The subject has been medically stable for at least 30 days prior to the Screening
             Visit, and in the opinion of the Investigator, is in otherwise good general health
             based on medical history, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory evaluation.

          -  If taking chronic oral pain medications, the subject must be on a stable regimen for
             at least 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit with the expectation that the
             medications, dose(s) and schedule will remain stable throughout the study. For
             medications containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin,
             subjects must be on a stable dose for at least 7 days prior to the Baseline Visit. As
             needed pain medications will be limited to acetaminophen from Day -8 until the end of
             the treatment period. Low dose aspirin (81 mg/day) is not considered as analgesic
             therapy.

          -  Subject is compliant with daily pain assessments during the Baseline Phase and Placebo
             Lead in Phase of the study by recording their Numeric Pain Rating Scale score at least
             5 days and the last 3 days of the previous 7 days.

          -  Subject is alert and has the capabilities of applying topical gel to both feet three
             times daily. A caregiver, trained by the study staff to apply study drug, would be a
             suitable alternative to self-application of the treatment.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 84 (Week 12) in Numeric Pain Rating Scale Score</title>
        <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a single reading that measures the patients interpretation of their pain on a scale from 0, no pain to 10, worst pain imaginable. The change from baseline can range from -10 to 10. The change from Baseline (averaged over Day -14 to Day -8) to End-of-Treatment (averaged over Days 78 to 84 [±3 days]) in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale score assessing the “average pain in the past 24 hours in the painful areas of the feet” averaged over Days 78 to 84 compared to the 7 days at the Baseline Phase (Days -14 to -8). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change in pain intensity from Baseline to Week 12 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline pain intensity score serving as a covariate. The statistical model also included treatment, site, site by treatment interaction, and strata. If the site by treatment interaction term was not significant at the 0.1 level, then it was excluded from the model.</description>

        <title>Mean Daily Worst Pain Intensity Numeric Pain Rating Scale Scores</title>
        <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a single reading that measures the patients interpretation of their pain on a scale from 0, no pain to 10, worst pain imaginable. The change from baseline can range from -10 to 10. The change from Baseline (worst score from Day -14 to Day -8) to End-of-Treatment (worst score during Days 78 to 84 [±3 days]) in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale score assessing the “worst pain in the past 24 hours in the painful areas of the feet” from Days 78 to 84 compared to the 7 days at the Baseline Phase (Days -14 to -8). For the endpoint, the change in worst pain intensity from Baseline to Week 12 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline worst pain intensity score serving as a covariate. The statistical model also included treatment, site, site by treatment interaction, and strata. If the site by treatment interaction term was not significant at the 0.1 level, then it was excluded from the model.</description>
