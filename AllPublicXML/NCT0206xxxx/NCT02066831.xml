      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of telemedical coaching versus telemedical
      control on HbA1c, weight, BMI, blood pressure, blood lipids, medication, nutrition, physical
      activity and quality of life in type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycaemic control.

    <description>Patients will receive telemedical devices i.e. for the measurement of blood glucose, weight and physical activity. These devices will transfer the data to a data collector with a SIM card which sends the data to a data portal, which can be monitored by the participant and the coach. Health coaches which will have close phone contact to patients, supporting them to reduce weight and increase physical activity. In the first 12 weeks, patients will follow a formula diet (Almased) to achieve an initial weight reduction.</description>
