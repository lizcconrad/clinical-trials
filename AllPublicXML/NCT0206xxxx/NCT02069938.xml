  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been used to control a number of virtual
      and physical objects through the voluntary modulation of brain rhythms. Current issues with
      noninvasive BCIs include exhausting motor imagery tasks and long training times required to
      achieve competent control. The investigators will address these issues within this protocol,
      examining new approaches to reduce the effort required by subjects to control a physical
      object in the task.

      The PI's hypothesis is: Control of a physical robotic device will increase the performance of
      subjects in BCI tasks that are analogous to virtual tasks due to greater engagement with a
      physical output.

      Subjects will be recruited to participate in controlling a physical robotic device such as a
      quadcopter or a robotic arm using imagination of movement or other activities as detected by
      brain waves that can be used to control a robotic device.

      The subjects will be able to observe the controlling of a robotics device using one's thought
      and participate in multiple sessions to learn the skills to better control such a device.

    <description>Accuracy and performance metrics of Brain-Computer Interface tasks over time. This will include the percent of trials correct, percent of trials completed, and time to completion within each session. Combining these metrics, we will examine subject learning over sessions with regression. Exact time frame of sessions will be determined by subject and equipment availability.</description>
