  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pain survey study that will compare the level of discomfort experienced by breast
      cancer patients after injection of either technetium-labeled sulfur colloid or
      technetium-labeled tilmanocept, both FDA-approved agents used for sentinel lymph node biopsy
      (SLNB). Breast cancer patients who are already scheduled for SLNB as part of their original
      surgical plan will be asked to participate in this study and be randomized to receive either
      technetium-labeled sulfur colloid or technetium-labeled tilmanocept. After injection,
      patients will complete pain questionnaires to measure the amount of discomfort they are
      feeling during and after they receive the injection. There will be no change to the patient's
      treatment plan other than the addition of pain questionnaires. The investigators' hypothesis
      is that patients will feel less discomfort after injection of tilmanocept versus sulfur
      colloid.

    <time_frame>15,30,60 minutes after injection</time_frame>
    <description>After injection of sulfur colloid or tilmanocept, patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy imaging (as is standard of care for sentinel lymph node mapping) at 5, 30, and 60 minutes. We will analyze the time it takes for sentinel lymph nodes to appear on these images comparing tilmanocept versus sulfur colloid.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of biopsy-proven primary breast cancer or a diagnosis of
             pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who will be undergoing intraoperative lymphatic
             mapping as part of their standard surgical plan.

          -  The patient has provided written informed consent before participating in the study,
             as has his/her responsible caregiver, if applicable.

          -  The patient is a candidate for surgical intervention, with lymph node mapping being a
             part of the surgical plan.

          -  The patient is greater than 18 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  The patient has an performance status of Grade 0 - 2.

          -  The patient has a clinical negative node status at the time of study entry.

          -  If the patients is of child bearing potential, the patient has a negative pregnancy
             test within 72 hours prior to administration of radiopharmaceutical, has been
             surgically sterilized, or has been postmenopausal for at least 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating.
