  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of electro-acupuncture in pain processing on
      patients with fibromyalgia (FM). The investigators hypothesize that electro-acupuncture is
      effective for FM because it functions as a desensitization therapy, which when applied
      repeatedly over multiple treatment sessions, gradually habituates the nervous system to
      continuing pain and sensory signaling.

      This study design has two components: 1) a cross sectional assessment of brain chemistry,
      connectivity and response to pain in healthy controls and age- and sex-matched fibromyalgia
      patients, and 2) a longitudinal assessment of the same outcomes in fibromyalgia patients
      randomized to either electro-acupuncture or laser acupuncture.

      The investigators will evaluate 80 fibromyalgia patients who will receive acupuncture
      treatment twice a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 8 treatments. Baseline data from these
      patients will be compared to results from 20 pain-free controls.

      Participants will undergo experimental pain assessments as well as brain neuroimaging.

        Inclusion Criteria for Fibromyalgia Participants

          -  Have a Fibromyalgia diagnosis for at least one year and also meet the Wolfe et al 2011
             criteria for Fibromyalgia.

          -  Continued presence of pain more than 50% of days.

          -  Pain greater than a certain threshold on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain; 7-day
             recall; [Note: The VAS is widely used in clinical pain research and as such we chose
             to use it for inclusion criteria and for clinical pain assessment below. Within our
             group numerical ratings scales 0-100 are more commonly used in quantitative sensory
             assessment, and as such we chose to use NRS scales for evoked pain assessments below.]
