  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is widely one of the three commonly detected refractive errors. Myopia is usually
      managed by correction through glasses or contact lenses. Other alternative available include
      surgery, drugs and acupuncture. There are various therapeutic approaches and different points
      can be used in acupuncture treatment for myopia, such as auricular acupuncture, acupressure
      body acupuncture. However, the mechanism of acupuncture therapy for myopia is largely
      unknown. Furthermore, little information exists regarding the effects and safety of
      acupuncture for degenerative myopia in children.

      The investigators aimed to assess the overall effectiveness, safety of periocular acupressure
      for children with myopia

      The hypotheses of this study are as follows:

      Periocular acupressure is effective for myopia progression delay.

      The study aims to include 56 participants.
