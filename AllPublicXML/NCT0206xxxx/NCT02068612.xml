  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiological and neurocognitive changes experienced as a result of increasing age may
      influence socioemotional functioning and economic behaviors, yet, the mechanisms through
      which these changes occur are not well understood. Studies have also shown that aerobic
      exercise may protect against age-related cognitive decline in other domains. This research is
      designed to test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise will enhance social, emotional and
      economic functioning in older adults, and that these effects will occur via the effect of
      exercise on neurocognitive structure and function assessed via magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). Advancing our knowledge of the mechanisms that influence emotional, social and
      economic functioning could inform the development of targeted treatments and prevention
      programs for older adults.

    <description>Functional connectivity is measured via having participants lie in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner and passively stare at a centrally-positioned fixation crosshair for 8 min while their brain activity is recorded.
Executive function will be measured with 3 tasks characterized by the three domains of executive function: updating, shifting, and inhibition. For updating, we will utilize the Keep Track task,for shifting, we will use the Category Switch Task, and for inhibition we will use the Stroop task.</description>
