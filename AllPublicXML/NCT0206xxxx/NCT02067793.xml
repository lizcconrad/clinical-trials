  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NRX-1074 is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor functional partial agonist with efficacy
      in animal models of affective disorders including major depressive disorder. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of NRX-1074 at dose levels that are predicted
      by comparison of human and animal pharmacokinetics to be efficacious.
