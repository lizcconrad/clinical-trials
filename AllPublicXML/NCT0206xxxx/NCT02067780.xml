  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common diseases in the world.
      In a recent study, we showed that administration of levofloxacin is superior to placebo in
      the treatment of decompensation of COPD; it is accompanied by a substantial reduction in
      mortality and a significant reduction in the residence time in hospital.

      In Tunisia, few data are available on the epidemiology of COPD decompensation. The choice of
      antibiotic to be used in this situation is challenging to the clinician who must choose
      between traditional antibiotics (cyclins, aminopenicillins, cotrimoxazole...) and new
      antimicrobial agents. Recently, it has been emphasized the selection of patients for
      treatment according to the degree of systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein). Indeed,
      there would have a correlation between the tracheobronchial infection and elevated
      inflammatory markers. As the elevation of these markers is proportional to the intensity of
      the inflammatory reaction of the body, is based on the kinetics of these biomarkers in
      antibiotic treatment seems logical. Thus, C-Reactive Protein allowed not only knowing when to
      start antibiotics, but also through their kinetic, these markers can guide the duration of
      therapy and shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy: a rate cut would ensure that the
      antibiotic treatment was adopted.

      The objectives of this randomized prospective and double blind study are to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of a short treatment of 48 with levofloxacin compared with treatment with
      the same molecule during a time guided by monitoring markers of inflammation in patients
      admitted to the emergency for exacerbation of COPD and to study the epidemiology of viral and
      bacterial COPD decompensation.

      This study is a randomized prospective double-blind, accomplished with sealed envelopes ,with
      three parallel groups :

        -  Group A: Short treatment: 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg / day hang two days completed by 1
           tablet Placebo Levofloxacin 500mg / day for 5 days.

        -  Group B: Short Treatment control : 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg / day for 7 days.

        -  Group C: Titled treatment by inflammation markers (CRP): 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg /
           day for 7 days.

        -  Group D: Titled treatment by inflammation markers (CRP) Control : 1 tablet Levofloxacin
           500mg / day hang two days completed by 1 tablet Placebo Levofloxacin 500mg / day for 5
           days.

      We started our study by recruitment COPD patients to collect their blood samples and sputum
      samples and we made them up for control. These samples will be used for the inflammatory
      analyses and the study of bacterial and viral serology. The results were seized by the
      SPSS.18.0 software.
