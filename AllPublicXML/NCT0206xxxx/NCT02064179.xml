  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of heparin and aspirin for their respective anticoagulation and antiplatelet effects
      is routine in intensive care units around the country and world in children who have
      undergone surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) who are at risk for thrombosis after
      repair. Most common protocols recommend heparin infusions after surgery with transition to
      oral aspirin when oral intake begins. Patients at risk for thrombosis after congenital heart
      surgery requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy include those undergoing shunt placement for
      single-ventricle palliation or establishment of pulmonary blood flow, valve replacements, or
      coronary artery manipulation. Post-operative thrombosis after congenital heart surgery is
      rare, but thrombosis can result in death. The routine use of aspirin in these patients is
      intended to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of thrombosis. However, there
      is no routine clinical assessment of the platelet inhibitory effect of aspirin; nor have
      there been any prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of aspirin's antiplatelet
      effect in children after congenital heart surgery. No data exists to suggest that the first
      dose of aspirin transition from heparin infusion is either sufficient or insufficient in its
      antiplatelet effect.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the first aspirin dose in
      its antiplatelet effects after surgery for congenital heart disease. Degree of antiplatelet
      effect will be evaluated with thromboelastograph (TEG) and TEG-platelet mapping study
      analysis. Thromboelastography is a clinical laboratory method of assessing whole blood
      hemostasis and allows for assessment of clot formation, strength, and stability. TEG is most
      commonly used in patients at risk for bleeding or thrombosis and also to monitor antiplatelet
      therapies (such as aspirin).

      The investigators hypothesize: the first dose of aspirin transitioned from heparin infusion
      after congenital heart surgery is sufficient in its antiplatelet effect as tested by TEG and
      TEG-platelet mapping studies. Confirmation of the antiplatelet effect of aspirin will help
      support the current practice of empiric aspirin therapy to prevent post-operative thrombosis
      in children after congenital heart surgery.

        The study population includes children aged 0-18 with congenital heart disease (CHD) in the
        immediate post- operative period who receive heparin infusion prior to initiation of
        long-term antiplatelet therapy. The current study population includes patients who have
        undergone one of these surgeries requiring aspirin therapy. The following are the surgical
        procedures included in this study:

          1. Arterio-venous shunts: classic and modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunts, and central
             shunts.

          2. Veno-venous shunts: partial cavo-pulmonary connections (Glenn anastomosis), total
             cavo-pulmonary shunts (Fontan), and right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits.

          3. Patients requiring coronary artery re-implantation: arterial switch operation for
             transposition of the great arteries and repair of anomalous left coronary artery
             arising from the pulmonary artery.

          4. Pulmonary valve replacement.

             infusion.
