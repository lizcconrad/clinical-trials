  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation addresses emotional health in community dwelling persons with traumatic
      brain injury (TBI). It is designed to test the efficacy of a novel behavioral treatment for
      depression and anxiety symptoms. This treatment incorporates principles of Behavioral
      Activation (BA), a promising treatment model for depression and anxiety after TBI, and
      implementation intentions, a theoretically motivated method to enhance enactment of
      goal-relevant behaviors via action planning. To maximize the impact of this intervention over
      time, we use the low-cost, widely available technology of SMS, or text messaging, to promote
      positive behavior change in accordance with planned goals and intentions. Participants are
      randomized 2:1 to a condition using BA-based implementation intentions or to a control
      condition in which participants receive SMS messages with self-selected motivational
      statements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study employs a 2-group randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of a
      treatment based on BA using SMS message reminders (ie text messages) containing
      self-statements in the form of implementation intentions. These implementation intentions are
      created collaboratively by participants and therapists in a single 2-hour session that uses
      principles of brief BA, which incorporates the translation of important life values into the
      planning of rewarding activities that support those values.

      Participants will be randomized 2:1 to a condition using BA-based implementation intentions
      delivered daily x 8 weeks (Intention group) or to a control condition in which participants
      receive a 2-hour session with education on the importance of self-confidence and motivation,
      followed by 8 weeks of daily SMS messages with self-selected motivational statements
      (Motivation group). This condition will control for non-specific motivating effects of
      attention from a therapist and the novelty or &quot;alerting&quot; value of receiving SMS messages,
      without the hypothesized &quot;active ingredient&quot; provided by reminding of specific action plans
      (intentions). Participants in both groups will be contacted by phone at 4 weeks to offer
      modifications or replacements for their messages. We will compare groups on change over 8
      weeks on: (1) perceived degree of environmental reward, (2) degree of behavioral activation,
      (3) emotional status, (4) societal participation, and (5) satisfaction with life.

    <description>EROS is a recently developed tool with good psychometric properties that provides a direct measure of exposure to environmental reward, an increase of which is the proposed mechanism of changes in mood state with BA treatment. Scores have been shown to account for incremental variance in time spent in high- and low-reward behaviors, over and above the variance attributable to depressive symptoms.</description>
