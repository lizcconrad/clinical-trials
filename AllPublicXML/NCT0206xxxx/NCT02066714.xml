      Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease in childhood. Several
      enteroviruses are associated with the disease. However, since 1997, large outbreaks of HFMD
      in Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam have seen unusual neurological complications such as
      brainstem encephalitis with rare fatal outcomes. The pathogen associated with this severe
      disease is Enterovirus 71.

      In 2011, Vietnam had a large outbreak of Hand Foot and mouth disease resulting in 110,000
      cases and 164 deaths. HFMD affects children during their early years of child development,
      but there is limited information on what the potential long-term consequences are. Small
      studies have suggested language and cognitive difficulties in more severe disease but this
      has not been evaluated in a large cohort.

      Internationally recognized and standardized assessment tools are not available for early
      childhood in Vietnam. This project will translate and adapt the Bayley Scales of Toddler and
      Infant Development 3rd edition (Bayley III) and Movement ABC, 2nd edition (MABC) into
      Vietnamese as outcome measures.

      This study will evaluate whether there are neurodevelopment difficulties following severe
      HFMD. The study design is a prospective observational cohort study. Hospitalised children
      with a clinical diagnosis of HFMD will be eligible to enroll. Written parental consent will
      be required. Participants enrolled will be assessed 3 times over 18 months from discharge
      from hospital into the study. Since there is no standardization of Bayley III or MABC for
      Vietnam, a healthy cohort, age and sex matched to the least severe HFMD participants will be
      recruited. This healthy cohort will follow the same assessment program over 18 months. A
      total of 350 HFMD participants and 150 healthy children (matched to the least severe HFMD
      participants) will be recruited.

      Background:

      Hand foot and mouth disease outbreaks associated with enterovirus 71 (EV71) were unusual in
      their neurological manifestations. Since 1997, Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam have experienced
      large outbreaks of EV71-HFMD.

      Neurological manifestations include meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, and rare
      cardiopulmonary failure, thought to be neurogenic in origin.

      In Vietnam, children are admitted to hospital if they show signs of systemic disease. The
      Vietnam Ministry of Health has developed a grading system to stratify management and
      intervention. Grade 1 have solely the typical rash on palms of hands, soles on feet and
      buttock with ulcers in the mouth. Grade 2 have systemic features such has high fever,
      irritability and myoclonus. Grade 2 is split into 2a for parental report of symptoms or 2b if
      a health professional has observed neurological signs. Grade 2 onwards are admitted to
      hospital. Grade 3 develop irregular breathing, persistent tachycardia, hypertension, all
      features of autonomic disturbance due to brainstem encephalitis. Grade 4 develop often fatal
      cardiopulmonary failure, believed to be a consequence of excessive unopposed sympathetic
      activation from brainstem disease.

      Different countries use different grading or staging systems for HFMD. A study in 142 EV71
      suggested children affected at a younger age of onset of disease might have consequences for
      verbal comprehension. In 63 children with EV71 disease, 14% had cognitive or motor deficits.

      Hypothesis and Aims:

      The study aims to identify the neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes following severe
      (hospitalised) HFMD in Vietnam.

      Study Design:

      Prospective observational cohort study. There are two cohorts in this study. The HFMD
      participants and healthy children. All children hospitalized with HFMD are eligible for
      participation. From preliminary review of admissions to the hospital, we identified the
      majority of patients were admitted from a local district in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (District
      8). All participants will be asked if they agree for an optional brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI).

      We will approach kindergartens in that district to enroll healthy children, and also approach
      participants in another Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, HCMC study run at a local
      obstetric hospital to enroll healthy infants. This healthy cohort will be age and sex matched
      to the least severe grade of HFMD participants.

      HFMD will have neurological and neurodevelopmental assessments carried out 1 week after
      discharge, 6 months later and the last assessment 18 months after the initial assessment. The
      Healthy cohort will have a neurodevelopmental assessment at enrollment. 6 months and 18
      months after the initial assessment.

      Primary Outcomes

        1. Comparison of neurodevelopment scores at discharge, at 6 and at 18 months of follow up
           between least severe HFMD children and an age and sex matched healthy comparison cohort.

        2. Comparison of neurodevelopment scores at 1 week after discharge, at 6 and at 18 months
           after discharge between children stratified by HFMD disease grade.

      Other Outcomes

      1. Descriptive Brain MRI Changes according to severity of HFMD

      Sample size and analysis plan:

      We aim to include up to 350 children with HFMD grade 2a, 2b, 3 and 4, and 150 healthy
      children (matched for Grade 2a) and follow them up at enrolment, 6 and 18 months of
      follow-up.

      The Bayley scoring system has a mean score of 100 with a standard deviation (SD) of 15 in
      healthy American children. Based on this, we assume an SD of approximately 15 in all 5 study
      populations. As little is known about within-child longitudinal changes in Bailey scores over
      time, power considerations are based on pair-wise comparisons between groups at each time
      point separately. With the sample sizes given, we will have 80% power at the two-sided 5%
      significance level to detect differences in mean scores of - 7.4 or larger between grade 2a
      or 2b children compared to grade 3 or 4 children, respectively.

      Statistical Methods Standard data summaries such as median (inter-quartile range) for
      continuous variables and frequency (%) for categorical variable together with graphical
      summaries (histograms, box plots and scatterplots) will be used for descriptive analyses in
      all studies.

      Longitudinal profiles of development scores over time will be visualized by line plots of
      individual subjects' data with overlaid smoothed lines for average development scores over
      time within groups. Modeling of longitudinal profiles over time and group comparisons will be
      based on standard methods for longitudinal data analysis such as linear mixed effects models.

      Potential Impact:

      To public health implications of HFMD require evaluation of long-term. If the burden of
      disease continues to have a neurological impact on a significant proportion of children, a
      vaccine-based approach is essential and cost-effective.

      As intense efforts are underway in vaccine development, research is essential in helping
      clinicians on the front line to identify the minority of children who may progress and focus
      limited resources appropriately.

    <description>The Vietnamese Ministry of Health has a clinical grading system. Grade 1 disease is uncomplicated and are not admitted to hospital. Grade 2 and above are admitted to hospital with clinical features of neurological or systemic involvement. Grade 2 is split into Grade 2a and 2b depending if neurological manifestations such as myoclonus have been witnessed by the parents or by a health professional. In total, it is anticipated that 125 Grade 2a and 125 Grade 2b and 100 more severe Grade 3 and 4 will be recruited over one year. A subset who agree for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also have a scan done during their hospital admission.</description>
