    <textblock>
      The study evaluates LIFE-DM, an integrated microfinance and collaborative care intervention
      by comparing it to enhanced treatment as usual (national guideline antidepressant care and
      referral to microfinance resources) in Vietnam. Intervention effects at baseline, 6 month,
      and 12 month follow-up on patient outcomes, including depression, anxiety, quality of life,
      functioning, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and income will be compared across the two
      conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the largest contributors to the world's health burden. Prior work in the
      Partners in Care study has shown that evidence-based service delivery programs for depression
      can improve health outcomes in depressed patients, and especially in minorities, largely
      overcoming disparities in outcomes from care between whites and minorities. Effective
      treatments exist, but they do not reach many depressed individuals, especially in
      resource-poor communities--ethnic minorities, rural residents in the United States, and
      individuals in most of the developing world.

      Women, in particular, are at risk for depression and poverty. Integrating programs that treat
      depression and address livelihood concerns may improve engagement in depression treatment and
      improve mental health and functioning for patients in low-resource settings. The proposed
      study would integrate depression care with existing &quot;microfinance&quot; programs, which provide
      poverty-alleviation services including small loans, savings programs, and vocational training
      to women.

      This project will (1) conduct qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators of women's
      successful use of existing depression care and microfinance programs; (2) adapt and integrate
      the depression care and microfinance services; (3) train Women's Union facilitators to
      deliver the integrated depression care and microfinance program; and conduct evaluation of
      LIFE-DM program to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness. The
      non-randomized control trial compares the integrated microfinance and collaborative care
      intervention with enhanced treatment as usual (national guideline antidepressant care and
      referral to microfinance resources) at the Women's Union in Danang city in Vietnam.

    <measure>Change in Depression Score from the Patient Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a nine-item validated tool measuring depressive symptoms based on DSM-IV criteria. The answers are rated on a scale from zero (not at all) to three (nearly every day). Total scores range from 0-27, subdivided into five categories of depression severity: 1 to 4 is minimal; 5 to 9 is mild; 10 to 14 is moderate; 15 to 19 is moderate-severe; and 20 and above is severe. The PHQ-9 has been widely used internationally including in Vietnam.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Score from Quality of Life and Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire is a self-report measure designed to enable investigators to easily obtain sensitive measures of the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning. The summary scores were found to be reliable and valid measures of these dimensions in a group of depressed outpatients. The Q-LES-Q measures were related to, but not redundant with, measures of overall severity of illness or severity of depression within this sample. These findings suggest that the Q-LES-Q measures may be sensitive to important differences among depressed patients that are not detected by the measures usually employed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy Score from Self Efficacy Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Items were developed to assess effectiveness of a goal-setting and planning intervention (Macleod et al., 2008). Self-efficacy is assessed via 4-items that measure locus of control, materials and skills to complete goals, confidence, and optimism. Self-efficacy is rated on a 9-point scale from 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 9 (&quot;To a great extent&quot;).</description>

    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A brief, multidimensional, selfadministered, social support survey that was developed for patients in the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), a two-year study of patients with chronic conditions.

    <measure>Change in health and mental health functioning scores from Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12v2 is a 12-item survey that measures the same eight domains of health. The domains scores are summarized into two composite scores: Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores. The survey is a brief, reliable measure of overall health status. It is useful in large population health surveys and has been used in Vietnamese populations.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anxiety Symptom Score from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7-item anxiety scale used for screening and assessing symptom severity of GAD. GAD and depression symptoms frequently occurred together, but factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions, and they had independent effects on functional impairment and disability. Self-report and interviewer-administered versions of GAD-7 were in good agreement.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MINI is a brief structured psychiatric interview used to diagnose for multiple axis I DSM-IV mental disorders. In this study, the MINI is used to assess for major depressive episodes. Using DSM-IV criteria (at least 5 symptoms of depression over a 2 week period; endorsement of depressed mood or anhedonia were necessary for diagnosis) the interviewers can distinguish between past, current, and recurrent episodes of depression. The MINI is a reliable and valid alternative to the longer Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic. The MINI has been used widely in developing countries and administered by non-mental health providers.</description>
