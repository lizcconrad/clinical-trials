  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of 2 different hydration strategies, hydration according to clinical
      guideline and adequate hydration, on contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with STEMI
      undergoing primary PCI to investigate the possible beneficial role of periprocedural adequate
      hydration.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      all consecutive patients with STEMI，age at least 18 years, who were candidates for primary
      PCI at our institution were considered for enrollment in the present study. Initial exclusion
      criteria were contrast medium administration within the previous 14 days, end-stage renal
      failure requiring dialysis, and refusal to give informed consent. Eligible patients were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive preprocedure and postprocedure hydration
      (adequate hydration group), hydration according to clinical guideline (guideline hydration
      group，control group )
