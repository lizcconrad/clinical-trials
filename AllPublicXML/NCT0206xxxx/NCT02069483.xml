  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers who are not actively engaged in quitting will participate in a study using
      self-generated text and audio text messages containing reasons to quit smoking.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants must have a smartphone that can accept text messages from an email address and
      link to a study related website to hear audio recordings, and be willing to receive a text
      message each weekday for two weeks between 8-9am as part of the study. After completing a
      phone screener, participants will complete a baseline phone survey. Within two weeks of the
      baseline survey, participants will come to an in-person session. At that time they will be
      randomized with equal probability to one of two conditions: 1) Motivational Interviewing
      (MI), or 2) tailored feedback on reasons for quitting. After undergoing MI or receiving
      tailored feedback, participants will be asked to generate message that they feel would
      motivate them to quit. These messages will be both text and audio. After generating and
      reviewing these messages, participants will then evaluate these messages before ending the
      laboratory session. Starting two days after their laboratory session, between 8:00am and
      9:00am, staff will send participants one of the self-generated text messages with a link to
      also hear the message; this process will last for two weeks. Within a week of stopping
      sending messages, participants will be asked to complete a final phone survey to elicit
      smoking behaviors and provided feedback on the messaging.
